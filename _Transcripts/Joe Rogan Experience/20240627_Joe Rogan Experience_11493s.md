# Joe Rogan Experience #1936 - Krystal Ball & Saagar Enjeti
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6.0s)]
*  Alright, now the first time we did this, my hair was fucked up the whole time and neither one of y'all told me about it, so I hope we're better friends now. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10.0s)]
*  You just don't say a word. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=21.0s)]
*  Is that recorded? Did you record that? We should leave that part out. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=24.0s)]
*  I was just like, you look beautiful, Crystal. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=27.0s)]
*  I watched it afterwards and I was like, what the fuck? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=30.0s)]
*  Yeah, wait, okay, number one is different. Number two, I had like, this piece was like, protruding. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=33.0s)]
*  I've been bald, shaved head for like 13 years now or something like that, so I don't even think about it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=38.0s)]
*  Like, your hair is fucked up, I'm like, who cares? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=44.0s)]
*  I get it. I get it. Sorry. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=47.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was a real betrayal, but it's okay. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=50.0s)]
*  I'm so sorry. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=52.0s)]
*  It's really on him, because you and I were just getting to know each other, so it was really his fault. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=53.0s)]
*  No, man. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=58.0s)]
*  You guys are a very unusual combination. It's very funny, because having someone who's on the right and having someone on the left, it's usually like some sort of a formulaic thing. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=59.0s)]
*  You know what I think of Hannity and Combs? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=70.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=73.0s)]
*  Do you remember that? Oh, god! [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=74.0s)]
*  Well, because it was fake. That was the thing. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=75.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=77.0s)]
*  It's kind of hard to describe what we do, because if you say like, you know, we're on the right, we're on the left, it does sound like this sort of thing. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=78.0s)]
*  Little bit country. I'm a little bit rock and roll. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=86.0s)]
*  Yes, or like that terrible CNN show, Crossfire, is the other thing. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=89.0s)]
*  Who was on that one? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=95.0s)]
*  Well, the original one was Tucker. Paul Bacala. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=96.0s)]
*  Fuck, there were two words. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=99.0s)]
*  And then they did the reboot of it, which was rough. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=101.0s)]
*  Tucker was on the right, and Bacala was on the left. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=104.0s)]
*  And Tucker used to have bow tie on. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=108.0s)]
*  That was when he had the bow tie. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=110.0s)]
*  And he's never lived down. People still, in their head, I feel like that's the picture they get of Tucker, even though he hasn't worn it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=111.0s)]
*  He hasn't worn a bow tie in 15 years. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=119.0s)]
*  But it's just like seared into people's memories that this is what this man wears. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=120.0s)]
*  That's Peter Hotez, too. There's something about bow ties. There's Crossfire. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=125.0s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=129.0s)]
*  So that's Carville. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=130.0s)]
*  And there's the infamous Jon Stewart when he just destroyed that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=131.0s)]
*  Yeah, and then they did the remake with Newt Gingrich. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=136.0s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=139.0s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=140.0s)]
*  Oh, and elegant Spitzer was on there, right? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=141.0s)]
*  No, that was another terrible show. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=142.0s)]
*  So Newt Gingrich and Van Jones. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=146.0s)]
*  That was Stephanie Cutter, who was one of the most unlikable people ever created. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=148.0s)]
*  And then Essie Cuff is actually a long time. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=154.0s)]
*  She and I were at MSNBC together, so she and I are friends, so I can't say anything bad about her. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=157.0s)]
*  She seems nice. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=162.0s)]
*  She's a very nice person. I love her. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=163.0s)]
*  I don't know who that other lady is. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=165.0s)]
*  Stephanie Cutter? She works for Obama. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=167.0s)]
*  She didn't like, yeah, I think. Was she a Hillary person? I can't remember. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=169.0s)]
*  I can't watch those shows. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=174.0s)]
*  It was bad. Anyway, that's not what we're doing, I hope. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=176.0s)]
*  What is really, no, you're not doing that at all, but what is really fascinating is that having these long form discussions like you guys do, uncensored and undirected, right, without an executive leaning over your shoulder and telling you what to do, it's the best way to discuss things. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=179.0s)]
*  And when I get to hear from a reasonable person on the left and a reasonable person on the right who respect each other, it's like, it gives me hope. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=197.0s)]
*  Like, hey, we can all get along. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=205.0s)]
*  Like, we can sort through what's good and what's bad. It's possible. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=207.0s)]
*  That is actually the core goal of the show. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=212.0s)]
*  Because, I mean, we are living through incredibly, like, politically fraught times where you have a lot of people whose whole business model is to persuade you that, like, half the country hates you and is just trying to get you to do something. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=216.0s)]
*  The other half of the country hates you and is destroying the country and it's existential and we're headed to civil war. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=226.0s)]
*  And so I feel like if Sager and I can, you know, agree on some things, which we do, and have debates on topics that are, you know, difficult and tense and fraught and be able to do that day after day in a way that is respectful, that's like, not just trying to score points but actually trying to learn from each other. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=231.0s)]
*  I hope it makes a small difference in the political atmosphere. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=250.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=254.0s)]
*  I mean, what I'm most proud of in our analytics is, like, half the audience is genuinely right and half the audience is genuinely left. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=255.0s)]
*  And one of the pitches that we give our people, we're like, hey, if you're going to support us, like, you're not going to agree all the time. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=261.0s)]
*  So you're almost conditioning people to be like, hey, this is a message that I'm buying into. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=266.0s)]
*  And I think the most impactful, like, sometimes you don't meet people or whatever and they're like, man, you know, I watched a show with my dad and I'm just like, dad, like, crystal is what I believe. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=271.0s)]
*  And dad is like, I'm with Sager on some things and we sit down and we talk about it afterwards and like that, we're building that for people. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=278.0s)]
*  That's so important. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=284.0s)]
*  Yeah, because that is one of the dangers in independent media. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=285.0s)]
*  There's a lot that's so exciting about independent media right now. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=290.0s)]
*  I mean, you see the traditional media is just like dying. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=293.0s)]
*  The ratings are failing. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=296.0s)]
*  People are abandoning them in droves. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=298.0s)]
*  Obviously, trust has completely fallen off a cliff. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=300.0s)]
*  But there are some pitfalls in independent media, too. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=302.0s)]
*  And one of them is that you develop an audience that is one ideology that just wants to hear one thing and is there to hear what they already think about things. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=305.0s)]
*  And so I think because of the fact that we have different opinions and our different, you know, political ideologies that has sort of protected us against having an audience that is there for any one particular idea. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=314.0s)]
*  And, you know, we'll see sometimes like people go, oh, you guys said this and that. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=328.0s)]
*  We disagree with you. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=332.0s)]
*  And it's like, you know what? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=333.0s)]
*  If this isn't the thing for you, you owe it to yourself to go somewhere else where you're going to hear every day, I guess, whatever it is that you want to be told from within your bubble. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=334.0s)]
*  Well, I think you guys have reached a point where I have to give you the speech and it's like you got to stop paying attention to the comments. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=342.0s)]
*  It's so true. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=349.0s)]
*  I've been giving this speech for like three years. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=351.0s)]
*  I've been giving this speech. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=353.0s)]
*  I'm telling you, I'm right. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=354.0s)]
*  I'm right on this. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=355.0s)]
*  You are. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=356.0s)]
*  Kyle actually preaches this to me all the time. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=357.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, Kyle's indoctrinated. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=360.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's fully bought in. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=362.0s)]
*  He's fully on board with the philosophy. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=364.0s)]
*  It's so true, though. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=366.0s)]
*  It's true. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=367.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like you feel like you should engage with your fans and everything like that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=368.0s)]
*  But you just got to tell them, look, I love you guys. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=371.0s)]
*  Just I'm not reading your shit. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=374.0s)]
*  I love you. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=376.0s)]
*  I love you. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=377.0s)]
*  I do this for you. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=378.0s)]
*  I hope you enjoy it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=379.0s)]
*  I'm happy that you enjoy it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=380.0s)]
*  I'm not reading your shit. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=381.0s)]
*  The hardest is whenever it's like people who pay like help support the show and they'll [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=382.0s)]
*  be like, I pay $10 a month and like, I pay you to represent me. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=386.0s)]
*  I'm just like, all right, man, then maybe you should cancel because that's actually [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=390.0s)]
*  not what we're here for. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=392.0s)]
*  Not reading that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=393.0s)]
*  I'm not engaging. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=394.0s)]
*  I'm not fuck you and you. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=395.0s)]
*  I'm not going to do that. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=397.0s)]
*  That shit will get in your head too. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=399.0s)]
*  It will. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=401.0s)]
*  And it will mess with you in terms of like just your clarity of thought. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=402.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=405.0s)]
*  I mean, the trade off is sometimes people do have good critiques, valid critiques, good [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=406.0s)]
*  ideas, whatever. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=410.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=411.0s)]
*  So you do, you know, there is a trade off there. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=412.0s)]
*  You're missing some of that. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=414.0s)]
*  But ultimately I also buy into the the Rogan philosophy of just don't read the shit. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=415.0s)]
*  Well, as you guys get bigger and bigger, the numbers become more and more untenable. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=420.0s)]
*  It just becomes ridiculous. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=425.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's true too. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=426.0s)]
*  You just can't engage. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=427.0s)]
*  And it's also we are creatures of community. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=428.0s)]
*  And when there is any negativity, that negativity gets highlighted so much more so than positivity. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=432.0s)]
*  And by the way, you don't need positivity. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=440.0s)]
*  You're good. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=442.0s)]
*  You guys know you're good. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=443.0s)]
*  You guys, you know what I'm saying? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=444.0s)]
*  Like your objective. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=445.0s)]
*  You neither one of you has is crazy. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=446.0s)]
*  You know, you should. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=448.0s)]
*  Yeah, but you're not. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=450.0s)]
*  You don't have a distorted perception of what you do. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=451.0s)]
*  You guys do great. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=454.0s)]
*  You do great work. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=455.0s)]
*  You try hard. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=456.0s)]
*  You can't like those little negative ones, they will get in your fucking head. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=457.0s)]
*  Yeah, because we're creatures of community and that person that you don't know that lives [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=462.0s)]
*  in fucking Indiana that is on meth and is like really mad because the progressive in her [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=466.0s)]
*  district doesn't represent her views. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=472.0s)]
*  And she's like typing the meanest fucking shit. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=474.0s)]
*  Like, even though you know that that's nonsense, this is probably a crazy person that's in [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=477.0s)]
*  your head now. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=482.0s)]
*  You know, the toughest thing actually was when we and by doing the show is actually [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=483.0s)]
*  by disconnecting from the broader like because in traditional media, the way it works is [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=486.0s)]
*  like we used to go on Fox when you're in Fox is like an ecosystem. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=490.0s)]
*  You're in the green room. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=494.0s)]
*  There's all the other conservatives that are around you. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=495.0s)]
*  And then there's all these other people who work in pro conservative ink, like conservative [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=497.0s)]
*  world. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=500.0s)]
*  And you're not if you can't dissent. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=501.0s)]
*  And actually the best, most rewarding part of our show is we're not connected to the [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=503.0s)]
*  system anymore. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=506.0s)]
*  I'm like, I don't give a shit. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=507.0s)]
*  Like, they're like, I don't really appreciate what you see on Trump's person or whatever. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=508.0s)]
*  Some Trump flackies like you didn't say this about President Trump. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=511.0s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=514.0s)]
*  I'm like, what are you going to do? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=515.0s)]
*  You're going to take me on Fox. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=516.0s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=517.0s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=518.0s)]
*  I actually want to be on Fox. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=519.0s)]
*  I'm like, I could be on my own show. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=520.0s)]
*  I'm like, being disconnected from like the broader DC machine, it totally frees you up [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=521.0s)]
*  for conversation on stop this deal. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=525.5s)]
*  Anything, anything that's controversial. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=527.6s)]
*  And I think this is bullshit. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=528.6s)]
*  I truly 100% guys, I believe this is bullshit. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=530.6s)]
*  I see commentators out there who I know don't believe what they're saying and are saying [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=533.72s)]
*  it because they have to. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=538.4s)]
*  They have to maintain their context. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=539.4s)]
*  They maintain their salary. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=540.4s)]
*  That's the corruption. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=541.4s)]
*  That's horrible. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=542.4s)]
*  And that's like a self-imposed corruption if you're doing that online. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=543.4s)]
*  And some people are doing it online. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=548.4s)]
*  You guys are not. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=550.36s)]
*  And I really appreciate it. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=551.36s)]
*  I know that I'm watching you guys. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=552.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm getting like real opinions. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=554.2s)]
*  Like I'm getting well thought out, informed opinions. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=555.96s)]
*  And you guys are going to be cool to each other. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=560.6s)]
*  I mean, we take it, we do take it really seriously. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=563.08s)]
*  And I think we take it this year even more so than ever. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=566.5600000000001s)]
*  Our biggest podcast download and our biggest YouTube numbers last year were right when [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=572.2s)]
*  Russia invaded Ukraine. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=577.52s)]
*  You know, you talk about a high stakes situation where it's very difficult to sort through [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=580.04s)]
*  all the propaganda to really figure out what's going on. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=584.24s)]
*  And you know, we were trying our best to do that in real time. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=587.1999999999999s)]
*  In the fact that so many people came to us to try to understand this conflict and what [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=591.0s)]
*  the US's role in it, what it should be, that really meant a lot, number one. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=595.96s)]
*  But it also, I think, put on both of our shoulders like a real sense of, all right, we got to [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=601.64s)]
*  make sure we're on top of our show. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=606.4399999999999s)]
*  We got to read as much as we possibly can. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=607.88s)]
*  We need to go back and look at like a Russian nuclear doctrine and just go as deep as we [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=609.88s)]
*  possibly are capable of on this topic. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=613.76s)]
*  Because there are a lot of people who tell us we're it in terms of the news that they [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=617.32s)]
*  consume. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=621.8s)]
*  So we have shifted to focusing, you know, we still do like fun and stupid and silly [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=622.88s)]
*  topics or whatever and indulge whatever our little hobby horse interests are. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=627.2s)]
*  But we've shifted the program somewhat to do more hard news because we care about it, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=631.2s)]
*  because it's important, because there are a lot of people who are looking to us to understand [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=637.9200000000001s)]
*  what's going on in the world. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=640.8000000000001s)]
*  And also because ultimately, you know, if there's going to be an alternative to the, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=643.08s)]
*  you know, liars and propagandists at places like CNN and Fox News and MSNBC and some of [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=648.72s)]
*  the mainstream print outlets as well, you're going to have to have that kind of, you know, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=653.4s)]
*  serious coverage of hard news events that people feel like they can trust what you're [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=658.84s)]
*  presenting them. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=663.4000000000001s)]
*  And listen, we say all the time. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=664.4000000000001s)]
*  Sometimes we're going to fuck up. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=666.64s)]
*  Sometimes we're going to be wrong about something, we're going to predict something, it doesn't [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=668.5600000000001s)]
*  happen, whatever. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=670.44s)]
*  That is going to happen 100% of the time. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=672.28s)]
*  But what you can count on as far as we're always going to come back, we're going to [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=674.2s)]
*  correct it, we're going to own up to the mistakes. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=677.08s)]
*  And we are trying from the beginning, our very best to sort through what the truth of [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=679.24s)]
*  the situation is. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=682.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, every six months I do a monologue. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=683.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm like, here's everything I got wrong. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=685.76s)]
*  I was like, totally wrong about this. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=687.08s)]
*  People love it too. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=688.08s)]
*  Totally wrong about that. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=689.08s)]
*  And I'm like, here's what, here was my thought process at the time. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=690.08s)]
*  I'm like, I didn't think this was going to happen. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=692.28s)]
*  But man, Ukraine has been a doozy. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=693.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm like, we've said some controversial shit over the last couple of years. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=695.64s)]
*  I've never experienced a level of pushback than going against the Ukraine narrative. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=698.56s)]
*  That is like number one, the most controversial topic I have ever seen discussed yet in politics. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=703.0s)]
*  My favorite moment of the beginning of the Ukraine conflict was Candace Owens having [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=709.76s)]
*  a Twitter battle with the New York Times. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=717.28s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=719.2399999999999s)]
*  When the New York Times says to Candace Owens, like, where are you getting your information [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=720.2399999999999s)]
*  from their corrupt Ukraine? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=723.8s)]
*  And she goes, your newspaper? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=727.9599999999999s)]
*  And then she puts all these different links that show all the different stories from as [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=730.3199999999999s)]
*  recently as 2017 that talked about the immense corruption. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=735.4s)]
*  I mean, what the fuck is wrong with you guys? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=738.9599999999999s)]
*  You're supposed to be the New York Times. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=741.88s)]
*  This is one of the primary ways that we've been gaslit in this conflict is like, and [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=743.8s)]
*  it just came out. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=750.28s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=751.28s)]
*  You probably did. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=752.28s)]
*  Zelensky fired a bunch of his cabinet officials over corruption. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=753.76s)]
*  And it was like they were taking these fancy vacations to Europe. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=758.6s)]
*  One of them was accused of basically overcharging the military for meals. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=763.36s)]
*  And remember, I mean, the amount that we have sent to Ukraine propping up not only their [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=768.24s)]
*  military but their government, their economy, et cetera, when they're taking that money, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=773.1999999999999s)]
*  that's like coming directly out of the U.S. taxpayer pocket. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=778.12s)]
*  Nobody reported on any of this until Zelensky fired people. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=781.38s)]
*  And then we were allowed to be like, yeah, there's some problems with corruption there, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=785.54s)]
*  maybe a little bit. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=788.9s)]
*  Maybe we should like worry a little bit about where the weapons are going and what exactly [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=789.9s)]
*  is happening there. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=792.8199999999999s)]
*  But before then you weren't allowed to say it. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=793.8199999999999s)]
*  Even better, the Times actually changed its headline. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=794.8199999999999s)]
*  They were like Ukraine goes corruption drive. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=797.02s)]
*  And it was like Zelensky aims to stamp out corruption just to make it a little bit less [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=799.58s)]
*  like the appearance. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=804.22s)]
*  I have some fun numbers for everybody. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=805.22s)]
*  This is from a past monologue I've gone. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=806.86s)]
*  U.S. aid currently at $100 billion is double what the entire rest of the world has given [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=808.94s)]
*  to Ukraine in one year surpasses what we gave the Afghan military in 20 years. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=814.22s)]
*  The total amount to Ukraine now exceeds all U.S. military aid to the country of South [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=819.98s)]
*  Vietnam between 1956 and 1975. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=824.74s)]
*  Wow. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=828.0600000000001s)]
*  $100 billion. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=829.0600000000001s)]
*  And listen, I think what Russia did was wrong. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=832.1s)]
*  I think it's an atrocity. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=835.1400000000001s)]
*  I think the Ukrainian cause is just. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=836.4599999999999s)]
*  But the total lack of debate, the lack of willingness to say like, hey, when we got [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=839.66s)]
*  into this, what you sold to the American people is you're going to provide defensive weapons [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=845.8599999999999s)]
*  only. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=849.4599999999999s)]
*  So Ukraine could defend itself. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=850.4599999999999s)]
*  Now we're sending tanks. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=852.8199999999999s)]
*  Now we're sending it just came out longer range missiles. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=854.5999999999999s)]
*  These were things that were totally off the table. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=857.2199999999999s)]
*  And then suddenly, step by step by step, not only are they on the table, but you're not [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=859.8399999999999s)]
*  allowed to question it. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=864.4599999999999s)]
*  You're not allowed to say, hey, guys, are we setting ourselves up for World War Three [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=865.5799999999999s)]
*  here, which is something the president himself was talking about not very long ago and yet [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=869.6999999999999s)]
*  no debate. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=874.6999999999999s)]
*  And that's the thing that, you know, however you feel about the Ukraine conflict and, you [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=875.6999999999999s)]
*  know, the buildup to it and how we got here and all of those things, I think at the very [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=879.78s)]
*  base level, the total lack of an ability to have dissent and debate and understand the [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=884.5s)]
*  potential consequences of what we're doing. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=890.7s)]
*  That is fucking terrifying because we are talking about a nuclear armed superpower that [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=893.7800000000001s)]
*  we are engaged in a proxy war with. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=898.1800000000001s)]
*  And you're basically not allowed to say, hey, how does this end? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=900.46s)]
*  What do we need to do to try to get to negotiated settlement here? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=905.3000000000001s)]
*  How do we avoid having a conflict with this nuclear armed superpower? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=908.9000000000001s)]
*  World War Three seems like a bad thing to have on the table right now. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=912.5400000000001s)]
*  And you guys are one of the few voices of reason that will say that, that agree on both [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=916.3s)]
*  sides of the fence. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=923.26s)]
*  And this is a thing that I, there's a lot of videos out now and I don't know if these [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=924.9399999999999s)]
*  people get these videos, but I get them. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=930.18s)]
*  I get these videos of horrible war encounters in Russia and Ukraine. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=932.74s)]
*  It's horrendous. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=940.26s)]
*  It brings me to this thing that I think about a lot because I think about things that other [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=942.84s)]
*  people do for a living and their jobs. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=948.02s)]
*  I think about like, they live in a world that I don't understand. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=949.88s)]
*  You know, there's like the, like I'm fascinated by professional chess players. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=953.72s)]
*  They live in a world that I don't understand because I don't play chess. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=957.12s)]
*  I love the fact, I kind of know how the pieces move, but I've really only played like maybe [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=959.5600000000001s)]
*  10 times my whole life. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=963.44s)]
*  There's a thing that people have. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=966.0400000000001s)]
*  It's a quality of being a human being. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=968.48s)]
*  You only know what you know. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=970.2s)]
*  And other things become like these sort of like ethereal narratives. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=972.5600000000001s)]
*  They're not necessarily real. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=977.88s)]
*  And war is one of them. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=979.72s)]
*  War is one of them. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=981.72s)]
*  There's a thing that people, the way my friends who've served talk about war is so titanically [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=982.72s)]
*  different than the way people who ideologically support or disavow it. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=991.1600000000001s)]
*  Like, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about if you say there's no need for [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=996.8000000000001s)]
*  military. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1000.04s)]
*  You're crazy. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1001.04s)]
*  We are going to get subjugated. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1002.04s)]
*  Someone will come here with men with guns. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1003.8s)]
*  If you take away all the guns that everybody has and no more military, we're fucked. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1006.36s)]
*  And if you don't think that, it's because you've never gone to the dark parts of the [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1010.68s)]
*  world, or you've never gone on telegram. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1014.4399999999999s)]
*  I'll send you some videos. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1015.88s)]
*  I saw a guy get killed with a hammer yesterday. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1016.88s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1019.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, this is so important for people to understand, which is that we are 75 years removed from [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1020.7199999999999s)]
*  what war on the European continent actually looks like. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1025.24s)]
*  And you know, Joe, I'm the same way. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1028.12s)]
*  I've been on fucking live leak, you know, since I was like 12, which is probably bad [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1029.56s)]
*  for you, but terrible for you. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1032.72s)]
*  Terrible for you. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1034.72s)]
*  My girlfriend's like, what are you watching? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1035.72s)]
*  I'm like, what? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1037.72s)]
*  And she's like a beheading or something. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1038.72s)]
*  My wife will come into my office and I have to pause videos. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1040.64s)]
*  And I'm like, you really want to see this? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1043.64s)]
*  They always say yes, but then they can't handle it. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1045.64s)]
*  I can't handle it. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1047.96s)]
*  I can't handle it. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1048.96s)]
*  I don't do well with blood. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1049.96s)]
*  The point though is that, you know, we have to try and convey this to people and just [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1052.08s)]
*  say like, hey, when you're on Twitter and you're like, hey, you know, fuck you, you [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1055.0s)]
*  know, anybody who's against an air. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1058.1200000000001s)]
*  You're like, this is not a joke. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1059.64s)]
*  Like hundreds of thousands of Russians are dead. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1060.64s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands are Ukrainians are dead. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1062.92s)]
*  Millions are displaced. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1065.16s)]
*  We have no idea what the end game is like. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1066.96s)]
*  And, you know, just what Crystal was saying, I have this thing where, you know, the Fight [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1069.72s)]
*  Club line, like on a long enough timeline, I'm like on a long enough timeline, Ukraine [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1072.88s)]
*  is getting everything that it wanted. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1076.8400000000001s)]
*  So originally it was like no fly zone. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1078.04s)]
*  And Biden was like, I'm being responsible. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1079.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm saying no. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1081.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, first they ruled out Patriot missile systems. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1082.2s)]
*  Patriot missile systems are now on the way to Ukraine. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1084.48s)]
*  They ruled out tanks. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1086.6000000000001s)]
*  Now tanks are on the way to Ukraine right now. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1087.52s)]
*  There's an article talking about how F-16s they're thinking about sending Pentagon F-16s. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1089.64s)]
*  Biden says no now. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1094.1200000000001s)]
*  Right. Exactly. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1095.3600000000001s)]
*  We'll see. He was saying no to tanks. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1096.16s)]
*  Right. Like five days before they sent tanks. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1097.96s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1100.28s)]
*  He doesn't remember that, though. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1101.28s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1102.28s)]
*  And you got to dig deep, too. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1103.28s)]
*  Like, for example, originally we're like, we just want Ukraine to take back what it [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1105.4s)]
*  originally lost. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1109.04s)]
*  And listen, if I was Ukrainian, I'd be pushing for the same thing. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1110.3600000000001s)]
*  I have 100 percent sympathy. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1113.0s)]
*  They are not in the wrong here. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1114.64s)]
*  They've been invaded by a foreign and aggressive power. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1116.08s)]
*  That said, like, we got to think about what's best for us right now. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1118.8799999999999s)]
*  There's a New York Times article about U.S. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1122.32s)]
*  warms to helping Ukraine take back Crimea. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1124.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm like, well, hold on a fucking second. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1126.6s)]
*  I'm not saying it's just that Russia took Crimea in 2013, but they formally annexed [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1128.48s)]
*  it. And if you ask people in Russia, Crimea is Russia. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1133.08s)]
*  So if they use if Ukraine uses a Pentagon provided F-16 to bomb Crimea, now what? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1135.84s)]
*  Like now that's a violation of Russian nuclear doctrine. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1141.68s)]
*  They've updated their nuclear doctrine, by the way, to not even say it's defensive. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1145.32s)]
*  They can say they can use it in any capacity that Vladimir Putin wants to. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1148.56s)]
*  That was a significant change. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1152.68s)]
*  If you look in the history of the way that the great superpowers actually consider [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1154.8s)]
*  their own nuclear first strike use, it's something that is considered ironclad. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1159.04s)]
*  And then, boom, it changes like that. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1163.52s)]
*  You're not even going to hear about this. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1164.92s)]
*  And I was heartened a while back when there were some leaks that came out of the [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1165.88s)]
*  Biden administration that he at like a donor event in San Francisco or something, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1170.68s)]
*  said basically like, we're you know, we got to make sure we avoid World War Three. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1176.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm paraphrasing, but that was the he was like, we got to avoid nuclear war. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1179.96s)]
*  We got to avoid World War Three. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1183.4s)]
*  And I was like, OK, good. He's he's thinking about that. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1184.72s)]
*  That caution that existed at that point seems to be totally out of the window. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1188.0800000000002s)]
*  And if you read, you know, the official sort of like state state paper, the New [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1193.28s)]
*  York Times about the administration's thinking, they're like, well, you know, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1198.28s)]
*  Russia said this nuclear stuff and it didn't happen. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1202.8799999999999s)]
*  So they must just be bluffing. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1205.84s)]
*  It must just not be real. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1207.76s)]
*  And it's like, OK, number one, was there a timeline before they could press the [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1209.6s)]
*  button? Exactly. Oh, they didn't blow up the whole world yet. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1213.48s)]
*  So we should be fine. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1216.24s)]
*  I mean, that's insane. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1217.72s)]
*  Number one and number two, the idea that Russia hasn't escalated in response to [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1219.04s)]
*  our actions is just not true. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1224.36s)]
*  They've been striking critical energy infrastructure, including, you know, in [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1226.3999999999999s)]
*  and around Kiev, which was an escalation. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1230.04s)]
*  They went through with a conscription that there, you know, was very politically [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1232.72s)]
*  dicey for Putin. There's rumors that they may go through with another draft. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1236.96s)]
*  So the idea that they just like took all of this lying down and escalate is a [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1241.0s)]
*  fantasy to start with. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1244.8s)]
*  But it's incredibly dangerous and foolish to think just because they didn't push [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1246.04s)]
*  the nuclear button yet that, oh, it's all fine. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1250.0s)]
*  And he's just full of it. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1252.36s)]
*  Thank God there's people like you guys out there because there's so many people [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1253.76s)]
*  that they have Ukraine in the same category of importance and significance [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1257.52s)]
*  as they do climate change, climate change, which is a real thing. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1262.8s)]
*  But it's it's a politically divisive alleyway where you're not allowed to veer [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1267.4s)]
*  from the course and even look at any kind of science. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1272.88s)]
*  It's the same thing with Ukraine. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1275.76s)]
*  A support from you for Ukraine is undeniable. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1277.32s)]
*  You must put it in your Twitter bio. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1280.4s)]
*  And you guys are saying you're not saying don't support Ukraine, but you're saying [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1282.28s)]
*  look where this is going. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1285.68s)]
*  Do you understand what this is? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1287.24s)]
*  Because you can't just openly support something you don't understand [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1289.0800000000002s)]
*  without a comprehensive view of what the fuck the factors are and how it got to be [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1292.3600000000001s)]
*  that way in the first place. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1296.76s)]
*  And you're not going to hear that in a five minute clip on mainstream news. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1297.8400000000001s)]
*  You're just not going to. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1302.0800000000002s)]
*  It's so important for us to internalize that message. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1303.16s)]
*  We're not saying we don't we hate Ukraine. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1305.72s)]
*  We're not saying we don't even support Ukraine. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1307.92s)]
*  The Ukrainian cause is just we're saying is what about our interests? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1309.36s)]
*  All the there are interests that sub supersede Ukraine. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1313.12s)]
*  If I was Ukrainian, I would do exactly what they were doing. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1315.9199999999998s)]
*  But guess what? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1318.1599999999999s)]
*  Ukraine does not exist without the United States. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1319.0s)]
*  We provide the vast majority of the military there for the diplomacy perspective. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1321.12s)]
*  If we cut off military weapons to them tomorrow, that's it done. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1325.4399999999998s)]
*  They literally are forced to the negotiating table. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1328.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm not even saying we should do that. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1331.0s)]
*  I'm saying what is the end game? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1332.28s)]
*  And, you know, in my neighborhood, there's more Ukraine flags [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1334.3999999999999s)]
*  than there are American flags. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1336.6s)]
*  It's like Ukraine flag, gay pride flag, no American flag. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1338.08s)]
*  But then it's like, OK, if you go to those people [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1340.4399999999998s)]
*  and if you would just say what they said, they say this is disgusting. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1343.24s)]
*  This is Russian propaganda. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1345.36s)]
*  It's up to the Ukrainians for when they want to stop. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1346.8s)]
*  And I said, yeah, I completely agree. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1349.04s)]
*  But it's also up to us for whatever. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1350.8799999999999s)]
*  We stop providing them weapons. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1352.8799999999999s)]
*  We're like, hey, if you want to defend this part of your territory, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1354.28s)]
*  that's totally fine. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1356.8799999999999s)]
*  That's our end game. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1358.12s)]
*  My end game is not having a nuclear conflict, is making sure [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1359.1999999999998s)]
*  that we have peace on the European continent. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1363.32s)]
*  Vladimir Putin is an opposition to that piece, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1365.76s)]
*  but Putin and Russia are going to exist. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1368.84s)]
*  You know, something I think people should take home, too, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1371.04s)]
*  is you had Peter Zayhan on. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1373.24s)]
*  He said it really well, which is the first year of every [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1374.3999999999999s)]
*  Russian conflict is a total shit show. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1377.0s)]
*  If you look at Finland, if you look at the first year of Hitler's invasion, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1378.84s)]
*  even going all the way back to Napoleon and some of the czars campaigns before that, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1382.1999999999998s)]
*  they lose a shit ton of people. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1386.1999999999998s)]
*  It looks like a complete mess. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1387.6399999999999s)]
*  They fire a bunch of generals, all of this. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1388.84s)]
*  And then what do they do? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1390.76s)]
*  They use their vast Russian... [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1391.76s)]
*  The Russian Colossus is known of that for a reason, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1393.64s)]
*  because they have a shitload of people. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1395.84s)]
*  They have a lot of military materiel. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1397.32s)]
*  They amass it and they throw it at them. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1400.0s)]
*  And so people are like, you know, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1401.6000000000001s)]
*  Sager, Kristal, like what you guys are saying will be valid, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1403.4s)]
*  but Ukraine is winning. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1405.68s)]
*  Look, we are barely a year into this. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1406.92s)]
*  One year into the First World War, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1409.1200000000001s)]
*  I could make the easy case that Germany was going to win the First World War. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1410.76s)]
*  Second World War, I could easily make the case the Nazis were going to win. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1413.4s)]
*  If I go back to World War... Civil War, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1416.2s)]
*  I could easily make a case the Confederates were going to win. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1418.24s)]
*  All three of those, it didn't happen. Why? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1420.84s)]
*  Because these things go on for a long time. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1422.8s)]
*  Like you have no idea what it is. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1425.8799999999999s)]
*  And one of the reasons that many of those conflicts, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1427.9599999999998s)]
*  first and two, went on and ultimately came to the conclusion they were, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1430.0s)]
*  was because millions of lives were lost. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1433.52s)]
*  And the whole point from those conflicts, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1436.9199999999998s)]
*  if you look at the way that people talked, was we have to learn the lesson. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1438.56s)]
*  We have to learn the lesson. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1441.8799999999999s)]
*  But it's been 75 years and now this is all a game. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1442.84s)]
*  This is a tweet that people are saying about Ukraine, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1445.72s)]
*  but it says real world consequences for people. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1447.76s)]
*  That's it. That's it, exactly. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1449.56s)]
*  And the total lack of an ability to have a reason to debate [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1450.9199999999998s)]
*  without just being smeared as a propagandist is... [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1454.12s)]
*  Yes. Again, don't read the comments. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1456.36s)]
*  It is a terrifying moment. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1459.2s)]
*  And there's a couple things that do give me some heart, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1461.9199999999998s)]
*  which is number one, even though I can't really blame the people [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1466.3999999999999s)]
*  who can't understand seeing it another way, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1470.3999999999999s)]
*  because the propaganda that is coming from every network, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1473.48s)]
*  really, almost across the board, is very strong [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1476.92s)]
*  and it's very hard to avoid that. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1479.84s)]
*  So I have sympathy for that perspective. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1481.56s)]
*  But even so, a poll just came out that had, from NBC News, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1483.76s)]
*  they buried this at the very end of their write-up of the poll, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1487.64s)]
*  public's now 50-50 split on continuing aid to Ukraine. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1490.28s)]
*  So people are questioning, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1494.76s)]
*  even though they're being fed so much propaganda. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1497.4s)]
*  I think that is a credit to the rise of independent media. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1500.52s)]
*  I think it's also a credit to the fact [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1503.68s)]
*  that they don't fucking trust the mainstream press anymore. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1505.44s)]
*  But because of independent media, the trust is informed, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1507.92s)]
*  or the lack of trust, rather, is informed. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1511.52s)]
*  It's not just knee-jerk. I hope. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1513.76s)]
*  I mean, that's my hope, looking at those numbers. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1515.16s)]
*  I think your hope is 100% correct. I think you're right. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1517.3200000000002s)]
*  I think you guys are very important. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1520.0s)]
*  Glenn Greenwald, very important. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1521.72s)]
*  Jimmy Dore, very important. Kyle Kalinske, very important. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1523.68s)]
*  People who are real people that actually have done the homework [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1527.2s)]
*  and are going over the details and can inform people, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1530.44s)]
*  because there's so many people out there. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1534.04s)]
*  Like, I talked to Dave Smith about the history [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1535.64s)]
*  of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1539.12s)]
*  I was like, what? And he informed me about the coup in 2014. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1541.04s)]
*  There's a lot. There's a lot of backstory. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1544.6s)]
*  And then we played the video on the Colbert show, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1546.56s)]
*  the old Colbert show, which is just fucking crazy. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1550.4s)]
*  It's like Gideon something, the guy from the Times, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1553.08s)]
*  where he was like, what was it? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1555.16s)]
*  He's selling a book, and in the book, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1556.48s)]
*  he's comparing Russia and Ukraine to Batman and Robin. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1558.04s)]
*  And he's like, Ukraine is Robin, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1562.32s)]
*  and we want to take Robin and bring him over to our side. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1563.8s)]
*  And it's like this open secret that they're doing this. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1568.12s)]
*  There were cables that actually WikiLeaks released, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1572.56s)]
*  and a friend who's a great journalist, Bronco Marcetich, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1577.48s)]
*  who's been looking at the Ukraine conflict with a critical eye, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1581.1599999999999s)]
*  he sorted through these cables, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1585.72s)]
*  and he found all of these diplomatic cables [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1587.68s)]
*  from the prior era where you had NATO allies, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1590.6399999999999s)]
*  you had US officials who were all saying, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1594.8s)]
*  hey, guys, Russia has red lines here with regard to Ukraine, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1598.0s)]
*  and floating NATO membership with Ukraine [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1601.7199999999998s)]
*  is a real violation of their hard red lines, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1604.24s)]
*  and were very fearful. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1607.6399999999999s)]
*  And they laid out exactly the trajectory [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1608.6799999999998s)]
*  that we could find ourselves on. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1612.24s)]
*  Now, that doesn't deny Russia agency [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1614.24s)]
*  or Putin and the Kremlin agency for invading. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1617.76s)]
*  No one made them do that. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1620.96s)]
*  However, it is to say that there was a time [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1622.56s)]
*  when you were allowed to acknowledge [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1625.84s)]
*  that US policy could lead to this exact event. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1627.68s)]
*  And now when you even suggest that us, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1631.56s)]
*  floating NATO membership with Ukraine [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1635.0s)]
*  and saying that they were gonna be made a part, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1636.64s)]
*  that some of these things were exacerbating, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1638.1200000000001s)]
*  they crossed the red line, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1639.6000000000001s)]
*  and created a situation that was incredibly tense [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1640.52s)]
*  where this is the predictable outcome. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1643.24s)]
*  Again, you're not allowed to talk about that now. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1645.68s)]
*  It's also, to bring back the chest analogy, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1648.3200000000002s)]
*  if you looked at war and you ignored the human casualties [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1651.3600000000001s)]
*  and the horrors and the fact that it should absolutely [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1657.44s)]
*  be avoided at all costs, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1659.64s)]
*  and all human deaths are valuable [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1661.0800000000002s)]
*  and bombing apartment buildings and all that horrible shit, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1663.3600000000001s)]
*  it's terrible and evil. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1666.0s)]
*  But this isn't like that we are being fed a narrative [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1668.28s)]
*  that Russia made a big move and there was no other moves. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1672.44s)]
*  And when we find out about the moving of weapons [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1676.6000000000001s)]
*  closer to Russia, the discussion of them joining NATO, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1680.56s)]
*  and you realize Russia is getting moved on, there's moves. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1684.56s)]
*  Now, you absolutely be correct in saying [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1689.04s)]
*  the correct response is not blowing up apartment buildings [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1692.3600000000001s)]
*  and starting a war and invading a country, you're right. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1694.64s)]
*  But this is not an unprovoked situation. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1698.04s)]
*  It would just come out of nowhere from a madman. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1700.8s)]
*  We're not getting this narrative on television. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1702.92s)]
*  This is a new time. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1706.12s)]
*  And the only way to get this discussion is you guys. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1707.76s)]
*  It's people like you. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1711.32s)]
*  And that's what's so fucking important about today. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1712.8s)]
*  And that's what's so dangerous about censorship. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1716.32s)]
*  And that's what's so dangerous about these partisan ideas [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1718.8799999999999s)]
*  where you're willing to absolutely ignore good points [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1722.24s)]
*  that the other side says, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1727.64s)]
*  because then you would give them some sort of credit [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1729.16s)]
*  in winning this ideological bullshit game we're all playing. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1731.3200000000002s)]
*  That is so well said. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1734.8000000000002s)]
*  It drives me nuts, especially on corruption. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1735.72s)]
*  You were talking about censorship, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1738.28s)]
*  but corruption is a great one [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1739.3600000000001s)]
*  where everybody wants to talk about Hunter Biden [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1740.6000000000001s)]
*  on the right. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1742.44s)]
*  I would love, listen, we can talk about Hunter Biden all day. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1743.28s)]
*  We've been covering it since day one. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1745.0800000000002s)]
*  He's a guy who got hooked on drugs. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1747.28s)]
*  Right, yes. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1749.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1750.6000000000001s)]
*  He loves to get his dick sucked. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1751.44s)]
*  Yeah, and who doesn't? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1752.76s)]
*  That's not what the problem is. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1754.6000000000001s)]
*  It's just revealing a very corrupt system [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1757.5600000000002s)]
*  that everyone wants to ignore. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1761.48s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1763.0s)]
*  And then we were like, hey, let's talk about Jared Kushner. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1763.8400000000001s)]
*  And then a lot of people on the writers. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1765.76s)]
*  I'm like, hey, this guy, it's actually great. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1767.16s)]
*  There are internal Saudi documents [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1770.0800000000002s)]
*  where he asked the Saudi Royal Kingdom fund or whatever [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1771.96s)]
*  for a billion dollar investment in his new fund, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1775.88s)]
*  private equity fund, right after he leaves the White House. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1778.76s)]
*  The internal emails are like, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1780.72s)]
*  I don't think this guy's a very good investor. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1781.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure this would be a good use of our capital. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1784.0800000000002s)]
*  And MBS, the Crown Prince is like, give him the money. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1786.32s)]
*  They're like, send him the billion. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1788.56s)]
*  He intervenes personally to get Jared his two billion. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1790.84s)]
*  I think it was two. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1794.68s)]
*  Maybe two billion. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1795.52s)]
*  Two billion for his fund. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1796.36s)]
*  That's a baller friend to have. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1797.56s)]
*  Yeah, but if you're on the right, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1799.0s)]
*  let's not talk about that. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1801.08s)]
*  Let's talk about Hunter Biden and his laptop. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1802.08s)]
*  And of course the Democrats, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1804.0s)]
*  we had Ted Lieu, congressman on. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1804.8799999999999s)]
*  This is back in the old days at the Hill at Rising, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1807.0s)]
*  but I'll never forget. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1809.2s)]
*  We were pressing him on Hunter Biden, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1810.12s)]
*  these boards that he was on, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1812.32s)]
*  and the money he was getting, whatever. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1813.44s)]
*  People sit on boards and they get paid money. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1815.2800000000002s)]
*  It was so part of the Washington, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1817.76s)]
*  the water that they swim in, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1820.92s)]
*  he couldn't even conceive that it was a problem. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1823.0s)]
*  I mean, now it may not be illegal, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1825.76s)]
*  but that's an issue in and of itself. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1828.16s)]
*  The fact that he could just hand wave away. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1830.52s)]
*  Well, it's semi-legal. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1833.2s)]
*  No, it's just straight legal. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1835.48s)]
*  That's the crazy part. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1836.3200000000002s)]
*  It's sketchy. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1838.44s)]
*  It's legal, but it's sketchy. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1839.2800000000002s)]
*  But to your point about censorship [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1841.8400000000001s)]
*  and the total lack of willingness [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1845.08s)]
*  to challenge your own side's narrative, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1846.32s)]
*  did you just see this Columbia Journalism Review report [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1848.32s)]
*  that came out about Russiagate? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1851.32s)]
*  Sagar and I were looking at it. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1852.72s)]
*  Oh, it's fantastic. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1853.56s)]
*  It's really long in depth. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1854.52s)]
*  I mean, it's overdue, right? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1856.4s)]
*  It's like way after the fact. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1857.48s)]
*  But I think this is one of the first, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1859.16s)]
*  certainly mainstream, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1861.92s)]
*  and CJR is as mainstream as they come, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1863.52s)]
*  mainstream attempts to actually go back through [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1866.08s)]
*  the Russiagate narrative, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1869.2s)]
*  where it started, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1870.8s)]
*  how it was sold to the American people, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1871.96s)]
*  and all of the lies, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1873.72s)]
*  and especially the omissions. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1875.48s)]
*  And they take a really hard look at the New York Times [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1877.68s)]
*  as kind of the main player in the story. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1880.52s)]
*  There were other villains as well, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1881.92s)]
*  but the New York Times was the main player. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1883.04s)]
*  And they would report something [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1884.96s)]
*  that they would shade it to look as bad as possible [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1887.76s)]
*  with regards to Trump-Russia connections. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1890.92s)]
*  They would get some other piece of information [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1892.88s)]
*  that was exculpatory, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1894.64s)]
*  wouldn't be in the paper at all. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1896.24s)]
*  And they got all kinds, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1898.0s)]
*  millions of new subscribers to their paper [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1899.56s)]
*  who were there to hear this elaborate tale [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1902.2s)]
*  of Russian conspiracy, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1905.96s)]
*  and the Manchurian canon, and whatever. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1907.8000000000002s)]
*  And the underlying narrative that at least I take away [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1910.1200000000001s)]
*  from the CJR report is the New York Times, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1913.24s)]
*  and Namaste NBC, and a lot of other places. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1915.3200000000002s)]
*  They were more interested in feeding that audience [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1917.5600000000002s)]
*  what they wanted to hear [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1920.28s)]
*  than actually looking at the facts of what was happening. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1921.8000000000002s)]
*  And you read it, it is as damning as it could be. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1924.72s)]
*  And listen, the way we were sold, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1928.0800000000002s)]
*  the Iraq War was bad enough, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1930.52s)]
*  that was a travesty. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1933.0s)]
*  After the fact, they actually did some correctives [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1933.84s)]
*  that here's what we got wrong, and we're sorry, whatever. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1935.8799999999999s)]
*  This, they will never admit [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1938.24s)]
*  that they did anything wrong here. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1940.8799999999999s)]
*  They just move forward and pretend [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1942.9199999999998s)]
*  none of it ever happened. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1944.84s)]
*  And it is astonishing. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1945.8799999999999s)]
*  Then they turn around and wonder, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1947.72s)]
*  why does no one trust us? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1948.76s)]
*  We just don't get it. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1949.76s)]
*  Yeah, well, we have to make laws against disinformation. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1950.6s)]
*  That's what we have to do. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1954.1999999999998s)]
*  Misinformation, malinformation, all of those are bad. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1955.8s)]
*  And this way, we can control the narrative. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1959.4399999999998s)]
*  Are you gonna be the one who determines [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1962.0s)]
*  what's fact and what's fiction? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1964.24s)]
*  And actually in the piece, they were like, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1965.68s)]
*  the US has the lowest media trust in 42 developed nations. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1967.0s)]
*  They're like, yeah, how does that fucking happen? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1971.4s)]
*  I don't think that's true, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1972.24s)]
*  because I think there's an insanely strong trust [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1973.2s)]
*  in independent media. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1976.44s)]
*  You are right, they're pointing to the mainstream media. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1977.28s)]
*  These people that are, they're just who they are. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1979.96s)]
*  You know who they are. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1983.88s)]
*  And it's possible to do now. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1985.3600000000001s)]
*  You can be a real person. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1987.76s)]
*  You don't have to be a propagandist [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1989.56s)]
*  or a spokesperson for the state. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1991.28s)]
*  You can be a real person [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1993.04s)]
*  and tell people what the fuck is going on. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1994.36s)]
*  Because this is a wild game [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1996.8s)]
*  that other people are playing on our behalf [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=1998.72s)]
*  with money that they've gotten from our taxes, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2000.96s)]
*  what we don't even get to say, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2003.32s)]
*  and what the fuck they spend it on. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2004.44s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2005.72s)]
*  It's crazy and it doesn't affect your daily life. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2007.56s)]
*  You drive to the same place, you say hi to your neighbors. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2011.4s)]
*  It seems fine, but you're dealing with [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2014.08s)]
*  a fucking destructive empire [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2016.4s)]
*  that has been doing things to other countries. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2019.7199999999998s)]
*  That if you saw them, if you were boots on the ground, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2021.6399999999999s)]
*  you would be horrified if you watched a drone [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2024.2399999999998s)]
*  bomb a wedding party in Yemen. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2028.6s)]
*  If you were a part of something in another country [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2031.08s)]
*  that we're involved in, that our tax dollars have gone to, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2034.32s)]
*  that we have just written off as being not of concern. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2036.9199999999998s)]
*  Right, right. Which is crazy. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2040.4399999999998s)]
*  Yemen is a great example. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2042.4799999999998s)]
*  I mean, across the board, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2044.0s)]
*  humanitarian organizations around the world say [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2045.9599999999998s)]
*  this is the greatest humanitarian crisis [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2048.24s)]
*  that is unfolding in the entire world. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2050.3999999999996s)]
*  And we are highly complicit in this [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2052.3999999999996s)]
*  through our support of Saudi Arabia. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2054.64s)]
*  You don't see Yemen flags on people's cars. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2057.24s)]
*  You don't see the news media talking about it. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2060.3599999999997s)]
*  You don't see them humanizing the children [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2062.3199999999997s)]
*  that are starving and dying there. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2064.7599999999998s)]
*  And so part of the way that the information ecosystem [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2067.08s)]
*  is shaped is what they decide to care about, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2071.8799999999997s)]
*  what they decide to cover, the way they decide to cover it, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2074.68s)]
*  and what just gets pushed off the page [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2077.92s)]
*  entirely out of sight, out of mind. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2079.6800000000003s)]
*  I think there's an important part to talk about with this [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2081.6s)]
*  that with human beings, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2084.92s)]
*  when human beings work inside corporate systems [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2087.6s)]
*  and these systems have goals and they're trying, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2091.32s)]
*  everyone's working together and there's a hierarchy of people [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2094.36s)]
*  and you're not allowed to step out of line, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2097.6800000000003s)]
*  we develop a way of thinking that is almost like, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2099.92s)]
*  it's a tribal way and it's kind of a religious way. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2103.84s)]
*  I'm curious to know how you guys feel about your ability [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2108.08s)]
*  to be completely independent outside of that [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2112.16s)]
*  and how that's affected the way you think about things. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2114.04s)]
*  Because for me personally, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2116.92s)]
*  having all these conversations with so many different people [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2119.8s)]
*  about so many different subjects, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2123.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm a different person. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2125.04s)]
*  I'm a completely different person. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2126.96s)]
*  It's shaped me so, it's like the most bombarding, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2128.68s)]
*  overwhelming education that it's very difficult to process, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2133.4s)]
*  but if you're in a corporate environment, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2138.2400000000002s)]
*  it's very hard to think independently. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2142.5600000000004s)]
*  It really is. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2145.8s)]
*  You don't have the time, you don't have the notion, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2146.6400000000003s)]
*  you definitely don't benefit from it. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2148.96s)]
*  You don't have the incentive. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2151.0800000000004s)]
*  That's the big one. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2152.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, if you speak out, you're fucking penalized. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2153.0400000000004s)]
*  You can lose your job. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2154.84s)]
*  Just things that aren't even out of line. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2156.2400000000002s)]
*  I remember there was a hockey guy, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2159.28s)]
*  he was a hockey commentator, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2161.2000000000003s)]
*  and he said that all lives matter and he got fired. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2163.28s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2166.2799999999997s)]
*  It's like, what an egregious misstep. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2169.12s)]
*  All lives matter. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2172.4799999999996s)]
*  You know I got my start in media on MSNBC. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2173.4799999999996s)]
*  Yes, I know. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2176.12s)]
*  So, I mean, am I a different person from those days? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2176.9599999999996s)]
*  God, I certainly am. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2179.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I wanted to bring it up to you guys. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2180.56s)]
*  I go back and look at it. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2182.12s)]
*  And some of it I watch and I'm proud of. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2183.8399999999997s)]
*  I did, I focused on a lot of the same issues. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2186.64s)]
*  I do labor and economic inequality, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2189.24s)]
*  economics, things that I really care a lot about, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2191.68s)]
*  especially on foreign policy though. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2194.2799999999997s)]
*  Some of that stuff I go back and watch [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2196.52s)]
*  and I'm like, oh my God, this is so cringe. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2197.6800000000003s)]
*  And I just bought into the corporate lie. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2199.96s)]
*  Now, ultimately, shortly before I was let go, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2203.6s)]
*  I did a monologue when Hillary Clinton was building up [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2207.28s)]
*  to run for president. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2210.12s)]
*  It was back in 2014. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2211.6s)]
*  So this was early on. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2213.48s)]
*  And I did this whole thing that was like, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2214.8s)]
*  she's sold out to Wall Street, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2216.96s)]
*  people are gonna hate this lady, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2218.32s)]
*  she's like the terrible candidate for the moment, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2219.88s)]
*  please don't run. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2221.88s)]
*  And I was allowed to say it, right? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2223.6s)]
*  I delivered my thing. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2226.8399999999997s)]
*  I did it exactly how I wanted to do it. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2227.96s)]
*  Afterwards, I get pulled into an office and great, Molly, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2230.36s)]
*  everything's fine. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2234.4s)]
*  But next time you do any commentary on Hillary Clinton, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2235.68s)]
*  it has to get approved by the president of the network. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2239.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2243.3199999999997s)]
*  And think about, I mean, I would love to say that I, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2244.2799999999997s)]
*  I did further Hillary Clinton commentary. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2247.7999999999997s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2250.2s)]
*  But I would love to say that didn't affect me. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2251.3199999999997s)]
*  And I was just there to be a truth teller. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2253.16s)]
*  But listen, I'm a human being. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2254.52s)]
*  I'm sure I responded to the incentives of that system [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2256.36s)]
*  of like, I don't wanna get in trouble with the boss. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2258.68s)]
*  For sure. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2260.64s)]
*  And that's, so that's the way that it works. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2261.48s)]
*  People, that's a very blatant example, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2264.12s)]
*  but oftentimes people know where the boundaries are. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2266.6s)]
*  They know what they're allowed to say. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2270.44s)]
*  And so they don't need that direct intervention [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2272.12s)]
*  of censorship. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2275.0s)]
*  And also by the way, these people, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2275.84s)]
*  most of them in cable news, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2277.92s)]
*  they're not really there because they're talented. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2280.16s)]
*  They're there because they're reliable purveyors [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2281.88s)]
*  of whatever it is that that network wants to purvey. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2284.28s)]
*  So that's ultimately why they get the job [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2287.08s)]
*  and they understand the parameters of the task. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2289.44s)]
*  Well, there's just a thing that happens [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2291.76s)]
*  when you're connected with someone. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2294.28s)]
*  If you're connected financially, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2296.1600000000003s)]
*  if you're connected in a friendship way, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2297.92s)]
*  that's why cronyism works. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2300.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2303.48s)]
*  That's a good point. Absolutely. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2304.32s)]
*  They easel their way in. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2305.1600000000003s)]
*  And look, I can give you examples of it in my own life. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2306.1600000000003s)]
*  Like if anybody ever comes to me [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2309.28s)]
*  with any kind of criticism of Dana White, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2312.6400000000003s)]
*  and I'm like, you're going to the wrong guy. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2314.6000000000004s)]
*  Like that guy's my brother. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2316.6000000000004s)]
*  I'll never say a bad thing about him. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2319.8s)]
*  If I didn't know him, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2321.8s)]
*  if he was some asshole that lived in some other country, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2323.32s)]
*  I would probably talk shit about him like that, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2326.4s)]
*  talk shit about everything. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2328.44s)]
*  But I love that guy to death [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2329.6400000000003s)]
*  and I'll never say a bad word about him. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2330.8s)]
*  So it's like, if you're coming to me [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2332.4s)]
*  for objective journalism about one of my friends, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2335.1200000000003s)]
*  you got the wrong person. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2337.88s)]
*  Yeah, but you're open about it, right? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2339.6800000000003s)]
*  Yes. That's the most important part. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2340.56s)]
*  We got the wrong person. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2342.12s)]
*  But I won't say any, I won't lie, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2343.4s)]
*  but I won't ever say anything negative about my friends. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2346.56s)]
*  It's just like, I don't think that's necessary. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2349.28s)]
*  And that's something that happens [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2351.6s)]
*  when you get a shit ton of money involved [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2353.4s)]
*  and you get relationships [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2355.7599999999998s)]
*  and you're drinking scotch together at a private club [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2357.16s)]
*  and you're discussing the advertising revenue. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2359.72s)]
*  And we'd like to donate a bunch of money to CNN. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2362.12s)]
*  We'd like to figure out a way that we can work together. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2365.8s)]
*  Hey, I'm a fucking captain billionaire [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2369.08s)]
*  and I want to donate all this money [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2371.8799999999997s)]
*  to all these people that own media organizations. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2374.12s)]
*  And I'd like to be your friend. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2377.16s)]
*  That's it. That's fine. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2381.3999999999996s)]
*  I'd like to be your friend. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2382.24s)]
*  It's cool, right? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2383.08s)]
*  Who doesn't want to go to fun parties? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2383.9199999999996s)]
*  It's just friends, we're friends. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2385.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's all part of a system. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2386.72s)]
*  We go fishing. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2388.3199999999997s)]
*  This is the other thing, actually, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2389.3599999999997s)]
*  I was hoping to bring up is, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2390.64s)]
*  I don't think people understand [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2392.2s)]
*  that cable is a fake business model. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2393.3999999999996s)]
*  So for example, we talk a lot about the failing ratings, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2395.2s)]
*  the key demo numbers on all three of these channels [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2398.12s)]
*  is a joke. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2400.6s)]
*  I always like to say, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2401.64s)]
*  Chris and I would be starving in a ditch [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2403.2s)]
*  if we were getting the same numbers as these people. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2405.0s)]
*  So how do they survive? [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2407.88s)]
*  It's because they're part of something called [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2409.7599999999998s)]
*  the cable bundle. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2411.3199999999997s)]
*  And so when you buy cable, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2412.36s)]
*  like Cox Communications or whatever, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2414.6s)]
*  they pay, Comcast, for example, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2416.52s)]
*  they pay CNN and MSNBC and Fox to be a part of the bundle. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2418.72s)]
*  The vast majority of the profit of these cable channels [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2423.04s)]
*  comes from the bundle. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2425.88s)]
*  So CNN made a billion in profit just last year, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2427.28s)]
*  all propped up by the bundle [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2431.2000000000003s)]
*  because they're getting paid just to exist. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2433.8s)]
*  I mean, can you imagine if we were getting paid to exist, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2435.6000000000004s)]
*  not based upon our actual numbers? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2438.0800000000004s)]
*  Like you can actually reach less people and make more money. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2440.48s)]
*  And so it's all part of this fake system. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2443.96s)]
*  But I mean, the benefit is, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2446.48s)]
*  is that with the rise of independent media, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2448.1200000000003s)]
*  more and more advertisers are waking up, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2450.0800000000004s)]
*  the less eyeballs, the less of an incentive for the bundle [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2451.96s)]
*  to actually pay them to be a part of it. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2454.48s)]
*  And that's why I was actually really excited by Amazon [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2456.4s)]
*  striking that deal with the NFL, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2458.92s)]
*  because I'm like, yes, get the rights away from these people [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2460.1600000000003s)]
*  because that is what props up all kinds of bullshit [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2463.56s)]
*  that we don't have like a small D democratic input [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2466.84s)]
*  with our eyeballs on CNN or any of these places. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2469.6s)]
*  They can exist just fine without us. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2472.7200000000003s)]
*  Like to truly kill them, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2475.12s)]
*  we have to get away from live news on TV. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2476.64s)]
*  That's the number one thing still propping them up today. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2478.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2481.76s)]
*  It's kind of a zombie business model. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2482.6s)]
*  But I will tell you, I mean, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2484.32s)]
*  I have a lot of optimism, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2486.92s)]
*  certainly about what we're doing, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2489.12s)]
*  about the response to what we're doing, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2490.64s)]
*  about the independent media ecosystem. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2492.64s)]
*  But we were, you and I were talking the other day, Joe, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2494.8799999999997s)]
*  about I do think it's a dangerous moment for people. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2497.7999999999997s)]
*  And one thing we've been covering a lot on the show is [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2502.64s)]
*  you have a kind of breakdown [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2506.64s)]
*  in previous national stories and narratives. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2508.48s)]
*  And people are very like story driven. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2511.3199999999997s)]
*  You have a breakdown in, I'm not a religious person, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2513.52s)]
*  so this is like not my bag, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2516.6s)]
*  but you have a breakdown in religion. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2517.44s)]
*  So some of the stories that have kind of like [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2518.44s)]
*  held the country together and that people helped use [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2520.28s)]
*  to make sense of their life, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2523.0s)]
*  or even the story about the American dream. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2524.12s)]
*  A lot of these things are kind of breaking down. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2527.2000000000003s)]
*  Now that's a good thing because it creates a possibility [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2529.7200000000003s)]
*  for a new, more beneficial story. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2533.28s)]
*  But in the meantime, it is just a like heyday [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2536.08s)]
*  for con artists and charlatans and people [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2540.0s)]
*  who are willing to sell a narrative [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2543.88s)]
*  to a lot of folks who feel kind of lost, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2547.36s)]
*  kind of adrift, and don't like existing in that chaos. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2550.1600000000003s)]
*  So it's like whether they're being scammed by like SBF [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2553.6400000000003s)]
*  or this like Congressman George Santos [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2557.84s)]
*  who like made up every aspect of his life. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2560.36s)]
*  That guy's amazing. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2563.0s)]
*  Crystal's obsessed with him, I just find him a disgrace. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2564.92s)]
*  Do you see some pictures of him [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2566.84s)]
*  when he's a drag queen in Brazil? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2567.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, Katara, absolutely. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2569.6s)]
*  I think that- [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2572.1200000000003s)]
*  Drag-ish. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2573.1200000000003s)]
*  Now you can't criticize him anymore, he's trans. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2573.96s)]
*  So the part I'm obsessed with him is first of all, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2576.36s)]
*  I just can't imagine being that person who can like, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2581.44s)]
*  and whoever he was across from, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2586.52s)]
*  he was gonna tell them what they wanted to hear. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2588.5600000000004s)]
*  When the dude was like, I'm into volleyball, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2590.76s)]
*  he's like, I was a star volleyball player [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2593.0800000000004s)]
*  at a college he didn't even go to. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2595.36s)]
*  I have a very good friend who texted me today [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2596.2000000000003s)]
*  and he told me, I'm here with this guy [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2599.56s)]
*  who knew you from Boston and this and that and that and this [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2601.6s)]
*  and I say, what's his name? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2605.0s)]
*  He tells me the name, I go, that guy's full of shit, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2607.56s)]
*  I don't know that guy. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2609.52s)]
*  And so then he tells me that he took a picture [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2610.8s)]
*  with this guy and the guy pretended [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2614.04s)]
*  that he was texting it to me. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2615.96s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2619.2s)]
*  These are real people. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2620.32s)]
*  See, and that's- [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2621.16s)]
*  These are real people that are just crazy. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2622.48s)]
*  And that's the thing that is I'm like, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2624.2s)]
*  how many of these people are out there, number one. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2625.92s)]
*  And number two, I just feel like his ability to rise [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2628.12s)]
*  and make it to Congress says so much about the crack [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2632.52s)]
*  through the holes. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2636.2400000000002s)]
*  Look at them, FTX execs maxed out our donations. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2637.08s)]
*  I didn't even know that. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2639.84s)]
*  Of course they did. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2640.68s)]
*  Of course they did, look at them. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2642.52s)]
*  That right there is the perfect news story for our era. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2644.52s)]
*  Look at that American flag fucking pin on the lapel, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2647.52s)]
*  I love it, I love it. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2650.12s)]
*  This is America's congressman right here. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2650.96s)]
*  Your question is what is his name? [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2652.36s)]
*  It's America's congressman. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2653.2s)]
*  Have you seen the video where he's like, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2654.04s)]
*  hi, my name is Anthony DeValdir? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2654.86s)]
*  Yeah, and he changes his name. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2656.2s)]
*  Who the fuck are you? [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2657.04s)]
*  Full on con man. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2658.78s)]
*  Full on con man. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2659.6200000000003s)]
*  There's so few people that wanna be congressmen. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2660.46s)]
*  There's so few people that wanna get involved [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2663.98s)]
*  that you could be a fucking loon, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2666.2200000000003s)]
*  a fucking loon with all the right bullet points [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2669.38s)]
*  and you can get all the way in. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2672.34s)]
*  Well, he told people what they wanted to hear. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2673.82s)]
*  To the donors, he was like, I'm a wealthy businessman, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2677.1s)]
*  I'm highly successful, I worked at Goldman Sachs, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2680.48s)]
*  all this stuff, they're like, oh, this is our kinda guy. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2682.86s)]
*  To the electorate and the Republican, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2685.04s)]
*  he pitched that he's like this trailblazing, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2686.62s)]
*  I am the American dream, Latino, gay, all this stuff. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2689.94s)]
*  It really was incredible, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2694.2599999999998s)]
*  the way that he told people what they wanted to hear. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2696.64s)]
*  That's a part that I'm really interested and obsessed with [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2699.06s)]
*  because all of these people are like a reflection [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2702.1s)]
*  of the holes and vulnerabilities in society. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2704.2999999999997s)]
*  Same thing with Sam Bankman Fried and FTX. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2707.22s)]
*  He told people in congress, he told the media, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2709.58s)]
*  he had this very specific cultivated image [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2714.46s)]
*  of his wacky hair and his dressed down look and whatever, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2717.3s)]
*  that he was the eccentric genius or whatever. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2720.38s)]
*  And a lot of people who were supposed to be super smart [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2722.58s)]
*  in the business press and in the regular press [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2726.5s)]
*  and on Capitol Hill, they all bought it hook, line and sinker. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2729.46s)]
*  After Bernie Wanoff, you're not gonna fool us again. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2734.26s)]
*  Oh yeah, right. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2737.1800000000003s)]
*  We've got it all, we figured it out. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2738.7400000000002s)]
*  We got it down. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2740.94s)]
*  It's not like Theranos was like five years ago. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2741.78s)]
*  Theranos was in an abnormality, sir. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2744.8199999999997s)]
*  Never happened again. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2748.02s)]
*  People like that are rare and they don't really get through. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2748.94s)]
*  It's actually a good thing though, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2752.98s)]
*  just to show people these people aren't that smart. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2754.14s)]
*  When I first came to DC, you get to the White House [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2756.22s)]
*  and you're like, holy shit, this is the White House. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2759.06s)]
*  I remember when I met Trump and interviewing him [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2760.9s)]
*  in the Oval Office and I'm like, holy shit, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2763.42s)]
*  I'm in the Oval, that's JFK who's there, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2765.62s)]
*  this is where Nixon did this thing. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2767.8599999999997s)]
*  But then some guy comes in with his shoes off [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2769.8199999999997s)]
*  and you're like, oh, this is just an office. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2773.02s)]
*  It's just a normal building. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2775.66s)]
*  And so you gotta take that veneer off. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2776.94s)]
*  Most people actually get this, I'm probably just weird, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2778.66s)]
*  which is these people aren't that smart. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2780.58s)]
*  They're the billionaires and they're actually fools. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2782.18s)]
*  Sam Bankman Fried raised a billion dollars [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2784.58s)]
*  and he was literally playing Counter-Strike [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2786.34s)]
*  while he was on a Zoom call. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2788.06s)]
*  And he was playing a video game, he said some bullshit [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2790.1s)]
*  and something about a banana and they gave him [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2793.18s)]
*  a billion dollars and this is one of the top tier [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2795.38s)]
*  venture capital firms in the world. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2798.02s)]
*  These are supposed to be the most sophisticated investors [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2800.66s)]
*  and just totally bamboozled by this guy. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2805.1s)]
*  On the other end, a lot of people who bought into [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2810.7s)]
*  what he was selling or what NFTs that were being sold [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2814.62s)]
*  or whatever random crypto scams were out there, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2817.94s)]
*  they had their own vulnerabilities of maybe they were hurt [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2822.58s)]
*  in the financial crash, maybe they feel like [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2825.38s)]
*  it was disproportionately young men. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2827.98s)]
*  So maybe they feel like the American dream of getting [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2830.6600000000003s)]
*  the house and having the family and the basic [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2833.1400000000003s)]
*  middle class prosperity wasn't really open to them [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2838.1400000000003s)]
*  and they're being sold this sort of hero journey narrative [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2841.34s)]
*  about fortune favors the brave and you gotta get in early [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2844.7400000000002s)]

*  He's like what we are talking about though is in the last [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2887.02s)]
*  two decades we've had a crisis amongst young men [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2889.3399999999997s)]
*  and something we talk about on the show is what Crystal's [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2892.18s)]
*  getting at with the decline of the American dream, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2894.4599999999996s)]
*  like the idea that you are gonna do better than your parents [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2896.7s)]
*  and that's just not really true anymore. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2900.14s)]
*  Even if you went to school and you have a shit ton [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2902.5s)]
*  of student debt, even if you're working class in terms [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2904.74s)]
*  of wage growth, upward mobility, people who are graduating [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2906.8999999999996s)]
*  from high school who are men and working class [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2911.46s)]
*  having much more trouble actually finding a mate. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2914.7400000000002s)]
*  So there's a big college imbalance right now where a lot [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2917.7s)]
*  of men are dropping out of college, they no longer feel [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2920.62s)]
*  accepted and you're reaching almost 60, 40 splits of women [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2923.3s)]
*  and men in college, especially who are graduating. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2926.86s)]
*  A lot of women who have college degrees don't actually [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2929.46s)]
*  wanna date somebody who doesn't have a college degree [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2931.5s)]
*  and so there's this big imbalance in the dating market [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2934.02s)]
*  and then also amongst single men you see a big decline [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2936.86s)]
*  in lifetime wages but what really makes me really sad [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2940.82s)]
*  is the drug overdose numbers and they die much earlier. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2944.5800000000004s)]
*  They're much less likely to exercise, much less likely [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2948.1000000000004s)]
*  to fulfill a more like a stronger life and that's what gets [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2950.6200000000003s)]
*  to the charlatanism of like being able to buy [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2953.9s)]
*  into the charlatan, signing up for some MLN scheme [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2956.6600000000003s)]
*  that you might see online, buying crypto. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2959.7400000000002s)]
*  By the way, you're looking at a crypto victim, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2963.1800000000003s)]
*  I lost $5,000 on BlockFi, got fucked out by that. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2964.5800000000004s)]
*  There's a lot of men that feel by their very existence [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2969.58s)]
*  that they're bad. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2972.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's a big cultural problem. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2973.9s)]
*  They're fed this thought of toxic masculinity [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2976.1s)]
*  and the things that they're attracted to, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2978.02s)]
*  they think they've been told they're stupid [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2979.42s)]
*  or that they're evil or there's a thing about being a man [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2982.1s)]
*  in this world today that I think we have to look at all [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2987.94s)]
*  human beings as just human beings and you can't help [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2991.7799999999997s)]
*  that you were born a man and you can't help the things [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2995.98s)]
*  that you enjoy, like if you enjoy going to football games, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=2998.42s)]
*  you enjoy getting loud with your friends. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3001.66s)]
*  This idea of toxic masculinity, it's like, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3004.26s)]
*  yeah, there's toxic aspects of men and that's real, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3007.62s)]
*  that's a reality of being a male human being. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3011.5s)]
*  If you look at the history of war, it's all started by men. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3014.02s)]
*  Men did all of it, men do all the raping. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3017.26s)]
*  I had this guy on the podcast once, it was hilarious. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3020.1800000000003s)]
*  He goes, actually, statistically speaking, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3022.54s)]
*  men get raped more than women do. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3025.46s)]
*  I go, yeah, by other men, you fucking idiot. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3027.58s)]
*  I go, it's not packs of cheerleaders raping football players. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3030.82s)]
*  The fuck is wrong with you? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3034.66s)]
*  The problem is 100% men. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3037.3s)]
*  That's the problem with manosphere is that there's grifters [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3039.22s)]
*  in the manosphere that aren't actual real men. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3042.02s)]
*  And by real men, I mean, they don't have resolve. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3045.34s)]
*  If you took them on a hike, they would get tired. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3048.5s)]
*  They would sit down, you would have to leave them behind. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3051.06s)]
*  The word tough is a word, but it's like, oh, you're tough. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3054.98s)]
*  No, mental toughness is fucking important. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3059.7s)]
*  It's a really important quality of life [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3062.18s)]
*  and it's been diminished to this thing [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3064.42s)]
*  that's a part of toxic masculinity ideology. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3066.22s)]
*  Well, and this is where the Andrew Tates of the world [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3070.38s)]
*  come in and they perform this just caricature-ish, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3072.82s)]
*  ridiculous, masculine whatever they're doing [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3076.66s)]
*  and then also maybe as a sex trafficker, we'll find out, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3079.86s)]
*  we'll see what happens there, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3082.98s)]
*  but it again speaks to the fact [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3084.38s)]
*  there used to be a really clear sort of cultural narrative [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3087.1s)]
*  right or wrong about what it was to be a man. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3090.26s)]
*  And at the core of that was being a provider, right? [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3092.5s)]
*  For women, it was like, you know, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3095.06s)]
*  it was other things being like a mother and a nurturer [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3096.26s)]
*  and like the way you look. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3098.18s)]
*  For men, it's like about the wallet, right? [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3099.18s)]
*  The pocketbook. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3100.94s)]
*  And then, so I think when we've had an assault [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3101.78s)]
*  on the middle class, on the working class [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3105.62s)]
*  where it becomes so much harder [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3108.46s)]
*  to be able to fulfill that cultural narrative [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3111.82s)]
*  of what it is supposed to be to be a man. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3114.82s)]
*  I think that's been, this is as a woman, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3118.3s)]
*  but you know, from my external perspective, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3120.6200000000003s)]
*  I think that's been really, really devastating. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3122.78s)]
*  And I don't wanna pretend also though, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3125.06s)]
*  like it's like only young men [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3126.86s)]
*  who are getting scammed right now. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3128.1800000000003s)]
*  Everybody has their own. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3129.9s)]
*  There's, sorry, what was the name? [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3131.38s)]
*  Lula Rowe. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3133.7400000000002s)]
*  And there's a great series about this MLM [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3135.1000000000004s)]
*  scheme of these fucking ugly leggings [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3140.54s)]
*  that a bunch of Midwestern housewives [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3144.5s)]
*  for some reason love these things. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3149.14s)]
*  There they are, that's it. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3151.46s)]
*  Okay, they are hideous. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3152.86s)]
*  You and I are on the wrong page here [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3154.94s)]

*  from another Mormon lady? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3166.1s)]
*  100%. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3167.46s)]

*  I'm a non-criticizer of my wife's behavior. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3173.42s)]
*  That's a good idea. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3176.02s)]

*  You're gonna be able to have it all. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3197.5s)]
*  But then as the thing went on, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3199.18s)]
*  and originally there was like a real demand [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3201.06s)]
*  for these leggings and people really did want them. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3202.82s)]
*  So you felt like, oh, I'm doing the thing. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3204.22s)]
*  But then as time goes on, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3206.02s)]
*  the only people who are making money [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3207.58s)]
*  are the people who are convincing more [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3209.3s)]
*  to get into the legging sales business. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3211.3s)]
*  And it's a classic, basically pyramid scheme. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3214.86s)]
*  And over time, the quality of the leggings degrade. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3218.5s)]
*  They're sending out packages that like smell bad [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3220.54s)]
*  and they're ripped and whatever. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3222.54s)]
*  But the bottom line is the only way to make money [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3223.58s)]
*  was by bringing in more people after you, [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3226.14s)]
*  which is definitely an MMLM. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3227.8199999999997s)]
*  But that was the like, [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3229.22s)]
*  for the Midwestern housewife or whatever. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3231.9s)]
*  Maybe they just have a marketing problem [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3233.5s)]
*  because someone should tell them how fly those leggings are [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3236.14s)]
*  and they can fly it off the shelf. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3238.5s)]
*  You're gonna get contacted. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3239.3399999999997s)]
*  You made that fucking guy's day. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3240.18s)]
*  You're gonna get contacted. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3242.14s)]
*  Next thing you know, we're gonna listen to Joe's podcast [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3243.3399999999997s)]
*  and he's like, this is brought to you by Lula Rowe. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3245.42s)]
*  Have some like little Minnie mouses on them. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3248.3799999999997s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3250.62s)]
*  That's all right. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3251.46s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3252.2999999999997s)]
*  But I think it's also a broader cultural thing [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3253.14s)]
*  where being in the mainstream, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3255.26s)]
*  mainstream masculinity is not really represented. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3257.7400000000002s)]
*  And because of that, that also opens a space [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3260.46s)]
*  for a lot of grifters. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3263.3s)]
*  I mean, I was looking at that with the whole liver King thing [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3264.7000000000003s)]
*  which I know you covered quite a bit, but I saw something. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3267.34s)]
*  Well, I called it. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3270.9s)]
*  I didn't cover it. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3272.1000000000004s)]
*  Oh, did you? [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3272.94s)]
*  Yeah, I called it way in advance. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3273.76s)]
*  I'm like, that guy's on the sauce. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3275.2200000000003s)]
*  Just from the looking at him? [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3276.5800000000004s)]
*  100%. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3277.7000000000003s)]
*  So you just don't naturally get that way. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3279.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you can naturally get that way [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3282.1400000000003s)]
*  if you have superior genetics and you're in your 20s. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3284.62s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3288.7799999999997s)]
*  Like if you're in your 20s, the sin is 40s. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3289.8199999999997s)]
*  He's like 45, yeah. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3291.8199999999997s)]
*  He's carrying around too much mass. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3293.54s)]
*  Like you would have to be, by the way, in your 20s, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3295.42s)]
*  your hormones are flying. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3299.3399999999997s)]
*  If you're like 21, 22 years old, [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3301.5s)]
*  there's some natural guys that I follow that are fucking [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3303.18s)]
*  jacked, but it's a different kind of jacked. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3306.38s)]
*  That guy's a juiced up jacked and it's hard. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3309.22s)]
*  I think something's going on with his abs too. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3312.1s)]
*  Oh yeah, the surgery, you think that's real? [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3314.1s)]
*  I don't know, but anyone who's willing to lie [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3316.9s)]
*  about doing steroids when it's so obvious [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3319.7400000000002s)]
*  to anyone who understands hormonal optimization [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3321.7400000000002s)]
*  and steroid use and that more plates, more dates guy, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3325.78s)]
*  Derek, I love that guy. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3328.94s)]
*  You know, he called it, we both called it way in advance. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3331.06s)]
*  Like there's not a chance in hell, there's no way. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3333.82s)]
*  It's like if you look at Mr. Olympia, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3336.2200000000003s)]
*  no one thinks they don't take steroids. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3339.02s)]
*  Zero people and you would be correct. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3342.7s)]
*  But then when you look at that, like, do you blame him? [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3346.02s)]
*  Cause you know all his competitions doing the same shit. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3348.22s)]
*  Right? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3351.14s)]
*  What is that? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3351.98s)]
*  No, no, she means Mr. Olympia. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3352.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh, Mr. Olympia, of course. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3354.66s)]
*  Of course, that's the same way I think about like [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3356.22s)]
*  Tour de France. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3358.5s)]
*  Tour de France is a dirty sport and it always was. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3359.8199999999997s)]
*  And you know, the greatest documentary about it is Icarus. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3363.66s)]
*  And it's not about Tour de France, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3366.62s)]
*  but it's about bicycle racing and doping [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3367.7799999999997s)]
*  and how prevalent it is. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3370.22s)]
*  Worldwide, it's amazing. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3372.18s)]
*  Have you seen it? [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3374.7s)]
*  No. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3375.54s)]
*  Brian Fogel? [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3376.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, we had Brian on the show. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3377.2s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3378.04s)]
*  He's the same guy that did the dissident, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3378.8599999999997s)]
*  the Amok Shogi documentary, [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3380.58s)]
*  which is another amazing documentary. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3382.3399999999997s)]
*  He's fucking fantastic. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3384.98s)]
*  But it's a dirty business. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3386.8999999999996s)]
*  It's a dirty business. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3388.98s)]
*  So other people are doing it too? [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3391.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3392.94s)]
*  But that's why I want people to be honest in the manner. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3393.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3395.74s)]
*  Like I work out at a bodybuilding gym and so I'm like, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3396.58s)]
*  there's guys who are on gear and then there's guys [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3398.92s)]
*  who aren't fucking on gear. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3400.7s)]
*  And that's just what it is. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3402.38s)]
*  But the liver king thing drove me nuts [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3403.22s)]
*  because you were looking at teenagers who thought, [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3405.14s)]
*  they're like, oh, this is real if I eat bowl testicles [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3406.94s)]
*  or if I buy whatever his bullshit supplements are. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3409.38s)]
*  I don't want to say bullshit. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3412.34s)]
*  Whatever his supplements were. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3413.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't think the supplements are bad [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3414.22s)]
*  because what he's doing is desiccated organ meat. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3416.1s)]
*  And there's actually been peer-reviewed studies [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3418.58s)]
*  on feeding desiccated liver. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3420.46s)]
*  I think it was to, see if you can find it. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3423.34s)]
*  I think it's to mice. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3424.86s)]
*  I also want to see the ads when you have a chance. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3426.9s)]
*  His ads? [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3429.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3429.84s)]
*  There's quite a few people that have those now. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3430.68s)]
*  People are accusing Oscar De La Hoya of having them now. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3432.8399999999997s)]
*  I saw Oscar say he got etching. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3435.3599999999997s)]
*  He got etching. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3437.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh, okay, he's being honest. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3438.2s)]
*  Etching. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3439.04s)]
*  Yeah, he got etched on a radio show. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3439.8799999999997s)]
*  Oscar's being honest. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3440.72s)]
*  Good for him. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3441.64s)]
*  What do you think, Crystal? [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3443.3599999999997s)]
*  Good for Oscar. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3444.2s)]
*  So those look to me preposterous. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3445.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3448.04s)]
*  The amount, it just doesn't make sense. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3448.8799999999997s)]
*  Now you do have people that are outliers. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3451.72s)]
*  Like there's certain people that just have bizarre traps [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3454.3599999999997s)]
*  or crazy back muscles. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3457.2s)]
*  Like right there, if you show me that picture on the right, [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3458.68s)]
*  I would say that looks fine. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3461.68s)]
*  Reasonable, yeah. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3463.48s)]
*  That's a guy who's just jacked. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3465.0s)]
*  But there's something about the one on the far left [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3466.8799999999997s)]
*  where he's holding up the piece of liver. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3468.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3470.3199999999997s)]
*  That is just like, what is going on there? [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3471.16s)]
*  Yeah, I buy that. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3473.2799999999997s)]
*  But also. Especially knowing now. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3475.52s)]
*  Sauce to the fucking gills. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3476.8399999999997s)]
*  That was the best part about Derek's video. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3481.24s)]
*  It's like 12 grand a month on his entire hormone stack. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3482.56s)]
*  When Derek got ahold of all of the, yeah, I mean, come on, son. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3485.72s)]
*  They look great, but. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3490.3199999999997s)]
*  Do they though? [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3492.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's not to my taste. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3493.68s)]
*  I'll just say that. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3494.96s)]
*  Oh, you're just being nice to Kyle. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3495.7999999999997s)]
*  I want to see Kyle on the sauce. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3502.44s)]
*  You know what it is? [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3504.3599999999997s)]
*  It's like people like different things. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3505.2s)]
*  And you can't, oh, you're wrong. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3507.16s)]
*  That music sucks. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3509.7599999999998s)]
*  No, it sucks to you. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3510.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3511.8399999999997s)]
*  Some people want a giant juiced up fucking Viking dude. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3512.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3516.6s)]
*  That's what they want. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3517.44s)]
*  And some people want like an Alex Honnold, [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3518.2799999999997s)]
*  like the guy who climbs the rocks. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3520.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah, I love that guy. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3521.7999999999997s)]
*  Like slim and lean. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3522.64s)]
*  Like people like different things. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3523.68s)]
*  So to some people, that's the optimal physique. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3524.8399999999997s)]
*  The problem is they're a little. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3527.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that looks. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3530.2799999999997s)]
*  They're like a little different. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3531.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3532.12s)]
*  But oh my, yeah, that physique is ridiculous. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3532.96s)]
*  Look how lean he is. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3534.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3535.7999999999997s)]
*  Freakish. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3536.64s)]
*  It really is freakish. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3537.48s)]
*  Well, they, you know, like he's in the middle [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3538.3199999999997s)]
*  of full exertion there, right? [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3540.64s)]
*  He's throwing a spear. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3542.7999999999997s)]
*  Look, the guy's built like a brick shithouse. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3544.12s)]
*  No if, ands, or but. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3546.3999999999996s)]
*  And you don't get that way without putting in a lot of work. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3547.4799999999996s)]
*  That guy works hard. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3550.12s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3551.3199999999997s)]
*  There's no way you get there without the hard work. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3552.8799999999997s)]
*  Like the real tragedy in this is that this guy [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3555.7599999999998s)]
*  had an opportunity to say what's possible [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3559.4799999999996s)]
*  with chemical intervention. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3562.04s)]
*  And here's the pros and cons. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3563.7999999999997s)]
*  And this is the dangers of it. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3565.2799999999997s)]
*  And also this is the nutrition that I take [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3566.2s)]
*  to optimize my body, which is also critical. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3568.88s)]
*  You cannot get to that physique with just steroids. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3572.48s)]
*  You must have amazing work ethic, incredible discipline, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3576.6s)]
*  ability to push through exertion [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3580.88s)]
*  and just have a fucking force of will. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3583.92s)]
*  And you have to have amazing nutrition. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3587.12s)]
*  You have to be really fucking healthy [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3589.6400000000003s)]
*  to allow all those tissues to recover and nourish them [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3591.7200000000003s)]
*  and then stay that lean. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3595.12s)]
*  So you have to be very disciplined with your diet. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3596.8s)]
*  So what he's done is very, very, very impressive. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3599.5600000000004s)]
*  But he lied. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3602.92s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3604.92s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3605.76s)]
*  And it's such a disservice. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3606.6000000000004s)]
*  Is he, I admit I haven't watched a lot of Liver King content. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3607.44s)]
*  I'm not exactly in the core demo for this. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3611.0800000000004s)]
*  Is he like, is he a charismatic guy? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3614.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, you feel like if he hadn't cheated [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3616.6400000000003s)]
*  and lied and whatever, he still could have made it. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3619.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, I don't know. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3621.88s)]
*  We don't know. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3624.6400000000003s)]
*  I think so. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3625.84s)]
*  I think that there's been a bunch of people [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3626.76s)]
*  that are openly taking performance enhancing drugs [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3629.2s)]
*  and have enormous social media platforms. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3631.84s)]
*  Yeah, oh, absolutely. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3633.96s)]
*  I don't think that's the problem. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3634.8s)]
*  I think the problem is just being dishonest. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3636.12s)]
*  If you're the Liver King and you're talking about your stack [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3638.28s)]
*  and explaining to people what you take [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3640.76s)]
*  and that you're doing it all legally [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3642.72s)]
*  and then you're also eating all this food. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3644.68s)]
*  The question is, is that a thing [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3647.96s)]
*  that would influence other people to do that [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3651.12s)]
*  when they shouldn't do that? [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3653.04s)]
*  And I think that's a personal choice. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3654.6s)]
*  I think the real responsibility that someone has [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3656.7999999999997s)]
*  when you're in that situation, if you are doing that stuff, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3660.0s)]
*  you should be honest about what you're doing [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3663.36s)]
*  and then also honest if something goes wrong. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3665.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's important. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3668.04s)]
*  So I didn't get into health and fitness [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3668.92s)]
*  till like two years ago or so. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3670.2s)]
*  And it's so important to have realistic expectations [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3672.44s)]
*  about what you can do, about what you can get, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3676.2799999999997s)]
*  about what it actually means to diet. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3679.3199999999997s)]
*  So like Dr. Lane Norton, who I use as app carbon, [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3681.08s)]
*  you realize after a couple of weeks into a cut, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3684.68s)]
*  you're like, oh, this fucking sucks. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3686.44s)]
*  And you're like, and I'm only losing, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3687.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm only losing whatever, two pounds a week. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3689.48s)]
*  And then also even with heavy resistance training, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3692.2s)]
*  four times a week, diet relatively on point, [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3695.48s)]
*  shit is hard, man. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3698.24s)]
*  It takes years. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3699.3199999999997s)]
*  You are not gonna look like Liver King overnight. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3700.36s)]
*  And that's actually important to understand that. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3702.72s)]
*  Well, I mean, number one, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3704.84s)]
*  you just aren't gonna look like Liver King [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3706.52s)]
*  unless you do what he did. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3708.2799999999997s)]
*  But number two, I mean, yeah, some people, [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3709.7999999999997s)]
*  that's just never gonna be on the menu. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3711.44s)]
*  Totally. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3713.68s)]
*  But I'm more saying like for kids, [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3714.68s)]
*  especially, look, I didn't know a fucking thing [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3716.3599999999997s)]
*  before I started consuming all this content [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3718.24s)]
*  and like Puberman and all these other folks, [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3719.8399999999997s)]
*  Derek, all these videos. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3722.4s)]
*  And Derek had a video once of a guy [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3723.68s)]
*  who was like one year out, I think it was like, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3725.48s)]
*  this is what a realistic like six pounds of muscle looks like. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3727.44s)]
*  And he was like, yeah, it doesn't look great. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3729.96s)]
*  He's like, but that's what it looks like, man. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3731.68s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, that's actually very helpful to me [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3733.04s)]
*  as somebody who was just starting off from the ground. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3735.24s)]
*  And then I think about 22 year old me, [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3737.92s)]
*  I would have fallen for it, man. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3740.0s)]
*  I would have bought the supplements. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3741.16s)]
*  I would have bought the, you know, if I was 18 years old, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3742.32s)]
*  absolutely, I'm like fat kid in call station. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3744.28s)]
*  If you really thought that's all it took to get jacked. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3746.48s)]
*  Yeah, I'm like, that's all it takes. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3748.0s)]
*  I'm like, fuck yeah, I'll do that. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3749.0800000000004s)]
*  Sign me up, yeah. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3749.92s)]
*  It's like you gotta consume good information [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3750.76s)]
*  and have real expectations around that stuff. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3752.76s)]
*  And that's the biggest problem, I think, [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3755.56s)]
*  with like Manosphere and Instagram culture and all that. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3756.96s)]
*  There's some great ones out there, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3759.6800000000003s)]
*  like Lane, like Puberman and a few others, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3760.6400000000003s)]
*  but yeah, a lot of fucking thrifters. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3763.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, and to go back to Andrew Tate, [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3765.36s)]
*  apparently part of what he's arguing is like, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3767.6000000000004s)]
*  oh, this is just a character that I'm playing. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3769.6800000000003s)]
*  But it's like, you know, at the end of the day, [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3771.68s)]
*  does it really- Is he arguing that? [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3773.48s)]
*  I think so, I think I saw that. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3774.7999999999997s)]
*  But at the end of the day, does it matter [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3776.3199999999997s)]
*  if you're playing a character, if people believe it? [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3778.0s)]
*  You know, then there's no difference [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3781.12s)]
*  whether you're just like playing a ridiculous character [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3782.48s)]
*  because you're still selling the same thing [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3785.3999999999996s)]
*  to a public that's buying it. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3787.0s)]
*  Yeah, then what do you do about Stephen Colbert? [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3788.7999999999997s)]
*  When the Colbert report- He just worshiped him [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3791.3199999999997s)]
*  because he was great. That was just a character. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3794.08s)]
*  That was a character, yeah. That was a great one. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3795.48s)]
*  He was great on that show as that character. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3797.3199999999997s)]
*  That show was so funny. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3799.16s)]
*  That character was amazing. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3800.0s)]
*  It was. It was amazing on The Daily Show. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3801.7999999999997s)]
*  When he went and did the like, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3803.12s)]
*  roast of the president at the White House Correspondents [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3804.9599999999996s)]
*  with George W. Oh, it was so amazing. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3807.9199999999996s)]
*  I like it so much better than the real one. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3808.7599999999998s)]
*  I know. Like the real guy does the talk show. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3811.3999999999996s)]
*  The new one is so cringey. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3813.2799999999997s)]
*  You need to get them Daily Show writers back. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3814.4799999999996s)]
*  Let's go back in the closet, buddy. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3816.52s)]
*  Last time we were here- Put the character back on. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3818.8799999999997s)]
*  It was so much funnier. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3821.3999999999996s)]
*  I remember last time we were here was the day after [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3822.4399999999996s)]
*  he fucked up Jon Stewart's bit on the Wuhan Wall. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3824.12s)]
*  About the, about Lamplight. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3826.72s)]
*  Yes, yes. Yeah, that's right. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3828.24s)]
*  You're stepping on him. I got that from you. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3829.08s)]
*  You're stepping on his fucking bit. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3830.44s)]
*  100% on purpose. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3831.28s)]
*  That was the first time I watched that thing, [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3832.76s)]
*  was he alive with you guys? [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3834.16s)]
*  Hilarious. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3835.84s)]
*  Well, he just, the narrative was like, [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3836.68s)]
*  you saw his yacht slipping away. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3838.68s)]
*  He's like, no. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3840.28s)]
*  Well, I'd like to see some evidence if you have it. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3841.52s)]
*  Hi, well, I've had dinner with the folks at Farsher. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3845.36s)]
*  They're wonderful people. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3848.32s)]
*  But I don't even think it's that. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3849.6s)]
*  I think it's like the social proof thing. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3851.36s)]
*  Like we're talking about, I mean, people feel like, [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3853.0s)]
*  oh, this is my club and this is my tribe. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3854.96s)]
*  And so I gotta like represent them [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3856.92s)]
*  or I'm gonna get backlash. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3858.6s)]
*  I'm not gonna get invited to the party. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3859.6s)]
*  That'd be terrible. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3860.96s)]
*  Have you ever seen him dancing with Chuck Schumer? [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3861.7999999999997s)]
*  Of course. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3863.4s)]
*  When they high-fives Chuck Schumer. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3864.24s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3866.2799999999997s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3867.44s)]
*  You're in the club, buddy. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3868.2799999999997s)]
*  You made it. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3869.12s)]
*  Congratulations. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3869.96s)]
*  Yes. Hope it feels good. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3871.56s)]
*  But that is what was the only thing that was available [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3873.68s)]
*  until independent media arose. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3877.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3879.48s)]
*  You had to do that. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3880.3199999999997s)]
*  And if you wanted to be the- [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3881.16s)]
*  That's true. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3882.24s)]
*  That's why like Jay Leno hid in the closet [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3883.08s)]
*  when they were discussing, you know, the Tonight Show. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3884.8399999999997s)]
*  Like everybody wanted to be the head [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3887.24s)]
*  of a late night talk show. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3890.68s)]
*  And if you can find a way to get to that spot, [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3891.8399999999997s)]
*  that was the holy grail. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3894.52s)]
*  That was the thing that everybody wanted to get to. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3896.3599999999997s)]
*  I watched that documentary, the comedy show, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3899.2799999999997s)]
*  or the comedy store, about the comedy store. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3902.2s)]
*  That era was like so crazy. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3904.52s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3906.3199999999997s)]
*  Where it's all anybody wanted was to get on that. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3907.16s)]
*  And that actually, I don't know, I'm of two minds. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3909.2799999999997s)]
*  I didn't grow up in that. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3912.16s)]
*  You know, I was born in 92. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3913.0s)]
*  So by the time I was like aware, I was on the internet. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3914.08s)]
*  But there seemed something comfortable [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3916.36s)]
*  about that mass media environment. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3918.6400000000003s)]
*  Like the three channels, the Walter Cronkites, [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3920.08s)]
*  everybody looks at that as an era, which was better. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3922.52s)]
*  But you know, a lot of the reading I've done [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3924.76s)]
*  in terms of JFK and Vietnam lies and all that, [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3926.96s)]
*  I'm like, I think shit was just as bad. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3929.6s)]
*  It was like, we just didn't hear about it. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3931.44s)]
*  People just had no idea what was going on. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3933.4s)]
*  But you know, I mean, when you talk about JFK, [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3935.2400000000002s)]
*  which is like, this is another one of the things [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3937.56s)]
*  that I've gotten really into. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3939.4s)]
*  I mean, it's not like the public bought the narrative ever. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3940.8s)]
*  They never bought the narrative. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3943.7200000000003s)]
*  They still don't buy the narrative. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3945.08s)]
*  But I do think in general, it was easier for them [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3947.64s)]
*  to sell a unified, like propagandistic narrative [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3950.24s)]
*  to the American people, except when it came to things [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3953.96s)]
*  that were just like farcical on their face. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3956.16s)]
*  And you have something like a late night talk show. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3958.4s)]
*  It's so easy to co-opt. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3960.7999999999997s)]
*  All you have to do is just like advertise on it. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3962.72s)]
*  And then you kind of control what the people can [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3965.44s)]
*  and can't talk about. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3968.16s)]
*  It's not hard at all. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3969.12s)]
*  I mean, that's the thing with the existing, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3970.16s)]
*  the legacy media business models. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3972.72s)]
*  There's no, you know, CNN has a new boss [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3976.04s)]
*  and he's saying different things and trying to, [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3978.36s)]
*  it's like, you're still dealing [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3979.96s)]
*  with the same beast here though. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3981.64s)]
*  Same incentive structure. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3983.08s)]
*  You're gonna find yourself falling [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3984.6s)]
*  into the exact same mistakes and holes. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3986.04s)]
*  I mean, that's why, you know, you see the same dynamic [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3988.52s)]
*  going on at Twitter right now, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3991.88s)]
*  where it's like the part of the reason they were making [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3993.6s)]
*  the censorship decisions they were was because of ideology. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3996.04s)]
*  And I think that comes out in the Twitter files. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=3998.56s)]
*  Like you had a couple of people, [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4000.16s)]
*  you had a lot of people who didn't wanna make a decision. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4001.56s)]
*  They're just like, you know, that's in general, [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4003.4s)]
*  people don't like being responsible or making decisions. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4005.12s)]
*  And then you had a couple of really ideological actors. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4007.7599999999998s)]
*  But you also see in the fallout with advertisers fleeing now [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4010.48s)]
*  that a lot of the reason these censorship decisions [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4014.72s)]
*  were driven was about the money, [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4017.48s)]
*  it was about the bottom line. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4018.6s)]
*  It was still just like with legacy media, [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4019.52s)]
*  it was the advertisers shaping what was the bounds [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4021.84s)]
*  of acceptable discourse. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4025.32s)]
*  You see that on Twitter, you see it on YouTube. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4026.56s)]
*  I mean, anywhere that's ad supported, [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4028.2799999999997s)]
*  you're gonna have that same dynamic. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4029.68s)]
*  We have that shit constantly on YouTube. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4031.0s)]
*  It's like you do a video about Jeffrey Epstein, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4032.48s)]
*  fucking kiss it goodbye. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4034.0s)]
*  Oh, you did a video about the vaccine, forget it, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4035.12s)]
*  kiss it goodbye. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4037.68s)]
*  You did a video about gain of function. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4038.52s)]
*  Oh, my favorite was about, [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4040.32s)]
*  do you remember the Chinese tennis star, Peng Shuai? [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4042.6s)]
*  She accused that guy of rape. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4044.96s)]
*  That video got demonetized on our channel. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4047.32s)]
*  And they were like, hey, [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4049.2s)]
*  all videos on sexual assault are demonetized. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4050.16s)]
*  I look at, well, first of all, when you do news, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4052.8s)]
*  sometimes the news is fucking bad. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4054.84s)]
*  So I don't know what incentive you're setting here, [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4056.24s)]
*  but we've done other videos on sexual assault [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4059.04s)]
*  that weren't demonetized. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4061.6800000000003s)]
*  They told us literally anything to do [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4062.52s)]
*  with a Me Too story was demonetized out of the case. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4064.2400000000002s)]
*  It was like number one. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4069.32s)]
*  Well, it's controversial. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4070.1600000000003s)]
*  So people don't want their advertising. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4071.0s)]
*  No, we get it. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4071.84s)]
*  That's it. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4072.6800000000003s)]
*  That's it, exactly. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4073.52s)]
*  But then you think about the incentive structure [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4074.36s)]
*  you're creating, how many people are gonna wanna [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4076.92s)]
*  cover those stories, knowing that they're not gonna [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4078.8s)]
*  make any money off of it. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4080.96s)]
*  I mean, we built our business model so that we could try [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4082.2400000000002s)]
*  to insulate ourselves from those incentives [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4085.28s)]
*  because we're human beings too. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4087.04s)]
*  And we don't wanna be so arrogant to assume [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4088.52s)]
*  that we're not also shaped by whatever incentive structure [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4090.4s)]
*  we ultimately live in. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4092.76s)]
*  But yeah, that's how you end up with Twitter, [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4094.12s)]
*  Facebook, YouTube, et cetera, making very similar [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4096.68s)]
*  content moderation decisions because ultimately [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4099.56s)]
*  it's all about what the advertisers [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4102.0s)]
*  are gonna feel comfy with. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4103.4800000000005s)]
*  Let me tell you a story about when we got [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4104.4400000000005s)]
*  the Spotify deal. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4106.28s)]
*  Yeah, tell us. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4107.28s)]
*  We were always getting demonetized. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4108.12s)]
*  We got demonetized. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4109.72s)]
*  YouTube paid us a lot of money and I, look, [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4111.04s)]
*  I'm not an anti-YouTube person. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4114.04s)]
*  I love them. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4115.52s)]
*  I think the problem with YouTube is monitoring at scale. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4116.36s)]
*  Yes. Yes. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4119.08s)]
*  And managing the insane amount of content [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4120.4400000000005s)]
*  that goes through YouTube, it's fucking impossible. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4123.16s)]
*  And then you have ideological actors that are inside [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4125.76s)]
*  the company and you have mandates and they have [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4129.72s)]
*  their own opinions about things that lean heavily left. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4133.4800000000005s)]
*  But we were getting demonetized like 25% of our videos. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4137.16s)]
*  But it's like, okay, I don't change. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4141.92s)]
*  This is what I do. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4143.76s)]
*  And most of the money that I was making was actually [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4145.0s)]
*  off of advertisers on iTunes. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4147.2s)]
*  So we go over to Spotify and then magically [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4150.84s)]
*  all our demonetization stops. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4154.400000000001s)]
*  Really? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4156.400000000001s)]
*  Because they wanted to get all the rest of the money [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4157.24s)]
*  before we left. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4159.2s)]
*  Oh, that's fascinating. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4160.28s)]
*  Right, Jamie? [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4161.76s)]
*  Did we have any of them that were demonetized [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4162.6s)]
*  after the Spotify? [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4164.400000000001s)]
*  There might've been like one. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4165.24s)]
*  That is fascinating. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4166.88s)]
*  Maybe one, if we had Alex Jones on it. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4168.04s)]
*  Yeah, I was just gonna say that. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4169.6s)]
*  They were like, oh, the Alex Jones one. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4171.4400000000005s)]
*  We'd like that cash, but we just can't do it. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4173.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, or someone like fucking super off the grid crazy. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4175.400000000001s)]
*  I don't know who it was, but maybe we had one. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4180.72s)]
*  But it was the difference between 25% of our revenue [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4183.24s)]
*  from YouTube. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4186.16s)]
*  It's a significant amount of money. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4187.0s)]
*  So you would self-censor. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4188.4400000000005s)]
*  And I know that there's many friends that I have [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4190.32s)]
*  that are making YouTube shows and they self-censor. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4192.4400000000005s)]
*  Let me give you a good example. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4195.12s)]
*  We cover the news, obviously. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4196.36s)]
*  So YouTube has a policy where if you play a clip [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4197.76s)]
*  of Trump claiming that the election was stolen, [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4200.4400000000005s)]
*  that they're gonna take down that whole video. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4203.4800000000005s)]
*  And I was like, well, so we're a politics show. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4205.28s)]
*  We cover Donald Trump. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4208.0s)]
*  When we play clips, that doesn't mean necessarily [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4209.84s)]
*  that we agree or endorse those clips. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4211.96s)]
*  So how are we supposed to cover the news? [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4214.44s)]
*  And they were like, well, as long as you say [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4217.68s)]
*  that it's not true. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4219.2s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, okay, even probably would say that anyway. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4220.32s)]
*  But it's like, why are you dictating the way [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4223.96s)]
*  that I have to do my coverage? [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4226.44s)]
*  We're gonna cover a State of the Union in a couple of days, [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4228.12s)]
*  like a live stream. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4230.7s)]
*  So that's Biden. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4231.8s)]
*  I mean, are we supposed to interject every time [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4232.64s)]
*  he says something that's not true and live fact check it? [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4234.68s)]
*  No, because that's outrageous. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4237.38s)]
*  You play the clip and then afterwards you be like, [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4238.38s)]
*  okay, here's what I thought about the State of the Union. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4240.26s)]
*  If Trump is, he's gonna be possibly [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4242.34s)]
*  the next president of the United States, [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4244.46s)]
*  very least the probably the next Republican nominee. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4245.7s)]
*  How are we supposed to set that standard? [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4249.02s)]
*  Like you can't just make shit up for people. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4251.06s)]
*  Like it's the news. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4253.58s)]
*  If Nixon says, I'm not a crook. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4254.42s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4255.58s)]
*  You can't take that up on YouTube. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4256.42s)]
*  And then you're like, well, he might be a crook. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4257.26s)]
*  Well, it's possible. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4258.780000000001s)]
*  And you know. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4259.62s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4260.46s)]
*  Yeah, you have to be able to discuss it. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4262.34s)]
*  If someone says something crazy, you have to refute it. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4265.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4267.5s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4268.34s)]
*  And the other piece is, you know, [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4269.160000000001s)]
*  it'd be one thing if the standards were consistent [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4270.700000000001s)]
*  and clear, but they're just like, you just don't know. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4273.38s)]
*  I mean, just like with your videos, [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4276.42s)]
*  something suddenly they were monetized [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4277.740000000001s)]
*  and huh, who knows why or what happened [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4279.780000000001s)]
*  or what that conversation was like. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4282.38s)]
*  And so it makes it a challenging, challenging situation. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4283.9400000000005s)]
*  I understand their place. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4287.780000000001s)]
*  I understand what they're doing. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4290.06s)]
*  I get it. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4291.38s)]
*  And I understand they're trying to make [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4292.22s)]
*  the most money possible. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4294.660000000001s)]
*  And there's an enormous industry that's around that. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4295.900000000001s)]
*  And they're incredibly successful. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4298.660000000001s)]
*  And I'm very, very happy for you two. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4300.06s)]
*  Same. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4301.9800000000005s)]
*  But it's an issue. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4302.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4303.660000000001s)]
*  That in particular is a giant issue. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4304.5s)]
*  That's a logical problem. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4306.1s)]
*  But the problem is if you say, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4308.540000000001s)]
*  okay, we'll let Crystal and Sager talk about, [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4310.9800000000005s)]
*  because they're gonna mock this guy's claims. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4313.540000000001s)]
*  But then you're gonna have some right wing, [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4316.320000000001s)]
*  like QAnon person who's going to put it [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4318.900000000001s)]
*  and then they're gonna have it. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4321.700000000001s)]
*  And we need to do this because of that. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4322.7s)]
*  And then it's a call to arms and oh, Jesus. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4324.66s)]
*  And then- [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4327.7s)]
*  It's a free country. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4328.54s)]
*  At the end of the day, you just gotta step back [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4329.36s)]
*  and be like, you know what? [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4330.58s)]
*  Is it a free country still? [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4331.42s)]
*  Well, no, I don't know about that. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4332.5s)]
*  And that is the thing. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4333.7s)]
*  Here's my real question about election fraud. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4334.86s)]
*  What percentage of election fraud do you think exists? [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4337.58s)]
*  Because I don't think it's zero. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4341.46s)]
*  I don't think it's zero, but I think it's fairly, [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4344.099999999999s)]
*  I mean, they'll go back and do like recounts [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4347.78s)]
*  when you have a close election or whatever. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4350.92s)]
*  Usually the count changes by maybe 50 or a hundred votes, [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4353.12s)]
*  but they've never been able to uncover like a large scale. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4356.24s)]
*  One of the only ones recently [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4360.92s)]
*  that may have shifted the results, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4362.9400000000005s)]
*  remember this one in North Carolina? [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4364.36s)]
*  It was actually a Republican candidate who won [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4366.12s)]
*  because they were using this like sketchy system [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4369.24s)]
*  of ballot harvesting and like that one actually got uncovered [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4372.12s)]
*  and it was a very close race. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4377.54s)]
*  And it was enough to throw the result. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4379.48s)]
*  That's the one of the only instances I know [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4382.04s)]
*  where there was enough sufficient [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4384.74s)]
*  to actually change what the result was. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4386.44s)]
*  It's important you ask that question too. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4388.2s)]
*  And we covered this at the time. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4389.5599999999995s)]
*  We were like, look, we're not gonna make fun of you. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4391.08s)]
*  We're gonna cover every single lawsuit [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4392.719999999999s)]
*  that the Trump campaign filed. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4394.679999999999s)]
*  We're like, here's the lawsuit. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4395.759999999999s)]
*  Here's what they alleged happened in Milwaukee. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4397.32s)]
*  Here's what they alleged happened in Arizona. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4399.32s)]
*  Here is what they were able to prove in court. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4401.48s)]
*  At the end of the day, that's probably what matters, right? [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4404.2s)]
*  Here's the judge ultimately dismissed it in this case. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4406.0s)]
*  And I believe, I don't remember the exact number of, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4408.84s)]
*  I wanna say it was like 40 or 50 cases. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4411.4800000000005s)]
*  Every single one of them was thrown out. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4414.12s)]
*  And so I think with election fraud, [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4415.92s)]
*  it's important also to think about [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4417.84s)]
*  what level of fraud is being alleged, [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4419.92s)]
*  what exists actually today, [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4422.28s)]
*  how corrupt our elections actually used to be. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4424.4400000000005s)]
*  In some measures, we actually have some of the least [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4427.0s)]
*  election fraud in modern American history. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4429.360000000001s)]
*  We're sitting in Texas, one of my favorite books, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4432.04s)]
*  Means of Ascent, which is about how LBJ straight up stole [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4434.04s)]
*  the 1948 Senate election here in Texas. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4436.84s)]
*  There's a lot that happened with JFK too. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4439.400000000001s)]
*  It's like box 13, where they straight up stuffed ballots [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4441.92s)]
*  on day six of the Democratic primary [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4445.0s)]
*  before the things were about to get counted. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4447.64s)]
*  And there was a whole Supreme Court loss. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4450.28s)]
*  Anyway, LBJ is never president [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4452.08s)]
*  without stealing that election. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4453.400000000001s)]
*  JFK, a lot of dead people voted in Chicago in 1960. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4454.96s)]
*  West Virginia. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4459.64s)]
*  I wanna revise my previous statement [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4461.4800000000005s)]
*  about that North Carolina election [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4464.76s)]
*  being the only one. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4467.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, to me, the most obvious example of election fraud [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4468.280000000001s)]
*  was the 2000 presidential election, [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4469.64s)]
*  where it was like, top down, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4471.240000000001s)]
*  and they had all the officials in place [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4473.0s)]
*  to get them to stop the count, [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4475.0s)]
*  and like, okay, it's gonna be George W. Bush. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4476.92s)]
*  So in my opinion, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4479.160000000001s)]
*  that was probably the greatest election fraud. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4480.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you got the secretary. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4482.6s)]
*  What was it? [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4484.08s)]
*  Okay, we're gonna have to go. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4484.92s)]
*  So you think that that was John Kerry, right? [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4485.76s)]
*  It was Gore. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4488.04s)]
*  No, that was Bush v. Gore when it went to the Supreme Court. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4488.88s)]
*  Which one was John Kerry? [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4490.72s)]
*  So, Jeb. That was 04. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4491.56s)]
*  04 was a weird one too, right? [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4492.72s)]
*  There were some allegations about, [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4494.360000000001s)]
*  this was a Democratic allegation against Ohio, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4495.8s)]
*  which went GOP. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4498.4400000000005s)]
*  But there was nothing on the level of, [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4499.76s)]
*  that I thought. So 2000's the one. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4502.360000000001s)]
*  Well, 2000, remember, that was with the hanging chats. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4504.080000000001s)]
*  Jeb Bush, George's brother, was the governor of the state. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4506.4400000000005s)]
*  So he was like in control. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4512.240000000001s)]
*  And so basically, they, when it looked like, [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4513.76s)]
*  okay, if we actually count all these ballots, [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4516.92s)]
*  it's gonna go to Gore. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4518.72s)]
*  I don't remember. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4520.320000000001s)]
*  Do you remember Hacking Democracy? [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4521.160000000001s)]
*  Of course, yeah. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4522.4800000000005s)]
*  Hacking Democracy. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4523.320000000001s)]
*  Is it HBO documentary? [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4524.160000000001s)]
*  HBO Democracy, the documentary rather, [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4525.4s)]
*  covered the issue with the Diebold machines. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4528.36s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4531.88s)]
*  The Diebold machines had a third party input available. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4532.72s)]
*  Where a third party could input information [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4535.84s)]
*  that would change the numbers. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4539.48s)]
*  And they did it live. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4541.72s)]
*  Like they did it on film. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4543.52s)]
*  And they showed how this can be done. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4546.16s)]
*  When was this from? [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4547.76s)]
*  I don't know anything about this. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4548.6s)]
*  It was in the, it was about the Bush elections. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4549.44s)]
*  Because one of the allegations was that Diebold [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4551.4s)]
*  was a huge contributor to the Republican Party. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4554.28s)]
*  Wasn't there some chainy connection there to the man? [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4556.4s)]
*  Of course. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4558.96s)]
*  That guy doesn't have his fucking hands and everything. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4559.8s)]
*  Arrrrr. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4562.679999999999s)]
*  He was like immortal too. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4563.88s)]
*  He's literally in the Bible. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4564.719999999999s)]
*  It's important though. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4566.4s)]
*  He's a man with no heartbeat. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4567.24s)]
*  Remember when he had that fake heart? [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4569.36s)]
*  We had no heartbeat. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4571.08s)]
*  We had three hearts, right? [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4571.92s)]
*  He had an artificial thing going on where he had no pulse. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4574.08s)]
*  So it was just like circulating his blood. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4578.5199999999995s)]
*  Now he's got someone else's heart in there. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4581.44s)]
*  He's a creepy one. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4582.759999999999s)]
*  I used to have a joke about him. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4583.64s)]
*  They had one Secret Service agent that didn't get to eat [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4584.84s)]
*  what everybody else ate. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4588.120000000001s)]
*  And he was on this vegan diet. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4589.280000000001s)]
*  And they were giving him all these pills. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4592.52s)]
*  Like what the fuck, why am I jogging every day? [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4593.76s)]
*  Oh, you think you can take it so much? [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4595.4800000000005s)]
*  And he was just the guy in the moment chainy drops dead. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4597.400000000001s)]
*  They fucking shoot this guy in the head. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4600.56s)]
*  Takes him duck hunting. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4602.240000000001s)]
*  Pulls up his chest and pulls his fucking heart out [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4603.08s)]
*  and stuff it into dick chaining. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4605.92s)]
*  They take him on the duck hunt, chain shoots him. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4607.4400000000005s)]
*  The quail hunt. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4609.4400000000005s)]
*  Quail hunt. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4610.280000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm sorry. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4611.120000000001s)]
*  You know those are the most gross hunts of all time. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4611.96s)]
*  They just open a box and they let these birds fly out. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4615.2s)]
*  It's called a canned hunt. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4618.6s)]
*  Wow. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4620.04s)]
*  They're the grossest hunts of all time. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4620.88s)]
*  How do you enjoy that? [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4622.36s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4623.28s)]
*  You have to be a person just like shooting birds [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4624.36s)]
*  out of the sky. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4626.2s)]
*  Well, we have this thing, and I did this post once [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4627.52s)]
*  about the hierarchy of dead animals on social media. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4630.6s)]
*  And I said, okay, I'm gonna show you a piece of fish. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4634.68s)]
*  No one's gonna be offended. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4638.64s)]
*  And then I'm gonna show you a dead fish. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4640.12s)]
*  Still, fish, they don't even take care of their kids. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4642.08s)]
*  Fuck fish. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4644.8s)]
*  Right? [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4645.64s)]
*  No one cares about fish. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4646.48s)]
*  And then I was holding up a dead turkey. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4647.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4648.64s)]
*  Like this is a turkey I shot. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4649.48s)]
*  Okay. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4650.32s)]
*  And then I had a package of bear meat. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4651.14s)]
*  And I'm like, this is just bear meat. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4653.24s)]
*  What kind of bear? [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4654.48s)]
*  Like black bear that I ate. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4655.32s)]
*  I shot him and I ate him. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4656.72s)]
*  Like black bear is a very edible and delicious. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4658.2s)]
*  In fact, the pioneers that traveled across the country [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4660.5599999999995s)]
*  during the Daniel Boone days, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4663.36s)]
*  they preferred black bear meat over venison. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4664.92s)]
*  Because of the fat, I'm assuming. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4668.08s)]
*  It just was closer to beef. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4669.04s)]
*  It's very close to beef. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4670.84s)]
*  So they ate bears and they used deer for skins. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4671.96s)]
*  So they all wore their clothes, their buck skins. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4676.36s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4678.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4679.8s)]
*  A buck, the word buck, the dollar buck comes from. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4680.62s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4684.0s)]
*  One buckskin is worth a dollar. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4684.84s)]
*  So that's where a buck comes from. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4687.36s)]
*  I think you've had him on, Clay Newcomb, is that right? [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4688.88s)]
*  Yes. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4690.96s)]
*  Yeah, he's got a great series on this. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4691.8s)]
*  He's amazing. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4692.64s)]
*  Clay Newcomb is the Bear Grease podcast. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4693.4800000000005s)]
*  He's a brilliant guy from Arkansas. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4696.76s)]
*  I love that guy to death. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4699.16s)]
*  And he talks about the history of this country [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4700.6s)]
*  and wild animal conservation and stuff. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4703.76s)]
*  But that's one of the parts of the story [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4707.4800000000005s)]
*  is that people ate bears. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4711.320000000001s)]
*  That was the favorite food. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4713.64s)]
*  So did people. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4716.08s)]
*  That's the picture of my bear meat. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4716.92s)]
*  And so did people, were they like, you're a monster, [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4718.52s)]
*  you murdered Winnie the Pooh, basically? [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4720.64s)]
*  No, no, no, everyone was fine with it [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4722.0s)]
*  because I didn't have a dead bear. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4723.320000000001s)]
*  But if it was the dead bear, [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4724.84s)]
*  it would not be Debra. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4726.16s)]
*  But if you had a gripping grin, [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4727.0s)]
*  I think it would be Debra. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4727.84s)]
*  Yeah, well there's pictures of me with a dead bear. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4728.66s)]
*  Oh, that's fine. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4729.8s)]
*  And people get very upset at it. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4730.64s)]
*  But look, I ate that bear. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4731.64s)]
*  And by the way, that bear, [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4732.84s)]
*  here's something that people need to understand about bears. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4735.68s)]
*  Because people think about bears like, [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4737.88s)]
*  oh, this is a beautiful animal in the forest [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4740.16s)]
*  and it's also a teddy bear, it's Winnie the Pooh. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4742.2s)]
*  I was there when there was a brawl [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4744.84s)]
*  between a male bear and a female bear. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4748.12s)]
*  And the female bear scared the male bear off [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4751.12s)]
*  and the male bear killed one of her cubs [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4754.12s)]
*  and then she ate the cub. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4756.96s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4759.16s)]
*  So she scared the male bear off of the cub that was killed [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4760.84s)]
*  and then she ate the cub. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4764.92s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4766.24s)]
*  You know there's that bear fighting grizzly man? [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4767.08s)]
*  My friend saw it. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4768.4s)]
*  Oh, that's crazy. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4769.24s)]
*  He was there while this happened, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4770.0599999999995s)]
*  while we were all in camp. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4770.9s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4772.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, so, you know, and there's, [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4773.4s)]
*  I mean, you're hunting something that can kill you too. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4776.24s)]
*  There's a kind of a wild part of that too. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4778.04s)]
*  Like you're not just hunting a deer. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4781.4s)]
*  You're not hunting. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4782.96s)]
*  You're not hunting a quail that have just been released [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4784.4800000000005s)]
*  from a fox for your pleasure. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4787.04s)]
*  My joke about Chaney was he shot his friend in the face [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4788.6s)]
*  and his friend apologized. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4791.12s)]
*  He's like, sorry, I look like a bird. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4792.56s)]
*  Go fuck, don't kill me, bro. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4795.16s)]
*  I mean, he got shot in the face by Darth Vader. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4798.08s)]
*  You gotta let it go. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4801.72s)]
*  You gotta let that one go. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4803.2s)]
*  It's so weird how much the culture has changed. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4805.0s)]
*  Like in terms of the way that the theocratic right [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4807.0s)]
*  and like the way they would think about [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4809.4800000000005s)]
*  like who was advocating for censorship. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4810.72s)]
*  That's where I grew up. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4812.52s)]
*  You grew up here in Texas. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4813.88s)]
*  And then it's like you get to DC [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4814.719999999999s)]
*  and then I feel like everything changed very quickly. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4815.839999999999s)]
*  It was always bipartisan, honestly, [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4819.2s)]
*  because if you go back to the Tipper Gore days, [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4820.92s)]
*  that was Al Gore's wife. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4823.36s)]
*  And she was the one that was advocating [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4824.5599999999995s)]
*  for censorship of rap videos and rap songs. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4826.2s)]
*  Well, there was a whole- [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4829.719999999999s)]
*  What was it called, the V-chip or something like that? [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4830.5599999999995s)]
*  It was like the censorship chip in television [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4832.96s)]
*  or video games, I wanna say. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4835.719999999999s)]

*  Is that South Park? [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4858.2s)]
*  Oh my God, the V-chip. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4860.320000000001s)]
*  That's where they ended up with just this. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4862.64s)]
*  TVPG, yeah. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4864.64s)]
*  Yeah, and they started putting the ratings [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4866.52s)]
*  on the video games. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4868.400000000001s)]

*  listening to Straight Outta Compton for the first time. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4878.4800000000005s)]
*  And I was like, holy shit. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4880.84s)]
*  This is crazy. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4883.4400000000005s)]
*  At the time, I was like a young man in my early 20s [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4885.4400000000005s)]

*  These guys are wild. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4905.0s)]
*  I mean, I was living the wildest life. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4906.639999999999s)]
*  I had no health insurance. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4908.28s)]
*  I was out there fighting for no money. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4909.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4911.04s)]

*  Wow. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4913.679999999999s)]

*  Wow. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4915.36s)]
*  But listening to that, I was like, this is crazy. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4916.2s)]
*  So I can imagine if you're some dumpy housewife [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4918.839999999999s)]
*  who's married to some politicians, [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4921.48s)]
*  I'm gonna put a stop to this. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4924.08s)]
*  This is outrageous. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4925.5599999999995s)]
*  Your son comes home straight outta Compton. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4926.4s)]
*  No, no, no, not my Billy. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4928.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's so true. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4930.92s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4932.32s)]
*  I sort of struggle with now, [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4933.5599999999995s)]
*  like the music that is popular [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4935.28s)]
*  and what's age appropriate for my children, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4937.759999999999s)]
*  even the censored versions, [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4939.96s)]
*  because it is just like, it is a lot. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4941.2s)]
*  I'm not saying any of it should be censored, [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4943.28s)]
*  but in terms of my own personal choices in the household, [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4945.16s)]
*  what's appropriate for the kiddos. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4947.879999999999s)]
*  An approach that was, my parents were hippies, luckily. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4949.759999999999s)]
*  My mother and my stepfather were hippies, [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4953.799999999999s)]
*  and they didn't care what I did. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4955.5199999999995s)]
*  They were like, I want you to be you. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4957.2s)]
*  You can swear if you want to. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4959.8s)]
*  You can say whatever, but don't swear when you go to school [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4961.599999999999s)]
*  or get in trouble. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4964.36s)]
*  Don't swear around people's parents. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4965.2s)]
*  They'll get upset at you. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4966.68s)]
*  And they just were real reasonable about it. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4967.8s)]
*  So because of that, I had this open way of communication. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4969.599999999999s)]
*  So I have that with my kids. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4972.28s)]
*  I'm like, you can swear. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4974.36s)]
*  My wife used to get upset in the beginning. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4975.36s)]
*  She was like, stop saying fuck around the kids. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4978.12s)]
*  I'm like, they need to know that that's a word, [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4980.5199999999995s)]
*  because someday someone's gonna say it, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4982.44s)]
*  it's gonna make them feel bad. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4983.88s)]
*  I can see that when they're in, even third grade, fourth, [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4985.16s)]
*  they're able to understand. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4988.92s)]
*  There's things we can say here, [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4990.56s)]
*  but we can't say in this other place. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4991.84s)]
*  I have a five-year-old in kindergarten right now. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4993.56s)]
*  I don't know that she would really get [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4995.56s)]
*  to make the distinction. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4997.64s)]
*  I understand that, but eventually that information [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=4999.4400000000005s)]
*  is gonna get to her. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5002.12s)]
*  So it's like, when do you tell her Santa Claus isn't real? [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5003.32s)]
*  I just don't need her teacher thinking I'm a bad person. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5006.16s)]
*  I live in a small town. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5009.88s)]
*  I don't wanna be outcast. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5012.04s)]
*  She definitely shouldn't be saying it. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5013.5199999999995s)]
*  I gotta keep up appearances. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5015.24s)]
*  That's what I'm saying here. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5016.5599999999995s)]
*  I know that feeling. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5019.799999999999s)]
*  She definitely shouldn't be saying it. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5021.28s)]
*  Yeah, don't say it. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5023.0s)]
*  I don't say it when I'm around people [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5024.839999999999s)]
*  that I think are gonna be offended. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5026.2s)]
*  If I go over someone's house and I meet their parents [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5027.839999999999s)]
*  and their older folks are all gay, [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5029.799999999999s)]
*  what the fuck's going on, Bob? [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5031.32s)]
*  I don't do that. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5033.16s)]
*  How are you, sir? [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5034.0s)]

*  I'm not gonna name check. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5038.36s)]
*  I did an interview a little while ago, [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5039.44s)]
*  and they sent me a list of words [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5041.5199999999995s)]
*  that I wasn't allowed to say, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5043.52s)]
*  and it was fucking hilarious. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5044.36s)]
*  Well, what was that list that they gave [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5047.04s)]
*  of problematic new words, new phrases? [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5048.52s)]
*  I put that out there. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5051.08s)]
*  It was like, where was that from? [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5052.72s)]

*  Did you see that? [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5062.88s)]
*  The AP put out their style guide or whatever. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5063.72s)]
*  It was like, don't put the in front of a group. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5066.04s)]
*  It could be offensive. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5068.2s)]
*  It's othering. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5069.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's othering, and one of their examples was. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5069.88s)]
*  People with disabilities, the French. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5073.080000000001s)]

*  That is an affliction. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5081.280000000001s)]
*  Oh my God, university language guide. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5082.120000000001s)]

*  are problematic words. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5087.120000000001s)]
*  Spirit animal? [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5088.120000000001s)]
*  Spirit animal is a problematic word. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5088.96s)]

*  Grandfather? [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5093.240000000001s)]
*  I thought that spirit animal was just a, [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5094.320000000001s)]
*  well, listen, ninja is something you can't take from us. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5096.68s)]
*  Wait. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5101.120000000001s)]
*  From the martial arts community, [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5102.12s)]
*  you are not allowed to say that ninja is a pejorative [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5104.88s)]
*  because ninja is something that we like. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5108.04s)]
*  We will talk about a guy who's a jujitsu expert [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5109.92s)]
*  and like, dude, that motherfucker's a ninja. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5111.88s)]
*  It's a compliment. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5114.44s)]
*  That's a thing. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5115.28s)]
*  Okay, listen, I agree with you, [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5116.12s)]
*  but the one that I just can't even understand [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5118.52s)]
*  the rationalization of is grandfather. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5121.36s)]
*  I can imagine how a deranged mind [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5125.6s)]
*  would come up with these other ones. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5127.88s)]
*  Look what it says. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5129.12s)]
*  The clause originating in the American South in the 1890s [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5130.24s)]
*  is a way to defy the 15th Amendment [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5132.64s)]
*  and prevent black Americans from voting. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5134.44s)]
*  What? [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5136.24s)]
*  Oh, I see, because it was referred to [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5137.08s)]
*  as the grandfather clause. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5137.96s)]
*  But that means that the grandfather name [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5139.2s)]
*  was grandfathered into the grandfather clause. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5141.92s)]
*  So why get rid of that? [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5144.8s)]
*  Because the grandfather name, [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5145.64s)]
*  that's like way before that. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5146.48s)]
*  Why don't you just teach people what the grandfather clause is? [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5148.24s)]
*  Yeah, get rid of that stupid fucking clause. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5150.0s)]
*  Like don't get rid of the name grandfather. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5152.32s)]
*  That's so dumb. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5155.16s)]
*  There's so many more grandfathers [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5156.2s)]
*  than there are grandfather clauses. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5157.76s)]
*  There was another one, Jamie, I think you can look for, [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5160.6s)]
*  I think it was Stanford, and there was one [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5162.76s)]
*  that was around like Merritt or something like that. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5164.8s)]
*  Hold on, go back to that, [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5166.64s)]
*  because it said preferred pronouns are problematic. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5167.72s)]
*  Where were you right there? [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5170.8s)]
*  Yeah, here it goes, hold on. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5171.64s)]
*  The language guide also considers preferred pronouns [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5172.88s)]
*  as problematic because the term preferred [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5176.32s)]
*  suggests that a person's pronouns are optional. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5179.5599999999995s)]
*  So what are you supposed to say? [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5182.32s)]
*  Mandatory pronouns. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5184.12s)]
*  Your pronouns. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5186.08s)]
*  Follow the rules or die. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5187.72s)]
*  I like this one, phrases with man, manpower. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5190.200000000001s)]
*  Oh yes, that's so silly. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5193.360000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, that maybe, maybe you can make an argument [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5195.0s)]
*  for that if you're working at a 50-50 fucking workplace. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5200.240000000001s)]
*  Even a 90-10 workplace, and 10% of them are women. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5203.400000000001s)]
*  Like man hours, like what about human hours? [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5206.64s)]
*  You can say human hours. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5209.0s)]
*  Sure you can. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5210.08s)]
*  You could. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5210.92s)]
*  That's not an issue. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5211.76s)]
*  Yeah, but are you really taking offense at that? [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5212.6s)]
*  But grandfather, leave grandpa alone. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5213.42s)]
*  Yeah, come on. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5215.56s)]
*  What the fuck are we doing? [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5216.88s)]
*  But the thing is, is like once people get things established, [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5220.4800000000005s)]
*  they never will stop. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5223.88s)]
*  Like we're good, we have a perfect balance in society. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5224.84s)]
*  No, they wanna keep pushing. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5227.280000000001s)]
*  And if they're pushing in that general direction [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5229.0s)]
*  to try to restrict language, define what's acceptable. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5231.4800000000005s)]
*  You're right though that it is such a bipartisan instinct. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5234.88s)]
*  It's much more about control than it is anything else. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5237.72s)]
*  Because we see like, you know, the right I think [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5241.400000000001s)]
*  very strategically has embraced like the narrative [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5243.64s)]
*  of like freedom of speech, et cetera. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5246.4800000000005s)]
*  And then you see dudes like Mike Lindell, the pillow guy, [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5249.96s)]
*  starting his own social media platform. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5252.08s)]
*  And he's like, it's a free speech platform. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5254.0s)]
*  No curse words allowed, no taking the Lord's name in vain. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5256.44s)]
*  What about porn? [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5259.96s)]
*  No porn, definitely no porn. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5261.0s)]
*  That's the crazy thing about Twitter. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5261.84s)]
*  Twitter still has hardcore porn. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5262.679999999999s)]
*  Which is really weird. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5265.4s)]
*  They honestly do a pretty good job I feel like of keeping it. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5266.639999999999s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5269.5199999999995s)]
*  What does the show mean? [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5270.36s)]
*  Exactly, that's what I mean. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5271.2s)]
*  Is like if you aren't there for like. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5272.88s)]
*  Right, if you're not following. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5274.5199999999995s)]
*  Dicks and asses, you're not gonna get it in your feet. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5275.5199999999995s)]
*  And if you are, then you are. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5277.92s)]
*  I saw somebody tweeted us once, [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5279.76s)]
*  they're like, love crystal ball and soccer. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5280.84s)]
*  I was like, oh, who is this guy? [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5282.28s)]
*  I show up, it's just a giant dick in my face. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5283.28s)]
*  He's like a male form. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5285.24s)]
*  He's a male form, I love that guy. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5286.08s)]
*  I was like, all right. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5286.92s)]
*  I love that guy, shout out to him. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5287.76s)]
*  They're political too. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5289.44s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5290.28s)]
*  They gotta fight for their rights [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5291.8s)]
*  maybe more than anyone else. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5292.84s)]
*  Just because you fuck on camera [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5293.84s)]
*  doesn't mean you're not a person. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5294.96s)]
*  Right, yeah. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5296.04s)]
*  It's a wild time to be alive. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5299.84s)]
*  But that's why I think that a show like yours [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5302.12s)]
*  is so important. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5303.64s)]
*  Because you are from the right, you are from the left. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5304.48s)]
*  I think I'm like a person without a country. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5307.200000000001s)]
*  I'm an island, I really do. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5309.76s)]
*  I'm so left wing on so many different things. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5311.8s)]
*  But then they get to a certain number of things [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5314.4800000000005s)]
*  and I'm like, no fucking way, stop. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5316.320000000001s)]
*  Because you're denying crazy, [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5318.6s)]
*  you're denying all sorts of real psychological conditions. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5320.76s)]
*  Amid backlash, Stanford pulls harmful language. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5324.64s)]
*  Amid backlash, duh guys, get out of your fucking bubble. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5327.320000000001s)]
*  Those are people that need to read the comments. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5331.120000000001s)]
*  Sometimes people shouldn't, [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5333.320000000001s)]
*  but Stanford should read the comments. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5334.320000000001s)]
*  They should read the comments. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5335.2s)]
*  I think there's a lot of people who feel like you do, Joe. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5337.24s)]
*  Where they just don't, I mean, we both feel the same way [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5339.5199999999995s)]
*  you do in terms of like, you know, I don't see myself [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5343.4s)]
*  as like fitting with the Democratic Party [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5345.76s)]
*  and everything that they're doing. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5347.639999999999s)]
*  I just saw like Nancy Pelosi is endorsing Adam Schiff [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5349.24s)]
*  for California Senate. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5352.2s)]
*  When you read through the way that man lied [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5353.32s)]
*  to the American public through all of Russiagate, [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5354.92s)]

*  She's talking about money. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5371.92s)]
*  She shouldn't have apologized. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5372.759999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'll go ahead and say it. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5373.759999999999s)]
*  That's not an anti-Semitic statement. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5374.599999999999s)]

*  It's about, Benjamins are money. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5376.799999999999s)]
*  You know, the idea that Jewish people [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5378.44s)]
*  are not into money is ridiculous. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5380.32s)]
*  Listen. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5381.88s)]
*  That's like saying Italians aren't into pizza. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5382.719999999999s)]
*  It's fucking stupid. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5384.96s)]
*  Listen. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5386.08s)]
*  It's fucking stupid. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5386.92s)]
*  I understand that the way she phrased it, [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5387.759999999999s)]
*  like she could have phrased it a different way [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5391.16s)]
*  so that people would have less of a freak out. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5393.24s)]
*  But can you not talk about the influence of money in DC? [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5395.719999999999s)]
*  Of course. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5400.28s)]
*  I mean, this is very obvious. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5401.12s)]
*  There's a very obvious reason why for my entire life, [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5401.96s)]
*  there's been a uniparty consensus around our policy [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5406.5599999999995s)]
*  vis-a-vis the Israeli government [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5410.16s)]
*  and a total inability or unwillingness [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5411.8s)]
*  to criticize the Israeli government. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5413.679999999999s)]
*  And it has everything to do with organization and yes, money. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5415.639999999999s)]
*  Just like every other fucking interest in DC. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5419.5199999999995s)]
*  And so yeah, the fact that she said that [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5422.4s)]
*  and she got kicked off the foreign affairs committee. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5424.08s)]
*  Look, I have issues and disagreements with Ilhan Omar, [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5425.5599999999995s)]
*  but she actually is one of the more courageous voices [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5428.679999999999s)]
*  on foreign policy who's willing to call out [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5431.4s)]
*  some of the hypocrisy and bullshit in US foreign policy. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5433.28s)]
*  Extremely rare in terms of United States congressmen. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5436.639999999999s)]
*  So it's actually kind of a real loss [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5439.679999999999s)]
*  that she got kicked off that committee. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5441.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, she, whether you agree with her or not, [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5442.5199999999995s)]
*  she has a bold opinion and that opinion is not her own. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5444.679999999999s)]
*  There's many people that have that opinion [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5447.719999999999s)]
*  and they should be represented. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5449.44s)]
*  My point is she's sitting right next to Adam Schiff [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5451.0s)]
*  and no one says shit. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5453.44s)]
*  She doesn't say, yeah, yeah, I probably should have said, [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5455.8s)]
*  hey motherfucker, what did you say? [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5457.76s)]
*  Right, yes. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5459.52s)]
*  You said some crazy shit that wasn't true at all. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5460.84s)]
*  No, he was the, I mean, he loved having his face [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5463.16s)]
*  on the cameras during all the Russian stuff. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5467.04s)]
*  And he would go out there and just like go right up [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5469.32s)]
*  to the line of basically saying, [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5472.04s)]
*  yeah, we got the goods on Trump and Russia. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5473.6s)]
*  Oh boy. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5475.24s)]
*  And he fed it so hard. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5476.08s)]
*  And then you look at that and what a disservice it was, [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5478.76s)]
*  what a like giant elaborate conspiracy was constructed [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5482.2s)]
*  to distract the American people [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5486.4800000000005s)]
*  from so many more important things that were going on. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5487.8s)]
*  And here's one of the key figures. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5490.16s)]
*  And he is very likely to be the next Senator from California, [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5492.320000000001s)]
*  especially with fucking Nancy Pelosi's endorsement now. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5496.240000000001s)]
*  Insane. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5498.52s)]
*  It's fucking ridiculous. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5499.360000000001s)]
*  And no, I agree. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5500.2s)]
*  It's also funny in terms of like, [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5501.04s)]
*  what are you're not allowed to say, [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5502.16s)]
*  what you get censored off of a committee for. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5503.12s)]
*  Like you said, look, I don't agree with Ilhan Omar on a lot. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5505.240000000001s)]
*  I also don't think that it should be out of bounds [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5508.32s)]
*  to talk about influence of any government, [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5510.28s)]
*  including the Saudi government, [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5512.52s)]
*  of which a lot of these people are on the take on. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5514.52s)]
*  This is just hypocrisy, which drives me fucking crazy. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5516.96s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5519.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, they'll censor, [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5520.32s)]
*  or they'll go after Eric Swalwell, [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5522.16s)]
*  rightfully in my opinion, right? [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5523.4800000000005s)]
*  What did he do? [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5524.96s)]
*  Okay, he had a relationship of some kind with a Chinese spy. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5526.36s)]
*  He basically slept with a Chinese spy. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5529.84s)]
*  It may not have been. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5531.56s)]
*  He says it was not. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5532.400000000001s)]
*  And this was apparently before he was married. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5534.6s)]
*  And he says he had no idea. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5537.32s)]
*  So your name was Fang Fang? [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5539.16s)]
*  No idea, she was a Chinese spy. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5540.5199999999995s)]
*  Jamie, I'm sure you can find a picture of her. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5542.32s)]
*  There's a picture of the two of them together. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5543.68s)]
*  You got a hot sext from Fang Fang? [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5545.04s)]
*  What'd he gotta do? [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5547.28s)]
*  You meet her at a conference, you're a fucking nerd, [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5548.12s)]
*  you're the weirdo who always wants to be a congressman. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5549.44s)]
*  She's in a lingerie in front of a mirror. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5551.28s)]
*  I mean, who among us? [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5552.5199999999995s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5554.4s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5555.639999999999s)]
*  As long as I don't tell her any secrets. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5556.48s)]
*  Who gives a shit? [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5559.0s)]
*  No harm, no foul. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5559.84s)]
*  No harm, no foul. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5560.68s)]
*  No harm, no foul. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5561.5199999999995s)]
*  There she is. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5562.36s)]
*  Look at him and look at her. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5564.2s)]
*  Let's go champ. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5565.28s)]
*  He looks like a fucking dork. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5566.12s)]
*  Of course he did. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5567.8s)]
*  She had intentionally, I think my recollection is, [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5569.0s)]
*  infiltrated a bunch of San Francisco [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5571.8s)]
*  democratic donor circuits. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5574.84s)]
*  The crazy thing is she's like a seven. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5576.68s)]
*  Imagine if they brought her aboard on their bombshells. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5578.24s)]
*  She was probably the early ones. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5580.04s)]
*  Listen. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5581.76s)]
*  You know how the Russians send out the first [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5582.6s)]
*  fucking group of people to die? [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5583.8s)]
*  If you're a seven and you know how to stroke [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5585.72s)]
*  a congressman's ego, you're gonna be fine. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5587.28s)]
*  Oh yeah, especially with a couple of cocktails. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5589.32s)]
*  Yeah, you didn't need to send in a 10. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5591.68s)]
*  Probably better, you trust a seven. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5594.72s)]
*  She's a regular guy. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5597.280000000001s)]
*  It was like Maria Bertina. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5598.120000000001s)]
*  She was like the Russian one. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5598.96s)]
*  She seduced a bunch of NRA members. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5601.120000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5603.96s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5604.8s)]
*  It was like 2018. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5605.64s)]
*  We actually exchanged her. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5606.4800000000005s)]
*  She's back in Moscow. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5607.4800000000005s)]
*  She's like we did a prison stage for her. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5608.6s)]
*  Yeah and now isn't she like a lawmaker now? [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5610.360000000001s)]
*  There she is. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5614.080000000001s)]
*  I'm pretty sure she's a lawmaker now. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5614.92s)]
*  Yeah you're right. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5616.120000000001s)]
*  I think she was elected to the Duma or something like that. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5616.96s)]
*  So what did she do to the NRA people? [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5618.6s)]
*  She would go to a bunch of CPAC and NRA conferences [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5620.88s)]
*  and ingratiate herself with GOP officials [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5624.16s)]
*  and then she would sleep with them [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5626.92s)]
*  and then basically try and get as close to Trump as possible. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5628.36s)]
*  There's a lot of governments that do this. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5632.5199999999995s)]
*  The Israeli government does this, [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5634.5599999999995s)]
*  the Russian government, the Chinese government. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5635.92s)]
*  What was she trying to do? [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5637.48s)]
*  What was her goal? [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5638.5199999999995s)]
*  It's all like soft power stuff. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5639.36s)]
*  I think a lot of it's related to trying [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5640.599999999999s)]
*  to getting sanctions off of certain oligarchs. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5642.08s)]
*  That's where a lot of it comes back. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5644.48s)]
*  She was in a real long term ultimately relationship [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5645.92s)]
*  with somebody high up in the NRA. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5651.28s)]
*  NRA don't, something like that. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5653.799999999999s)]
*  She was living with him. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5655.839999999999s)]
*  The idea was to get close to power I guess basically. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5658.5199999999995s)]
*  I never saw the Americans. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5661.08s)]
*  Oh great, fuck, great. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5662.719999999999s)]
*  That's all I heard. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5664.879999999999s)]
*  Same thing. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5665.719999999999s)]
*  I didn't watch it either. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5666.5599999999995s)]
*  But it's same thing, right? [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5667.4s)]
*  It was like Russian spies that were integrated. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5668.219999999999s)]
*  Tell me we don't do that. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5671.5599999999995s)]
*  Of course we do. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5672.879999999999s)]
*  Of course we do. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5673.719999999999s)]
*  100%. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5674.5599999999995s)]
*  100%. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5675.4s)]
*  It's a dirty world. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5676.24s)]
*  They're fools aren't they? [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5677.44s)]
*  They're doing it. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5678.839999999999s)]
*  Why would you not? [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5679.679999999999s)]
*  I mean that's the argument [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5680.799999999999s)]
*  kicking Chinese companies out of America. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5681.96s)]
*  They don't let us do it. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5684.320000000001s)]
*  You know why too? [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5686.16s)]
*  If you look at it, they explicitly, [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5687.0s)]
*  when they banned Google, Facebook and all that, [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5688.28s)]
*  they're like they're gonna use it [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5689.92s)]
*  to shape our population and spy on us. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5690.76s)]
*  Why would we do that? [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5692.2s)]
*  And then we're like yeah let's get TikTok on in here. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5693.04s)]
*  Well not only that, [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5695.4400000000005s)]
*  let's let them fly a fucking balloon over the country. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5696.360000000001s)]
*  It's crazy right? [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5699.2s)]
*  Let's get on with the spy balloon. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5700.04s)]
*  I mean the funny thing is, [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5701.320000000001s)]
*  it really is like it's such a shell game [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5703.04s)]
*  because we know they're spying on us. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5705.12s)]
*  They know we're spying on them. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5708.12s)]
*  But you can't be so fucking obvious about it [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5709.76s)]
*  where your spy balloon is there [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5712.12s)]
*  and a commercial airline jet is like spotting it. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5713.4800000000005s)]
*  And so you can't be so obvious. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5716.280000000001s)]
*  But it's floating around. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5718.64s)]
*  Does it have power? [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5720.6s)]
*  Well so I don't know, [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5721.6s)]
*  but it was spotted actually over [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5722.4400000000005s)]
*  one of the three sites in the United States [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5724.88s)]
*  which has intercontinental ballistic missiles. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5726.76s)]
*  And of course it just happened to fly there [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5728.84s)]
*  and it would drift it off of course [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5730.8s)]
*  according to the Chinese government. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5732.08s)]
*  But like we already knew that their spy satellites [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5733.360000000001s)]
*  are able to like see this area [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5737.04s)]
*  and collect whatever data there is to collect. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5739.8s)]
*  So what's the purpose of balloons? [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5742.32s)]
*  That's a great question. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5744.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5745.16s)]
*  That's a great question. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5745.98s)]
*  Just to stick it in your face? [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5746.82s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5747.64s)]
*  It's like when, [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5748.48s)]
*  you remember when Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5749.32s)]
*  and China just shot a bunch of missiles into the ocean, [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5750.44s)]
*  killed some dolphins? [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5753.16s)]
*  Yeah, I think that was wildly irresponsible [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5754.0s)]
*  of her to go though. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5756.28s)]
*  I mean especially at the state department [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5757.12s)]
*  and Biden, they were like don't do this. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5759.28s)]
*  I did a joke about it. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5760.12s)]
*  What'd you say? [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5761.44s)]
*  I was like I think they're trying to kill that lady. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5762.28s)]
*  She's making too much money. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5763.52s)]
*  You're like send her over there. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5764.6s)]
*  They're like Nancy, go on. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5765.44s)]
*  You're fucking up for everybody. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5766.599999999999s)]
*  We've got a special trip for you. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5767.44s)]
*  You're stealing too much money. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5768.28s)]
*  What does it say there, Jamie? [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5770.04s)]
*  They don't care about that, Joe. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5771.32s)]
*  The balloon has the ability to maneuver [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5772.4s)]
*  and had changed course. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5774.28s)]
*  Oh, terrific. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5775.48s)]
*  Well how did it drift off course then [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5776.32s)]
*  if they have the ability to maneuver? [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5777.36s)]
*  Change course. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5778.92s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5779.759999999999s)]
*  I mean it didn't drift off course. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5780.599999999999s)]
*  It seems like it's under its own power. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5781.88s)]
*  So that's the worry about shooting it down [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5784.08s)]
*  was the payload, like it's large. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5787.28s)]
*  The worry was that there would be debris [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5789.44s)]
*  that would hurt the civilian population. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5792.5199999999995s)]
*  And then the other thing I saw was that [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5794.8s)]
*  they actually wanted to be able to observe it more [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5798.400000000001s)]
*  and see what it was and capabilities and whatever. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5801.6s)]
*  It might be more useful to it in the sky [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5803.6s)]
*  than shot up into abilities. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5805.8s)]
*  Well the Avengers have a net they could shoot out of a jet. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5807.12s)]
*  You're telling me United States doesn't have a net? [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5809.4400000000005s)]
*  They shouldn't have a net shit. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5810.28s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5811.4400000000005s)]
*  That's a compromised position. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5812.28s)]
*  I like that. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5813.400000000001s)]
*  What scares me about this is I don't even, [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5814.24s)]
*  so did you hear about the circumstance of why it was found? [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5816.0s)]
*  Because a commercial airline pilot is the one who saw it. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5818.320000000001s)]
*  And so I'm like well did we know it was there [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5821.24s)]
*  before the pilot called it? [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5823.8s)]
*  He was probably so bummed out, [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5824.64s)]
*  he was probably hoping it was a UFO. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5825.46s)]
*  Oh I know. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5826.3s)]
*  Please let it be a UFO. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5827.14s)]
*  I'm still holding my phone. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5830.04s)]
*  He's like Joe Rogan's gonna have me on [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5831.56s)]
*  to talk about this. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5832.92s)]
*  This is gonna be great. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5833.76s)]
*  Well we were at 35,000 feet. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5835.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5837.320000000001s)]
*  That's too obvious though, it's too obvious. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5838.160000000001s)]
*  It was too rudimentary technology. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5842.68s)]
*  Well I always wonder about what those things are [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5843.52s)]
*  that people keep spotting. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5845.56s)]
*  I mean we don't really totally know [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5846.8s)]
*  about their capabilities. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5848.84s)]
*  As you know I go quite deep on this. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5850.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5853.84s)]
*  Do you go deep on it at all Crystal [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5854.68s)]
*  or do you just roll your eyes [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5855.96s)]
*  when he starts talking to you up close? [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5856.92s)]
*  I don't roll my eyes. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5857.76s)]
*  She just grabbed her drink. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5859.4s)]
*  That's an instinct. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5861.24s)]
*  I don't roll my eyes. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5862.4s)]
*  I just, it's not like, I don't go deep the way he does. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5865.08s)]
*  I find it interesting. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5868.02s)]
*  I find it question mark. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5869.32s)]
*  But I can't say I've gone deep down the rabbit hole [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5871.64s)]

*  My friend Essie Cup who we had on the screen earlier, [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5929.58s)]
*  I wouldn't say she's a Sasquatch expert, [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5932.58s)]

*  Of course. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5936.34s)]

*  I don't think it's fair to put Sasquatch [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5939.26s)]

*  100% is. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5942.06s)]

*  I just think there's a lot more evidence on the UFO side. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5950.66s)]
*  I mean- [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5953.1s)]
*  Yes there is, but there's also evidence [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5953.9400000000005s)]
*  that there was an animal that was a bipedal hominid [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5955.58s)]
*  that lived alongside of human beings. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5958.06s)]
*  Oh interesting. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5960.26s)]
*  An enormous one. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5961.1s)]
*  An enormous one. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5961.9400000000005s)]
*  It's called Gigantopithecus. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5962.76s)]
*  It's absolutely real. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5964.38s)]
*  In the Pacific Northwest? [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5965.780000000001s)]
*  Well it was in Asia. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5967.1s)]
*  And this was during the time before the ice age [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5968.46s)]
*  when the Bering land bridge was available. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5970.34s)]
*  There was an animal that they discovered [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5972.42s)]
*  in an apothecary shop in China, [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5974.9s)]
*  and I believe it was in the 1920s. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5976.86s)]
*  An anthropologist was there, [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5978.5s)]
*  and he found these enormous primate teeth. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5980.06s)]
*  I might be fucking this up. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5982.14s)]
*  I don't think I am though. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5984.06s)]
*  He found these enormous primate teeth, [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5985.3s)]
*  and he was like, what the fuck is this? [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5987.1s)]
*  And where'd you get this? [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5989.26s)]
*  And it led to an investigation. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5990.94s)]
*  They found the site where these things were recovered, [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5992.94s)]
*  and they found more. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5994.82s)]
*  And they found jaw bones that would indicate [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5995.86s)]
*  that this animal's bipedal. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=5999.0599999999995s)]
*  Which means it stood up on two legs, [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6000.66s)]
*  and it was fucking enormous. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6002.5s)]
*  Like eight foot tall, gorilla-like, orangutan-like creature [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6004.46s)]
*  that existed alongside human beings. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6009.179999999999s)]
*  Okay, but we don't know exactly, [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6011.34s)]
*  like when did the teeth or jaw bone or whatever? [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6012.78s)]
*  We know for a fact that they existed 100,000 years ago [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6014.139999999999s)]
*  because of these bones. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6017.54s)]
*  But that doesn't mean they didn't exist 50,000 years ago, [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6018.94s)]
*  or 10,000 years ago. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6021.62s)]
*  We don't know. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6023.42s)]
*  And if they did exist 10,000 years ago, [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6024.38s)]
*  it makes sense why the Native Americans [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6026.26s)]
*  would have many, many names for these creatures. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6028.74s)]
*  And they didn't really have mythical creatures. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6031.86s)]
*  That's what a gigantopithecus would have looked like. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6034.42s)]
*  Jesus, wow. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6038.02s)]
*  So it was an enormous great ape that lived alongside us [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6039.06s)]
*  and absolutely 100,000 years ago. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6044.34s)]
*  And then they found many other creatures [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6047.18s)]
*  that were really interesting that we didn't know existed [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6050.02s)]
*  that absolutely lived alongside human beings. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6052.86s)]
*  One of them was the hobbit man from the island of Flores. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6055.54s)]
*  So that's homo florescis. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6058.54s)]
*  That was Indonesia, I believe. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6061.38s)]
*  Didn't they have some local lore also about that? [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6063.219999999999s)]
*  Like the elders had some connectivity [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6067.0199999999995s)]
*  to when that species existed alongside of them? [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6070.099999999999s)]
*  Yes, they called the orang pendek. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6073.58s)]
*  And by the way, Hawaii has a similar legend. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6076.0199999999995s)]
*  I talked to a gentleman in Hawaii [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6079.219999999999s)]
*  when I was there recently, and he was just an old timer. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6081.74s)]
*  He was great. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6084.78s)]
*  And he was telling me all the different names [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6085.62s)]
*  that the Native Hawaiians have for things. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6087.62s)]
*  And he was explaining how there was a creature [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6090.139999999999s)]
*  that supposedly lived when the first people got here. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6092.139999999999s)]
*  And it was a small, hairy, ape-like creature [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6096.46s)]
*  that is similar to what's been spotted in Vietnam [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6099.76s)]
*  and in other parts of the world in these jungle areas [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6102.98s)]
*  they call it the orang pendek. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6105.9s)]
*  And it's identical to this hobbit person. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6107.54s)]
*  So when they existed, who knows? [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6111.02s)]
*  They might have existed 500 years ago [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6113.14s)]
*  or 100 years ago or 50 years ago. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6115.14s)]
*  We don't fucking know. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6117.120000000001s)]
*  But we do know that there were a bunch of different kinds [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6118.46s)]
*  of ape-like creatures that existed alongside of us. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6122.540000000001s)]
*  And they think that these homo florescis [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6126.540000000001s)]
*  were really like close to human. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6128.9800000000005s)]
*  They were like on a branch, like they'll use tools. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6130.740000000001s)]
*  They hunted, they worked together [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6134.06s)]
*  and they might've communicated. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6136.06s)]
*  They might've had a language. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6137.120000000001s)]
*  Like we don't know. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6138.22s)]
*  See, this is why I think it all connects to UFOs [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6139.14s)]
*  where it's like, I just gotta, I gotta, [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6141.34s)]
*  I can't imagine but stepping back and dreaming of like Earth. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6143.22s)]
*  We don't even know what it looked like 2,500 BC. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6146.9800000000005s)]
*  Beyond that, we have no idea. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6150.06s)]
*  That's when written history begins. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6151.18s)]
*  You've talked a lot with Graham Hancock [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6152.820000000001s)]
*  his ancient apocalypse series. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6154.240000000001s)]
*  And the reason why I think there's a connectivity [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6155.860000000001s)]
*  is like, what's possible, man? [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6157.5s)]
*  That's what the UFO thing. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6159.3s)]
*  I'm like, if there's ancient life here [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6160.34s)]
*  or multiple forms of alien life [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6162.9400000000005s)]
*  or some connectivity between that [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6165.18s)]
*  or even past contact of all this, [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6167.3s)]
*  our entire understanding of the world [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6169.259999999999s)]
*  is just completely wrong. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6171.099999999999s)]
*  And I just find that so seductive, I guess, that idea. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6172.16s)]
*  Maybe that's foolish and maybe that's part, [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6176.54s)]
*  like a male thing, like you're talking about, [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6178.74s)]
*  but there's enough there that we can't help [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6180.78s)]
*  but be interested in what's happening. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6183.139999999999s)]
*  You just persuaded Sager [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6185.38s)]
*  he was just shitting on the Sasquatch people [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6186.42s)]
*  and now he's like all in. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6188.099999999999s)]
*  Well, it definitely existed. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6188.94s)]
*  I'm talking more about homo florentis [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6189.78s)]
*  and the idea that there was a human civilization [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6191.099999999999s)]
*  like a million years ago. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6193.259999999999s)]
*  The Sasquatch is more likely [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6194.099999999999s)]
*  because it definitely existed. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6196.42s)]
*  They know that within the time that human beings were alive, [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6198.18s)]
*  we're gonna have stories about this creature. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6201.06s)]
*  Now, whether or not those stories persist [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6202.900000000001s)]
*  long after the creature is extinct [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6205.14s)]
*  and people pretend they see it [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6206.66s)]
*  when they're really just seeing black bears [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6208.18s)]
*  that are walking upright, which they do all the time. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6209.860000000001s)]
*  I've seen black bears walk upright. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6212.62s)]
*  And if black bears have a hurt paw, [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6214.66s)]
*  there was a black bear, a famous black bear in New Jersey [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6216.62s)]
*  that had a hurt, it had very badly damaged front paw [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6219.56s)]
*  so it would walk on its rear legs. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6223.58s)]
*  It would walk upright like a seven foot tall animal. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6225.86s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6228.74s)]
*  Which is just like, if you saw it through the trees, [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6229.58s)]
*  you'd be like, oh my God, it's a giant ape. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6231.42s)]
*  I saw one in Glacier National Park [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6232.54s)]
*  and I was like, holy fuck, these things are so big. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6234.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't think people really know how big bears are. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6236.58s)]
*  Bears are big. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6238.58s)]
*  Well, if Glacier National Park, [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6239.42s)]
*  was it a brown bear or a black bear? [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6240.62s)]
*  Yeah, it was a black bear and a brown bear. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6242.0199999999995s)]
*  I saw both, I got really lucky. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6243.219999999999s)]
*  We were in Montana and we were at this grizzly preserve [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6244.54s)]
*  and where they'd taken these problematic grizzlies [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6248.34s)]
*  that like raid people's garbage and shit. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6250.98s)]
*  They said grandfather. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6252.86s)]
*  Well they. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6253.82s)]
*  Well they. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6254.66s)]
*  Ah! [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6255.5s)]
*  Yeah, and they fed this thing a frozen watermelon [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6260.78s)]
*  and this bear crushed this frozen watermelon [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6264.94s)]
*  like it was a grape. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6268.4s)]
*  Like you and I would do a grape. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6269.5s)]
*  It's just. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6270.62s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6271.46s)]
*  Just took giant bites out of a frozen watermelon. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6272.299999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6274.74s)]
*  And I was like, imagine the power of this fucking thing. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6275.58s)]
*  They're so big. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6279.0599999999995s)]
*  You ever seen a jaguar? [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6280.54s)]
*  Not in the live. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6281.66s)]
*  Yeah, I only saw one in a zoo, [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6282.74s)]
*  but I mean they are some of the most majestic creatures. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6283.98s)]
*  You know about El Jefe? [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6286.42s)]
*  No, I don't. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6287.9s)]
*  El Jefe is the only jaguar in the United States [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6288.719999999999s)]
*  that's been spotted in the United States. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6290.66s)]
*  They used to be prevalent. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6291.92s)]
*  Yeah, when the pioneers came across the country, [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6292.94s)]
*  they spotted multiple jaguars. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6294.98s)]
*  They were everywhere. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6296.54s)]
*  There's even sightings of jaguars in the northern states, [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6297.38s)]
*  but for whatever reason, [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6301.38s)]
*  they either were wiped out or whatever happened, [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6303.66s)]
*  but there's a jaguar that keeps traveling from Mexico [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6306.179999999999s)]
*  and that's El Jefe. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6310.219999999999s)]
*  There he is. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6311.219999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6312.06s)]
*  There's photos of him. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6312.900000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6313.740000000001s)]
*  Look at him. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6314.580000000001s)]
*  Look at that fucking beautiful thing. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6315.42s)]
*  I wonder how long jaguars live for, [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6317.860000000001s)]
*  like with their natural life span. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6319.700000000001s)]
*  Well, they know this one jaguar [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6321.02s)]
*  because they've taken so many trail cam photos of it. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6322.54s)]
*  Their spots are, you can identify them from their spots [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6325.42s)]
*  if you get still photos of high resolution. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6328.68s)]
*  It's like a fingerprint kind of thing. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6329.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6330.9400000000005s)]
*  And this one jaguar is just this lone 200 pound cat [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6331.780000000001s)]
*  that makes his way through and he's just fucking up deer. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6335.660000000001s)]
*  That is wild. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6338.3s)]
*  That is wild. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6339.3s)]
*  It's an amazing, amazing animal. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6340.14s)]
*  If there's only one. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6342.42s)]
*  If they're everywhere, you're fucked. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6343.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6344.099999999999s)]
*  Nice to watch it on the camera. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6344.94s)]
*  Yeah, otherwise you're like a tribe in the Amazon. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6346.3s)]
*  We go to get water, you're fucking terrified. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6349.0599999999995s)]
*  It's kind of like wolves. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6350.94s)]
*  Like we've ever seen a wolf that's fucking huge, [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6351.78s)]
*  like gigantic, and you're like, man, that's pretty scary. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6353.74s)]
*  Well, we've eradicated them [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6356.26s)]
*  and then these fucking eco people, [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6357.66s)]
*  like we need to bring them back. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6359.3s)]
*  They're our friends. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6361.179999999999s)]
*  The wolves are amazing. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6363.0199999999995s)]
*  Until they're eating your family, [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6364.86s)]
*  until they're trying to get into your house. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6366.38s)]
*  In your livestock or whatever. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6367.98s)]
*  I have a buddy who lives in BC [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6369.42s)]
*  and he watched one kill a horse. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6371.9400000000005s)]
*  Wow. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6373.74s)]
*  A pack of wolves killed a horse. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6374.58s)]
*  So it was like late at night [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6377.38s)]
*  and they hear all this barking and barking [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6378.860000000001s)]
*  and they look out from his fucking bedroom window [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6380.900000000001s)]
*  to one of the stalls [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6383.860000000001s)]
*  and they see a pack of wolves devouring a horse. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6384.74s)]
*  Wow. Jesus. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6387.1s)]
*  They got really hungry and it was cold [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6387.9400000000005s)]
*  and they took a chance. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6389.66s)]
*  Wow. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6390.860000000001s)]
*  There was a story. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6391.7s)]
*  Sorry, do you remember this? [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6393.62s)]
*  There was this town in New Hampshire [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6394.82s)]
*  that super ideological libertarians took over [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6397.38s)]
*  and they moved to the town. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6402.18s)]
*  They voted themselves onto the town council [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6403.900000000001s)]
*  and they went about getting rid [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6406.54s)]
*  of every single regulation they possibly could, [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6408.5s)]
*  including the ones that had to do [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6412.26s)]
*  with the proper way to store your trash [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6414.42s)]
*  to avoid attracting bears. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6416.7s)]
*  I don't remember this. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6419.06s)]
*  You don't remember this? [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6421.18s)]
*  This made such an impression on me [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6422.02s)]
*  because it was such a tale of ideological arrogance. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6423.42s)]
*  They're like, oh, the free market will work it out. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6428.06s)]
*  Well, next thing you know, bears are coming into town, [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6430.06s)]
*  bears are mauling people. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6432.740000000001s)]
*  They have this whole massive bear mauling issue [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6434.7s)]
*  in this New Hampshire town because of their ideology. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6438.34s)]
*  Well, there's a similar situation in New Jersey. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6441.26s)]
*  In New Jersey, New Jersey has the most bears per capita [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6443.9800000000005s)]
*  of any place in the country, including Alaska. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6448.42s)]
*  Wow. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6452.22s)]
*  I think including Alaska, I'm pretty sure. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6453.06s)]
*  They have a ton of black bears. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6454.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's all black bears. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6455.740000000001s)]
*  But the governor ran on a platform [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6457.26s)]
*  of getting rid of the bear hunt [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6459.26s)]
*  because people think, most of these people [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6460.94s)]
*  that are in high population areas, [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6462.62s)]
*  they don't have encounters with bears. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6464.3s)]
*  They think of bears like, why would you wanna kill a bear, [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6465.58s)]
*  you fucking asshole? [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6467.46s)]
*  But meanwhile, these people are getting killed by bears. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6469.099999999999s)]
*  A student from Rutgers was killed by a bear [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6471.34s)]
*  and then they started seeing a giant uptick, [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6473.86s)]
*  200% uptick in human bear encounters [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6477.099999999999s)]
*  that were problematic. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6480.179999999999s)]
*  We've played this video many times of, [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6481.34s)]
*  what is it, Far Rockaway? [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6483.46s)]
*  Far Rockaway, New Jersey? [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6484.94s)]
*  Is that where it was? [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6486.22s)]
*  Where these fucking enormous bears are duking it out [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6487.42s)]
*  in a really suburban area. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6491.42s)]
*  Knocking over trash cans. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6494.22s)]
*  Far Rockaway is like New York City suburbs, right? [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6495.06s)]
*  Yeah, I thought that was like Queens or something. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6496.900000000001s)]
*  Is it Far Rockaway? [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6498.26s)]
*  No. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6499.1s)]
*  What is it, the, no. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6500.02s)]
*  It just sounds right. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6500.9800000000005s)]
*  It's New Jersey. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6502.42s)]
*  God damn it, why can't I remember it? [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6503.34s)]
*  We've played this clip. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6505.54s)]
*  It is Rockaway. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6507.02s)]
*  Okay, watch this, [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6508.02s)]
*  because it's fucking bonkers. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6509.54s)]
*  This is on people's, that's like, [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6511.900000000001s)]
*  these are two, 300 pound bears. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6513.62s)]
*  They're fucking huge. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6515.1s)]
*  They're like in your yard. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6515.900000000001s)]
*  100% of the yard, they're fighting over trash. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6517.02s)]
*  So what happens is they get, or maybe breeding, [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6520.580000000001s)]
*  they get access to the trash in the area [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6523.820000000001s)]
*  and when another male is there, [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6526.54s)]
*  they try to scare the male off. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6528.22s)]
*  And these two bears just start duking it out, [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6530.18s)]
*  and when they start duking it out, [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6533.3s)]
*  they're knocking over trash cans, [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6534.46s)]
*  they're piling out into the streets. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6536.620000000001s)]
*  So these people are in their cars filming this. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6538.14s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6540.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean, look at giant chunks of fur flying off of them. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6542.34s)]
*  These are huge bears. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6545.82s)]
*  These are giant predators that will 100% kill your dog, [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6547.339999999999s)]
*  100% kill your kids. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6550.58s)]
*  You leave a baby outside, the baby's dead, [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6552.54s)]
*  the bear eats it and runs away with it. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6555.259999999999s)]
*  They don't have any morals, they don't have any ethics, [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6556.98s)]
*  they're playing by a totally different set of rules [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6559.139999999999s)]
*  than you would imagine from a Disney movie. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6561.54s)]
*  But this is what happens when you don't control predators. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6563.86s)]
*  The wildlife conservationists have long been saying [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6567.7s)]
*  you have to keep these animals in check [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6571.98s)]
*  because it's bad for them, it's bad for the people, [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6573.7s)]
*  and the nutty people are like, [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6576.86s)]
*  yeah, but we're in their area. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6578.62s)]
*  But they don't understand, right where we are, [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6580.46s)]
*  the hill country, 200 years ago, probably in this spot, [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6582.9s)]
*  it was a bloodbath. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6586.42s)]
*  It was pure Comanche range versus rival Indian groups, [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6588.22s)]
*  complete slaughter for resources. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6594.099999999999s)]
*  I don't think people really get it. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6597.86s)]
*  It was like, even 150 years ago, [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6600.139999999999s)]
*  if you think about Buffalo and the range [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6602.82s)]
*  and the conquering of the Old West, [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6604.54s)]
*  I've read so many books about that time period [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6606.299999999999s)]
*  just because I'm so fascinated by it. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6608.54s)]
*  But that era of what it was like [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6609.98s)]
*  and what the actual West and the range and all that was, [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6612.42s)]
*  it was a dangerous place. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6616.299999999999s)]
*  I've read a lot about Theodore Roosevelt [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6617.66s)]
*  and some of his original encounters [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6619.259999999999s)]
*  on some of his hunting trips with bears and everything. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6621.66s)]
*  It's just completely, completely outrageous. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6625.139999999999s)]
*  Where's the arrowhead, Jamie, do you know where it is? [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6627.38s)]
*  It's missing. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6630.099999999999s)]
*  Oh, here it is. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6631.7s)]
*  We have an arrowhead from here. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6633.42s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6634.26s)]
*  So I have a friend who has a ranch out here [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6635.1s)]
*  and their ranch is overwhelmed with arrowheads. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6636.86s)]
*  Really? [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6641.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, they dig all the time and they find these things. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6641.86s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6644.46s)]
*  That was an absolute Native American arrowhead [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6645.3s)]
*  that they used either for war or they used it for hunting. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6649.58s)]
*  Aren't you not supposed to pick them up? [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6653.38s)]
*  I didn't pick it up. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6654.9s)]
*  It was a gift. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6655.74s)]
*  It was a gift from a friend. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6657.58s)]
*  But in Texas, I think the rules are a little bit different [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6658.82s)]
*  because it's their land. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6661.18s)]
*  I did find one on a hunting trip once in Nevada [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6663.1s)]
*  and I was informed that I was supposed to leave it behind. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6664.9400000000005s)]
*  I knew that was a law. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6667.18s)]
*  Because I looked for them before too [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6668.66s)]
*  and they're like, even if you find it, [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6669.78s)]
*  you just gotta put it back. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6671.14s)]
*  I'm a law breaker, bro. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6671.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6672.82s)]
*  If I find an arrowhead, that shit's mine. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6673.66s)]
*  What if? [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6675.3s)]
*  It's like, I'm not gonna leave it here [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6676.14s)]
*  for somebody else to pick up. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6677.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's true. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6678.3s)]
*  What do you think is the most difficult [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6679.38s)]
*  of the animals that you've hunted? [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6681.42s)]
*  Neil Guy. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6683.62s)]
*  I just hunted a Neil Guy recently. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6684.860000000001s)]
*  Which is a, it's an Indian animal [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6686.46s)]
*  that evolved around tigers [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6688.7s)]
*  and I've never seen an animal [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6690.94s)]
*  that runs so fast when you hit it. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6692.94s)]
*  I thought I shot this Neil Guy with a bow and arrow [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6695.74s)]
*  and it was a perfect shot. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6699.82s)]
*  And I was really sure that it was a perfect shot. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6701.42s)]
*  It was a 52 yard shot, centered my pin, [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6703.78s)]
*  watched the arrow hit it. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6706.74s)]
*  And that animal ran off like on a full sprint [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6707.94s)]
*  like it wasn't even remotely injured. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6711.339999999999s)]
*  And I was like, oh no. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6712.9s)]
*  Like what happened? [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6714.7s)]
*  And it ran 130 yards until it died. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6715.86s)]
*  At a full clip. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6718.62s)]
*  It's a whole football feeling. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6721.66s)]
*  Wait, what did they look like? [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6722.5s)]
*  I've never heard of that animal. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6723.54s)]
*  See if you can pull a photo of a Neil Guy. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6724.58s)]
*  Where was this shot? [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6726.3s)]
*  South Texas. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6727.38s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6728.219999999999s)]
*  So there's more Asian and exotic African animals [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6729.0599999999995s)]
*  in South Texas than often in Asia and in Africa. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6734.5s)]
*  There's some animals that are, [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6739.219999999999s)]
*  in their country are endangered. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6740.9s)]
*  But in Texas, they hunt them regularly. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6743.54s)]
*  That's a Neil Guy. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6745.54s)]
*  And that is an animal that evolved around tigers. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6746.74s)]
*  And those dudes, you can't get close to them. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6749.98s)]
*  And if you hit them, they run like there's nothing wrong. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6752.5s)]
*  Like that animal had an arrow that went through its vitals [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6756.099999999999s)]
*  in a perfect shot, passed through its body, [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6758.82s)]
*  went 30 yards past its body where I found the arrow. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6761.139999999999s)]
*  It's kind of built different, right? [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6764.219999999999s)]
*  Oh my God, it's a tank. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6765.86s)]
*  It's like a deer but like super juiced up. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6766.7s)]
*  They're tanks. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6769.7s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it was a perfect shot. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6771.299999999999s)]
*  The animal died. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6774.379999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6775.419999999999s)]
*  But they say that happens with rifles. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6776.259999999999s)]
*  They were telling me they shoot those with a 300 Win Mag [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6778.34s)]
*  and they have to have another one in the chamber [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6780.62s)]
*  because the guide will do a follow-up shot on the animal [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6782.1s)]
*  because they're so fucking tough [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6786.38s)]
*  because they evolved around tigers. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6787.860000000001s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6790.18s)]
*  So like the, everybody's like, [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6791.38s)]
*  well, I'll just live off the land. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6792.900000000001s)]
*  Like, good luck, bitch. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6794.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6795.860000000001s)]
*  You're gonna need a grocery store, motherfucker. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6796.7s)]
*  You're not designed for this. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6799.42s)]
*  That's kind of the scary part though [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6800.860000000001s)]
*  when you realize how unconnected you are. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6802.1s)]
*  Like if you don't have any skills. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6803.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6804.78s)]
*  I've been watching Last of Us and you know, [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6805.62s)]
*  I was fucking, the last episode just broke me. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6807.26s)]
*  People out there know. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6811.02s)]
*  No spoilers. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6811.860000000001s)]
*  I won't say anything. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6812.7s)]
*  I'll watch it like three years from now [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6813.74s)]
*  when it's outdated. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6815.38s)]
*  It's brutal. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6816.22s)]
*  Anyway, I was like, man, this is so, [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6817.06s)]
*  cause I listened to your Mike Glover episode [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6818.5s)]
*  and I was like, yeah, man, I gotta get prepared. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6820.02s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't know a fucking thing. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6821.42s)]
*  I'm like, what am I doing here? [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6822.5s)]
*  I don't know a thing and I've been doing it for 12 years. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6824.18s)]
*  I've been hunting for like, yeah, 11 years now. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6827.14s)]
*  Yeah, I'm still a rookie. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6829.820000000001s)]
*  It's one of those skills where you have to put it in [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6831.860000000001s)]
*  from a very early age. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6834.5s)]
*  And when you learn about indigenous tribes [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6836.0599999999995s)]
*  or I read a lot of history, like the Mongols [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6838.0199999999995s)]
*  and you're into as well, they start learning [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6839.9s)]
*  when they're like three or four years old. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6841.66s)]
*  Like they start pulling bows before they can, [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6842.98s)]
*  like barely when they can start walking. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6844.78s)]
*  So it becomes part of the actual culture itself. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6846.5s)]
*  And that level of skill, it's, I don't know [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6849.58s)]
*  if you could teach that at this point. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6851.9s)]
*  Oh, you could. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6853.099999999999s)]
*  100%. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6853.94s)]
*  Yeah, you could if people had to. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6854.78s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6856.219999999999s)]
*  People are so adaptable. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6857.0599999999995s)]
*  Like we were talking the other day [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6858.099999999999s)]
*  about people that live in the Congo [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6859.54s)]
*  that are working in these cobalt mines. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6861.0199999999995s)]
*  And I was like, you've got to imagine [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6862.86s)]
*  if this is what you were born into. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6865.1s)]
*  Because humans are so adaptable. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6866.42s)]
*  We're so accustomed to whatever we're accustomed to. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6868.700000000001s)]
*  And if you live there, you would do [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6871.700000000001s)]
*  what everyone else is doing because you would get by. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6873.700000000001s)]
*  And if you were born into a nomadic tribe [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6875.860000000001s)]
*  that traveled around and followed the buffalo, [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6878.5s)]
*  you would be hunting them the same way they did. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6880.54s)]
*  That's just what people do. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6882.860000000001s)]
*  We adapt. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6884.14s)]
*  And that's the whole idea behind Graham Hancock [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6885.06s)]
*  and Randall Carlson's theory about the restarting [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6889.54s)]
*  of human civilization is that we have achieved [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6893.0199999999995s)]
*  a very high level of sophistication, [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6895.7s)]
*  which explains the pyramids and Gobekli Tepe. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6897.66s)]
*  It explains all these immense stone structures [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6900.339999999999s)]
*  where they move stones with some unknown technology [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6903.0599999999995s)]
*  from as many as 500 miles away, [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6905.74s)]
*  thousand tons stones through the mountains. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6909.219999999999s)]
*  We have no idea how the fuck they did it. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6912.259999999999s)]
*  And then you go 5,000 years later and you have barbarians. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6914.139999999999s)]
*  And like what happened? [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6918.62s)]
*  Well, most likely a fucking natural disaster [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6919.86s)]
*  that forced people to figure out a way to adapt and overcome. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6922.3s)]
*  And I think that's one of the reasons why [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6925.9400000000005s)]
*  if we go back a few thousand years ago, [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6928.18s)]
*  you have these people with these brilliant minds [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6930.22s)]
*  that live these unbelievably barbaric lives. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6932.38s)]
*  And I think it's because they're the descendants of people [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6935.42s)]
*  that had to survive whatever was left over [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6938.02s)]
*  after the sophisticated civilization [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6940.5s)]
*  was hit by comments. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6942.14s)]
*  Crystal just bought me a copy of the Perry Reese map, [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6943.34s)]
*  that famous map, which was the Ottoman admiral [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6945.900000000001s)]
*  written like 1513. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6950.14s)]
*  I think he drew it and he based it off from the Library of Alexandria. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6951.74s)]
*  And it includes that 10,000 year old coastline of Antarctica. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6955.099999999999s)]
*  Pretty good Christmas gift. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6958.74s)]
*  It was a great Christmas gift. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6959.7s)]
*  I love that. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6961.5s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6962.22s)]
*  And the more evidence that gets uncovered, [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6963.3s)]
*  the more that's a very viable theory because of core samples. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6965.54s)]
*  The hard physical data of those core samples [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6970.62s)]
*  shows that somewhere in the neighborhood of 12,800 years ago, [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6973.94s)]
*  there was massive impacts all over the earth, [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6977.54s)]
*  as much as 30% of the earth shows evidence of this. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6980.7s)]
*  30% of the earth shows evidence of iridium in high levels, [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6983.9s)]
*  which is very rare on earth, but very common in space. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6986.86s)]
*  Nano diamonds from the impact, carbon from burnt everything. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6989.62s)]
*  I think people got fucked up somewhere around 12,800 years ago, [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6993.94s)]
*  the end of the Ice Age. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6997.94s)]
*  And I think those guys are right. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=6999.22s)]
*  I think the more data that gets uncovered, [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7000.46s)]
*  which is like almost every day, [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7002.86s)]
*  they're finding new discoveries that point to that. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7004.54s)]
*  They're finding new impact craters. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7006.82s)]
*  They found a giant impact crater in Antarctica. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7008.7s)]
*  They found a giant one off the coast of New Zealand. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7010.82s)]
*  We get hit. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7013.98s)]
*  And when we get hit, all bets are off. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7015.22s)]
*  All your fucking hard drives are useless. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7017.58s)]
*  All the known knowledge that you get off the internet [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7019.58s)]
*  is no longer available to you. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7021.94s)]
*  And we start from scratch. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7023.82s)]
*  And that is a 100% possibility for us right now. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7025.22s)]
*  Right now, we're fearful of sort of the other direction. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7029.66s)]
*  But have you played with the chat GPT stuff, [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7033.98s)]
*  like the AI that's gonna, I don't know, [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7037.3s)]
*  revolutionize everything? [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7040.9400000000005s)]
*  Or will it? We don't know. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7042.42s)]
*  Yeah, that's the question, right? [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7043.26s)]
*  We've been playing with it. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7045.74s)]
*  We're actually doing a live show tonight in Austin. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7046.860000000001s)]
*  Well, it'll be last night by the time this comes out probably. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7049.860000000001s)]
*  But we put into the chat GPT, [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7052.5s)]
*  write a monologue in the voice of Sagar and Jetty [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7056.46s)]
*  about UFOs. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7058.78s)]
*  And it does a thing. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7060.42s)]
*  It serves, the grammar is good. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7062.9800000000005s)]
*  It doesn't sound like Sagar at all, [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7066.42s)]
*  like the sort of grammar they use [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7069.38s)]
*  and the way they approach it. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7070.9s)]
*  They'll be like, ladies and gentlemen, [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7071.74s)]
*  it's time we have an important conversation about UFOs. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7072.58s)]
*  I've seen you say that. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7075.259999999999s)]
*  I love it. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7076.099999999999s)]
*  If you wanted to be grandiose, [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7076.94s)]
*  it was very important for me. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7078.179999999999s)]
*  That'd be like 90s politicians, [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7079.0199999999995s)]
*  like ladies and gentlemen, it's time we're gonna have [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7080.98s)]
*  an important conversation. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7082.9s)]
*  Have you heard Lex Friedman talk about it though? [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7083.74s)]
*  Lex was on my podcast. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7084.98s)]
*  I hadn't gotten fully through your podcast [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7085.82s)]
*  with that. Oh, I'd be interested to hear [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7086.66s)]
*  what he has to say, yeah. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7088.54s)]
*  He said, chat 4.0 is on the way. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7089.38s)]
*  Oh, that's right, because it has more information [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7092.0199999999995s)]
*  that's gonna be available to it. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7093.58s)]
*  It's gonna be way, way, way better. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7094.42s)]
*  See, I listened to Sam Altman, [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7096.66s)]
*  who's the CEO of OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7098.5s)]
*  I heard he got a question about the fourth version [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7102.34s)]
*  because there is a lot of speculation [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7105.9800000000005s)]
*  that it's gonna be like a whole other universe [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7107.62s)]
*  in terms of his capabilities, [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7110.3s)]
*  that it's gonna be more closely approximating [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7111.58s)]
*  actual intelligence in a way [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7114.74s)]
*  that's gonna really super freak people out. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7116.22s)]
*  Like those are the, that's what a lot of people [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7117.74s)]
*  like Lex and others, I guess, are projecting. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7119.62s)]
*  He was really trying to pour cold water on that idea, [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7122.26s)]
*  but that may just be because he doesn't wanna get it [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7126.14s)]
*  over-hyped. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7128.9800000000005s)]
*  He wants to set the bar low [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7129.820000000001s)]
*  so that when the thing actually drops, [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7131.660000000001s)]
*  you know, it lands with appropriate, I guess, fanfare. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7133.54s)]
*  The real thing of concern is that [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7137.02s)]
*  this didn't exist four years ago, [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7140.06s)]
*  three years ago, two years ago, [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7141.900000000001s)]
*  and now it exists and it's gotten better really quickly. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7143.46s)]
*  Maybe it did exist two years ago, [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7145.9800000000005s)]
*  but it wasn't publicly consumable. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7147.26s)]
*  It didn't have a chat function. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7149.18s)]
*  That was a thing. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7150.820000000001s)]
*  That's the thing is actually, [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7151.66s)]
*  this was again, you know, [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7153.58s)]
*  listening to this interview with Sam Altman, [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7154.62s)]
*  he was talking about how he was actually really surprised [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7156.5s)]
*  by the way that the public, [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7160.5s)]
*  when they got to play with it, were like, oh my God. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7161.9s)]
*  Because in his mind, working so closely with the technology, [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7165.18s)]
*  this just felt like the next logical step. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7169.0599999999995s)]
*  But for people who hadn't been deeply, you know, [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7172.0599999999995s)]
*  enmeshed in the details of the technology, [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7175.38s)]
*  when suddenly you had this thing in front of you [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7177.86s)]
*  and you could play with it [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7179.54s)]
*  and then you've got this like the image generators [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7180.42s)]
*  and whatever, that it kind of blew people's minds. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7182.5s)]
*  And we've been talking about how [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7185.82s)]
*  you've got universities professors who are freaked out [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7187.66s)]
*  about kids cheating on tests [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7190.22s)]
*  and using this to write their essays and whatever. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7193.14s)]
*  And so I do think it's gonna require [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7195.9s)]
*  a kind of entire rethink of the university experience [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7198.02s)]
*  of which parts of, like, [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7202.22s)]
*  what parts of what human beings can do [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7204.86s)]
*  are more difficult to replicate by the machine. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7207.78s)]
*  Because the machine can spit out [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7210.46s)]
*  a Sager and Jetty theoretical UFO monologue, [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7211.66s)]
*  but it can't create new ideas, right? [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7214.099999999999s)]
*  It's lacking a sort of like creativity. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7217.0199999999995s)]
*  For now. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7219.26s)]
*  Yes, for now. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7220.099999999999s)]
*  For now. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7221.46s)]
*  That's the real thing is for now. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7222.7s)]
*  Because I think it's going to. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7224.94s)]
*  And I think within five years, it's gonna be better at us. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7226.62s)]
*  Oh. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7229.26s)]
*  Better at being us than us. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7230.099999999999s)]
*  But that's actually important [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7231.66s)]
*  and it's one of the fun things [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7232.94s)]
*  that we're seeing through the chat GPT education, [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7233.78s)]
*  which I love. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7236.0199999999995s)]
*  And actually it's fascinating. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7236.9s)]
*  We get a ton of feedback on those segments [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7237.94s)]
*  because it's a lot of college kids [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7240.139999999999s)]
*  are fed up with bullshit busy work. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7241.219999999999s)]
*  A lot of professors are tearing up their entire syllabus [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7243.299999999999s)]
*  and they're like, all right, [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7246.54s)]
*  now we're gonna go to oral examination. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7247.94s)]
*  We're gonna have a discussion in class. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7250.0199999999995s)]
*  And I was like, that's great. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7252.099999999999s)]
*  That's fantastic. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7253.339999999999s)]
*  You shouldn't be doing a bullshit essay first draft. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7254.179999999999s)]
*  But that also teaches you how to write, [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7257.179999999999s)]
*  which is actually important. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7259.62s)]
*  Actually, I don't know if it does actually. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7260.66s)]
*  It could. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7262.139999999999s)]
*  Well, but if you have, [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7262.98s)]
*  so the comparison they make [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7264.099999999999s)]
*  is to like the invention of the calculator. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7266.5s)]
*  It's like, you still need to understand the math [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7269.38s)]
*  to know what to put into the calculator, [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7272.22s)]
*  but you don't need to know how to do all that shit by hand. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7274.5s)]
*  Can we pause this? [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7276.860000000001s)]
*  I have to pee so bad. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7277.7s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7278.54s)]
*  Go ahead. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7279.38s)]
*  Let's use the restroom. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7280.2s)]
*  I need to pee too. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7281.04s)]
*  We're right back. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7281.88s)]
*  All right, we're back. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7282.7s)]
*  Think so much better. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7283.820000000001s)]
*  What will we? [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7284.860000000001s)]
*  Chat GPT. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7285.7s)]
*  Chat GPT colleges. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7286.54s)]
*  And I do think part of the freak out right now [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7288.34s)]
*  is because most automation that has killed people's jobs [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7293.7s)]
*  has been service workers, has been blue collar. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7298.42s)]
*  And now you have a lot of white collar workers [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7301.74s)]
*  who are like, oh shit, this could be coming for me. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7303.3s)]
*  Did you see the Buzzfeed thing? [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7306.1s)]
*  That Buzzfeed hired Chat GPT, [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7307.34s)]
*  or is gonna use Chat GPT to auto-generate listicles. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7308.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, they laid off. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7311.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, there we go. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7313.18s)]
*  They just laid 10% of their staff off. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7314.02s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7314.860000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7315.7s)]
*  Oh, and by the way. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7317.18s)]
*  Well, this is the big fear, right? [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7318.02s)]
*  And their stock, didn't their stock skyrocket? [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7318.84s)]
*  Yeah, their stock went up, I wanna say 95% [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7320.5s)]
*  in a single day. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7323.900000000001s)]
*  Fire people give you more money. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7324.740000000001s)]
*  Yay, hooray. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7325.580000000001s)]
*  What a great system we have. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7326.9800000000005s)]
*  Not great. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7328.1s)]
*  But doesn't that leave room for sub-stack people? [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7329.06s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7332.900000000001s)]
*  And doesn't it leave room for creators [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7333.740000000001s)]
*  that you get an obvious look into their mind [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7335.46s)]
*  and they take pride in their writing? [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7339.52s)]
*  I would say to young kids, [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7341.820000000001s)]
*  I would say fuck around with Chat GPT. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7343.580000000001s)]
*  I would say figure out what it does [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7345.84s)]
*  because it's an important thing. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7348.06s)]
*  But learn how to write. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7349.5s)]
*  I think it's good for you. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7352.14s)]
*  And I think if you wanna get better [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7353.54s)]
*  at whatever you're doing that requires writing, [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7355.0s)]
*  like if you're gonna be a journalist, [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7356.820000000001s)]
*  even if you use Chat GPT to give you a framework, [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7358.18s)]
*  you should learn how to be creative. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7361.06s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7362.54s)]
*  It's good for you. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7363.38s)]
*  I do think that's a good point [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7364.200000000001s)]
*  and it's where the calculator analogy kind of fails [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7365.740000000001s)]
*  because the calculations are the calculations. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7368.9400000000005s)]
*  There's no style or voice that goes into it. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7371.3s)]
*  Whereas, I mean, Sagar and I write a lot every single week. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7375.42s)]
*  I know you write a lot as part of being a comedian. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7379.46s)]
*  And when you do that a lot over time, [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7383.18s)]
*  you develop your own voice, you develop your own style [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7386.06s)]
*  that you maybe aren't going to come to [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7389.0s)]
*  if you're starting with the Chat GPT framework. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7392.02s)]
*  Even if you're not just wholesale, [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7394.42s)]
*  taking whatever Chat gives you [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7395.94s)]
*  and selling that off as your own, [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7397.64s)]
*  even if you're taking it and workshopping, whatever, [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7399.58s)]
*  it's not quite the same as staring at the blank piece [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7402.18s)]
*  of paper and creating it in your voice. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7405.22s)]
*  And the satisfaction that you get. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7408.36s)]
*  The satisfaction when you write something that you enjoy, [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7411.0s)]
*  that you're like, oh, I did a lot of work on this [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7413.44s)]
*  and I'm really proud of it. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7415.48s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7416.719999999999s)]
*  I mean, we write these monologues for the show [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7418.16s)]
*  and we do three a week, [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7420.4s)]
*  so some of them are going to be great, [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7422.5199999999995s)]
*  some of them are going to be solid, [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7423.92s)]
*  some are going to be like, oh, it was a bit of a struggle. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7426.04s)]
*  But when you get that one that it's like you have the idea [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7427.759999999999s)]
*  and you're able to lay it out in a way that you feel like [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7430.719999999999s)]
*  really captures what you were trying to say [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7433.66s)]
*  and makes a point that you feel like [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7435.84s)]
*  hasn't been made before, that's wonderful. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7437.72s)]
*  That's why I'm celebrating it with the classroom though, [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7440.08s)]
*  because I had to do, when I was in college, [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7442.08s)]
*  we had so many bullshit busy work quizzes [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7443.56s)]
*  that they were just doing to assign [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7446.6s)]
*  so they could check a box on the syllabus. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7448.400000000001s)]
*  Now, they're sitting in the classroom being like, [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7450.52s)]
*  what do you think? [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7452.68s)]
*  They have to test you live to see [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7453.52s)]
*  if you're either paying attention. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7454.88s)]
*  I think that's great. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7456.240000000001s)]
*  Ultimately, what did we really get out of college? [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7457.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7460.72s)]
*  In terms of what I use right now, [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7461.88s)]
*  even you were talking about writing, [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7463.400000000001s)]
*  a lot of that was bullshit academic writing. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7464.5s)]
*  When I learned how to write for journalism, [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7466.12s)]
*  it's totally different. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7467.96s)]
*  It's like all the opposite rules actually [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7468.9s)]
*  in terms of the way you do it. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7471.24s)]
*  But from what's useful in life [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7472.26s)]
*  is being able to understand ideas. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7474.92s)]
*  Part of what our show is consider [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7479.64s)]
*  an alternative point of view, [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7481.3s)]
*  the famous Plato quote, [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7482.36s)]
*  it's the mark of an intelligent mind to consider an opinion, [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7483.64s)]
*  something like, an opinion that he doesn't [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7486.4s)]
*  necessarily agree with. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7488.24s)]
*  It's, I'm butchering it. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7489.08s)]
*  But that is what you could possibly get [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7490.26s)]
*  out of higher education today. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7492.5199999999995s)]
*  Coming together, taking a four year pause on your life, [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7494.26s)]
*  talking with this professor, [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7497.280000000001s)]
*  there's a professor right now at UPenn, [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7498.34s)]
*  Wharton, who's actually requiring chat GPT in the classroom. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7500.02s)]
*  He's like, no, no, no, no, no, for entrepreneurship. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7503.06s)]
*  We're all gonna use it. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7504.900000000001s)]
*  We're gonna learn how to use this tool together [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7505.820000000001s)]
*  and then we're gonna talk about it in the classroom. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7508.02s)]
*  That's what education actually can be. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7510.46s)]
*  And so I talk a lot about higher education corruption [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7512.780000000001s)]
*  and really what it is to me is, [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7515.7s)]
*  places charge an $80,000 a year, [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7517.14s)]
*  which is outrageous putting these kids into debt [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7519.4800000000005s)]
*  and not teaching them anything, [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7521.900000000001s)]
*  which is actually useful in the real world. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7523.06s)]
*  And I think this is useful. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7526.1s)]
*  It's just like a, learning. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7527.42s)]
*  It's just like a stamp of approval. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7529.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's a credential. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7530.9400000000005s)]
*  You know, it's a credential. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7531.780000000001s)]
*  That's what it is. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7532.900000000001s)]
*  I mean, I will say, so I studied economics [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7533.72s)]
*  and we obviously talk a lot about economics, [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7535.780000000001s)]
*  but the shit that I learned was like, [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7538.900000000001s)]
*  you know, it was all very doctrinaire. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7541.3s)]
*  It was all very like. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7543.14s)]
*  Supply and demand. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7544.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it was like a lot of stuff [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7545.34s)]
*  I had to like unlearn the propaganda of, you know, [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7547.1s)]
*  ultimately. Oh, that's a great point too. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7550.38s)]
*  This is how the Federal Reserve works [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7551.34s)]
*  and then we're doing all these segments about the Fed. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7552.62s)]
*  I'm like, well, maybe it shouldn't. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7553.98s)]
*  And then it's like, oh, this is all a human design system. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7555.0599999999995s)]
*  So you'll read books. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7557.66s)]
*  It's like the something on Jekyll Island [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7558.74s)]
*  on the creation of the Fed [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7560.82s)]
*  and then what the Fed's actual mandate is. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7562.0199999999995s)]
*  And you're like, oh, the Fed has a lot of power [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7563.98s)]
*  over our society, over our economy, [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7565.54s)]
*  over our politics actually. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7568.3s)]
*  Like there's a lot of arguments [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7569.72s)]
*  about certain politicians never would have gone [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7570.66s)]
*  if the Fed hadn't been doing the policies that they had, [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7572.46s)]
*  like Jimmy Carter in 1979 with Paul Volcker. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7575.22s)]
*  We're living actually in an era right now [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7578.0199999999995s)]
*  of tremendous departure [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7579.7s)]
*  from previous Federal Reserve policy. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7581.1s)]
*  We went from a zero interest rate environment [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7583.14s)]
*  to higher interest rates. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7585.1s)]
*  The economy right now [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7586.18s)]
*  is the craziest thing you've ever seen. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7587.46s)]
*  So the jobs numbers actually came out this morning. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7588.660000000001s)]
*  We are at one of the lowest unemployment rates [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7590.820000000001s)]
*  in modern American history. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7593.02s)]
*  Since 1969. Right. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7593.860000000001s)]
*  So it's a great economy, right? [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7595.22s)]
*  But wage stagnation, [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7597.18s)]
*  it's not keeping up with inflation of goods. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7599.620000000001s)]
*  Try buying a house right now. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7602.120000000001s)]
*  Mortgage rates are a disaster. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7603.660000000001s)]
*  They're falling slightly. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7605.54s)]
*  We've been talking a lot about the used car industry. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7606.860000000001s)]
*  Car loans are a total nightmare. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7609.5s)]
*  You're seeing all these charlatans in the economy. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7611.6s)]
*  Like what is this? [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7614.06s)]
*  What has been created? [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7614.98s)]
*  The tech layoffs is a good example. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7615.98s)]
*  You have Google cutting 10%, [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7617.94s)]
*  Amazon cutting 10,000 jobs, [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7620.34s)]
*  Salesforce cutting 10,000 jobs. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7622.56s)]
*  All of this was just because of cheap money. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7624.54s)]
*  And so that makes you take a step back and be like, [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7626.94s)]
*  wow, like the Fed is a non-democratic institution. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7629.42s)]
*  You and I have no input on the Fed whatsoever. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7632.1s)]
*  The president appoints the chair [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7634.86s)]
*  and the rest of those people get confirmed by Congress. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7636.3s)]
*  And then after that, it's up to them. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7638.6s)]
*  They could nuke the entire US economy if they wanted to. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7640.34s)]
*  It's literally up to like 14 people. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7642.9800000000005s)]
*  And you're like, holy shit. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7644.92s)]
*  So much of my life is determined by these folks. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7646.76s)]
*  And I don't think people realize that. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7649.200000000001s)]
*  And it's intentional that they make it very opaque [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7650.72s)]
*  and make people feel dumb. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7653.96s)]
*  Like they don't understand it. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7655.68s)]
*  It's intentional? [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7656.68s)]
*  Very intentional. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7657.72s)]
*  This is actually Alan Greenspan sort of innovated this [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7658.56s)]
*  of like Fed speak, [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7661.160000000001s)]
*  where any pronouncement he made was like incomprehensible [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7662.860000000001s)]
*  if you didn't have a PhD in economics. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7667.16s)]
*  And it hasn't always been like that in American history. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7669.44s)]
*  Fed policy, monetary policy was hotly debated. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7672.5199999999995s)]
*  There were like populist revolts over it. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7675.68s)]
*  William Jennings Bryan. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7677.5599999999995s)]
*  There's a real anti-populist movement to consolidate power [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7678.4s)]
*  in the hands of a few like credentialed bureaucrats [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7683.44s)]
*  by posturing like, oh, we're just sort of like [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7686.32s)]
*  doing the math and it's just a calculation [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7688.72s)]
*  and there's no morals involved. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7690.8s)]
*  We don't need to understand [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7692.08s)]
*  what other people think about it. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7693.5199999999995s)]
*  And to make it feel like, oh, we've got this [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7694.72s)]
*  because we're the credentialed experts when, [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7696.72s)]
*  in reality, these are things that affect people's lives. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7698.96s)]
*  But on the fakery in the economy, [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7701.84s)]
*  I think this is one of the undertold stories of our era [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7705.0s)]
*  is the, we're talking a lot about incentives earlier. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7710.6s)]
*  The incentives for corporate America are not to innovate, [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7713.4400000000005s)]
*  not to create new products, [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7717.6s)]
*  certainly not to invest in their workforce. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7719.26s)]
*  It's all to engage in financial engineering [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7721.96s)]
*  to reward themselves and their stockholders. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7725.4s)]
*  So stock buybacks, this year I just saw a stat, [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7728.4s)]
*  largest first quarter or first month of the year [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7731.599999999999s)]
*  stock buybacks that we've ever had. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7734.679999999999s)]
*  You look at companies like airline companies [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7737.839999999999s)]
*  where you think, oh, they're making their money [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7739.98s)]
*  by like flying people around and whatever. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7741.2s)]
*  No, actually they're giant hedge funds [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7742.96s)]
*  and most of their money comes from financial manipulation [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7745.28s)]
*  and like it started with hedging, [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7749.639999999999s)]
*  let me hedge the cost of jet fuel, [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7750.96s)]
*  but then that turns into big business. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7753.12s)]
*  And so they basically become Wall Street. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7754.48s)]
*  Apple, this is one of, Rana Faroohar, [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7756.36s)]
*  who's a very great, very smart financial thinker. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7758.719999999999s)]
*  She wrote a book that highlighted this statistic. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7761.28s)]
*  Apple, when they released the iPod, [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7764.24s)]
*  their stock that year actually went down. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7767.12s)]
*  When they did financial manipulation [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7769.62s)]
*  and like gigantic stock buybacks, their stock goes up. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7771.66s)]
*  So it just shows you how much of our whole economy [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7775.04s)]
*  big picture is basically fake, [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7778.759999999999s)]
*  geared towards financial engineering [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7781.839999999999s)]
*  and not towards actual innovation, development, [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7783.88s)]
*  like growing a company based on a good idea [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7787.56s)]
*  and a good product. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7789.92s)]
*  Well, you talk about this with your phone all the time, [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7791.88s)]
*  right? [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7793.4400000000005s)]
*  You're like my iPhone, what was like iPhone 4 [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7794.28s)]
*  is not all that different from iPhone 14. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7795.8s)]
*  That's an exaggeration, but like iPhone 11 [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7797.8s)]
*  and iPhone 14 aren't that different. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7799.56s)]
*  Apple has actually increased its revenue significantly [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7801.14s)]
*  by through its bundle of services, [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7804.2s)]
*  by increasing the amount of costs [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7805.92s)]
*  that it can pull from the app store, [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7808.08s)]
*  by I've got my Mac here so everything is locked in here, [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7809.84s)]
*  software as a service, [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7812.84s)]
*  everything is linked into the Apple bundle. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7814.16s)]
*  That Tim Cook's great, there's a great book, [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7816.76s)]
*  I forget exactly the name, I think it's Apple, [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7819.04s)]
*  Life After Steve, so after Steve Jobs died. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7820.8s)]
*  Steve was a product guy. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7823.32s)]
*  He would invest hundreds of billions of dollars into R&D, [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7824.64s)]
*  into creating game changing, beautiful new products. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7827.96s)]
*  Tim Cook is a managerial type. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7831.0s)]
*  His job is to squeeze as much money out of the stock price. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7832.4800000000005s)]
*  So how do you do that? [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7835.08s)]
*  A, you park a hundred billion dollars or whatever overseas [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7835.900000000001s)]
*  so you don't have to pay taxes on it. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7838.6s)]
*  B, you don't invest necessarily in brand new R&D, [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7840.42s)]
*  you invest in making sure [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7844.0s)]
*  that people get the new phone every year. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7845.22s)]
*  You invest in paying 2.99 for that iCloud bubble. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7847.14s)]
*  I mean, imagine what that is at scale. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7850.66s)]
*  And at scale, what they're doing is locking people [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7852.74s)]
*  into services with Apple, [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7855.1s)]
*  which are recurring subscription revenue. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7856.9400000000005s)]
*  It's a shitload of money and it juice, [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7858.54s)]
*  I think their stock is like at the highest level ever, [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7860.14s)]
*  but when's the last time you have, okay, you have a Tesla. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7862.4800000000005s)]
*  Like when you got into a Tesla, [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7866.3s)]
*  it's like picking up the iPhone 4 for the first time [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7867.54s)]
*  and you're like, holy fuck, [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7869.66s)]
*  I can't even believe this is real. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7870.82s)]
*  Like this is a new thing. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7872.0199999999995s)]
*  The first time I had an iPhone 4 [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7873.5s)]
*  and it had that beautiful back [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7874.98s)]
*  and it was like Steve Jobs described it [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7876.78s)]
*  as looking like a Leica camera or something. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7879.0199999999995s)]
*  I remember holding it and just being like, [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7881.18s)]
*  this is the coolest fucking thing I've ever seen. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7882.38s)]
*  I felt the same way whenever I got into a Tesla. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7884.34s)]
*  I'm like, I'm not in a car, I'm in a computer. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7886.54s)]
*  I'm in a computer that drives. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7887.9s)]
*  And that leap, like think about how rare that is [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7889.26s)]
*  over the last 20 years. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7892.7s)]
*  You had Marc Andreessen on [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7894.28s)]
*  and Peter Thiel also has a famous quote on this. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7895.34s)]
*  He's like, we were promised flying cars [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7897.74s)]
*  and all we got was 140 characters, [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7899.14s)]
*  except now we have 280 characters. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7900.9800000000005s)]
*  It's like, yeah, I mean, we had some tech advancements, [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7902.700000000001s)]
*  but at the end of the day, [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7906.34s)]
*  I've been using the same relative phone [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7907.54s)]
*  for the last 10 years. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7909.4800000000005s)]
*  And if you were to ask me in 2012 [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7910.660000000001s)]
*  when the first time I picked up that iPhone 4, [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7912.660000000001s)]
*  I would be like, no way, man, 10 years from now, [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7914.62s)]
*  who's gonna know? [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7916.38s)]
*  We're gonna have Oculus, [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7917.22s)]
*  we're gonna be living in this brave new world, [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7918.04s)]
*  for example, and we're not really there. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7920.68s)]
*  Chat GPT is the first time I felt excited about something [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7922.38s)]
*  where I'm like, that's new, that's something. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7924.860000000001s)]
*  Now is it good? [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7927.1s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7927.9400000000005s)]
*  Any sort of tech progress. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7929.42s)]
*  There's good, there's bad. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7931.46s)]
*  There's trade off. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7933.099999999999s)]
*  There's trade off. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7933.94s)]
*  And you hope the good is more than the bad, [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7935.0199999999995s)]
*  it usually is. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7937.179999999999s)]
*  What's fascinating is there's a never ending push [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7938.0199999999995s)]
*  towards technological innovation [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7941.3s)]
*  that we don't ever see stopping. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7943.34s)]
*  We are 100% addicted to having the newest, best, [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7945.74s)]
*  greatest, latest, and then companies will continue [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7949.38s)]
*  to do that. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7952.46s)]
*  They're gonna be manipulating stock prices. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7953.42s)]
*  But at the core of it, [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7955.94s)]
*  if you want people to buy shit, [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7957.7s)]
*  you have to make better shit. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7958.9s)]
*  And so you're gonna have people that are- [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7960.42s)]
*  I wish that was the core of it though now, right? [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7962.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, at least at the end of the line of what gets done. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7963.7s)]
*  So if you looked at the earth from above, [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7967.82s)]
*  I use this analogy all the time, [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7969.98s)]
*  if you didn't know us, [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7971.38s)]
*  if you were from some other culture, [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7972.42s)]
*  some other planet, [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7973.98s)]
*  and you were trying to observe what human beings do, [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7975.0599999999995s)]
*  well, they make stuff. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7977.74s)]
*  They keep making better stuff. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7978.9s)]
*  There's a bunch of other stuff that goes on. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7980.46s)]
*  There's a bunch of, [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7982.179999999999s)]
*  there's keeping up with the Joneses, materialism, [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7984.179999999999s)]
*  but what that does ultimately [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7986.599999999999s)]
*  is it forces you to buy more stuff. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7987.96s)]
*  Like we are, [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7989.719999999999s)]
*  that the materialism instinct that people have, [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7990.5599999999995s)]
*  you know, it's a base thing. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7993.32s)]
*  It's like silly, why do it? [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7995.2s)]
*  It's a part of human beings for some strange reason, [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=7997.28s)]
*  the status thing. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8000.24s)]
*  And that status thing allows people [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8001.08s)]
*  to continue to innovate and buy new stuff [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8003.36s)]
*  and continue to make better and better versions of that thing [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8006.24s)]
*  so you're compelled to buy it. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8009.36s)]
*  And that's ultimately leading towards something. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8010.5599999999995s)]
*  So much of public companies in particular, [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8013.44s)]
*  this is where the incentives are the most fucked up. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8016.719999999999s)]
*  The amount that they spend on research and development now [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8019.36s)]
*  is way less than it used to be number one [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8022.5599999999995s)]
*  and dramatically less than private companies. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8024.5599999999995s)]
*  Because again, [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8027.48s)]
*  I was telling you the other day about this, [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8028.759999999999s)]
*  what might be the greatest corporate con in history [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8030.719999999999s)]
*  from this Indian industrialist [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8034.879999999999s)]
*  who was at least up until like the last week, [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8037.679999999999s)]
*  the richest man in Asia, [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8041.16s)]
*  fourth richest man on the planet [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8043.56s)]
*  after like, you know, Elon and Bezos and Bill Gates. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8045.2s)]
*  And there's no doubt his company is big. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8049.400000000001s)]
*  He's got close ties in with the Modi government. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8051.88s)]
*  He's built ports. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8054.84s)]
*  He's like involved in energy, runs airports, all this stuff. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8055.92s)]
*  But there was a big 100 page report [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8060.0s)]
*  that came out from this group called Hindenburg Research, [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8062.84s)]
*  which is known for sort of like identifying fraudsters. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8065.08s)]
*  They're short sellers, so let me be clear. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8067.08s)]
*  Like they have a financial incentive [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8068.360000000001s)]
*  also on the other side. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8069.8s)]
*  They're betting on this company going down. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8070.64s)]
*  But what they revealed was essentially that this guy, [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8073.76s)]
*  allegedly they deny it, [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8076.4800000000005s)]
*  had set up all of these shell companies [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8077.72s)]
*  that they were using to manipulate their stock, [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8080.96s)]
*  which propped up the company's value, [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8084.4800000000005s)]
*  which also hid how bad their like debt situation was, [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8086.400000000001s)]
*  that his brother was controlling [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8090.24s)]
*  a bunch of these shell companies. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8091.52s)]
*  And so over the course of the past, what, week and a half, [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8092.92s)]
*  his suite of companies, like seven different companies, [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8097.08s)]
*  have lost like half their value. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8099.76s)]
*  100 billion dollars. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8103.32s)]
*  He's lost half of his fortune in a week, 10 days, [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8104.879999999999s)]
*  something like that. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8110.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, the scheme is actually not all that dissimilar [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8111.36s)]
*  from the SBF thing, which is basically Mauritius, [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8113.44s)]
*  which is offshore. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8116.5199999999995s)]
*  They were using Mauritius-based shell companies [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8117.799999999999s)]
*  to have cash there that they actually owned [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8120.719999999999s)]
*  to buy their own stock, inflating the stock price. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8123.599999999999s)]
*  Based on inflation of stock, [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8127.2s)]
*  they're able to borrow actual cash against that stock. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8128.64s)]
*  So the actual value of the stock [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8132.68s)]
*  wasn't as high as it supposedly was. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8134.200000000001s)]
*  SBF kind of did the same thing [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8136.120000000001s)]
*  by issuing that own token, [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8137.68s)]
*  which they then claimed had value, [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8139.4800000000005s)]
*  and then borrowing actual cash [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8141.0s)]
*  based on the value of this false token. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8142.92s)]
*  And that's how you get the billions and billions [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8145.120000000001s)]
*  that stack up on each other. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8147.76s)]
*  And this would all be funny if Adnani [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8149.08s)]
*  was not one of the most powerful men in India, [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8151.4800000000005s)]
*  if his companies did not prop up [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8153.84s)]
*  and was invested by the, [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8156.44s)]
*  I think it's the State Bank of India. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8158.639999999999s)]
*  There is a tremendous amount of exposure [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8160.639999999999s)]
*  in the Indian economy to the, [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8162.96s)]
*  Adnani is a hero there, [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8165.0s)]
*  alongside Ambani and a few of the other industrialists. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8166.2s)]
*  There's a good book, if anyone's interested, [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8169.28s)]
*  called The Billionaire Raj, [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8170.36s)]
*  which is specifically about the rise [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8171.4s)]
*  of these new Indian oligarchs. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8173.599999999999s)]
*  And the amount of power that they yield in India [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8175.44s)]
*  is tremendous. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8178.679999999999s)]
*  So this is not a joke. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8179.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, this really would be like if Bezos was going down. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8180.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's that level. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8182.5199999999995s)]
*  But if anything, it's not even comparable, [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8184.719999999999s)]
*  because we have a lot of Bezoses. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8186.64s)]
*  They really only have like 12, like 15 [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8188.08s)]
*  of these house guys. And this guy was number one. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8190.48s)]
*  Yeah, he was the biggest. Wealthiest man, [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8192.08s)]
*  not just in India, but in all of Asia. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8193.52s)]
*  And like that, half his wealth gone. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8195.76s)]
*  They were doing a stock sale, [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8199.68s)]
*  2.5 billion dollars, [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8203.36s)]
*  raise more cash for the company, whatever. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8204.84s)]
*  And he had to actually back out of it [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8207.16s)]
*  because of all of this. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8210.16s)]
*  There's a video of him talking about it. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8212.08s)]
*  All of this fall out. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8212.92s)]
*  He's like, we are well capitalized, [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8213.76s)]
*  we have great assets, good balance sheet. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8215.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8217.84s)]
*  And his response. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8218.68s)]
*  Now listen, I want to be clear. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8224.28s)]
*  The response was 435 pages. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8226.0s)]
*  I do not claim that I read all of it, [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8228.36s)]
*  but in part what it said was like, [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8230.0s)]
*  was basically like, this is an attack on India [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8232.84s)]
*  rather than responding to the specific claims. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8235.32s)]
*  He's playing to sort of like Indian nationalism [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8238.4s)]
*  to try to rally. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8240.480000000001s)]
*  It's smart. It's smart thing to do. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8241.32s)]
*  If you criticize Anthony Fauci, [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8242.28s)]
*  criticizing science. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8244.28s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8245.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8245.960000000001s)]
*  That way we pulled the Fauci move. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8246.800000000001s)]
*  That's what he did. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8247.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8248.480000000001s)]
*  And I think it's working for him quite as well though. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8249.320000000002s)]
*  Wow. That's crazy. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8251.560000000001s)]
*  Right? [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8253.160000000002s)]
*  Wow. What a house of cards. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8254.0s)]
*  How many businesses are like that? [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8255.640000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8257.68s)]
*  Who knows? [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8258.52s)]
*  Good question. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8259.36s)]
*  That thing about SPF was, [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8260.2s)]
*  if CZ never does that tweet, [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8261.04s)]
*  what happens, man? [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8263.92s)]
*  Right. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8264.76s)]
*  He could be on the Forbes, [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8265.6s)]
*  he could be not even on the Forbes 400, [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8266.44s)]
*  on the Forbes 100. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8267.800000000001s)]
*  Like SPF, if this whole thing had been going, [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8268.640000000001s)]
*  it's kind of like Madoff. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8271.160000000002s)]
*  Madoff only fell apart. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8272.0s)]
*  I went deep on Madoff after SPF [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8272.96s)]
*  and it was only 2008 that brought him down. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8275.199999999999s)]
*  Like if the recession doesn't happen, [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8277.64s)]
*  Madoff sails off into the sun. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8279.599999999999s)]
*  Like he's fine. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8281.439999999999s)]
*  I think SPF, [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8282.439999999999s)]
*  I think whether it was then or sometime in the future, [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8284.759999999998s)]
*  I think his ticket was gonna get punched. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8288.519999999999s)]
*  Well, he's on amphetamines [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8290.279999999999s)]
*  and banging nine other willows [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8292.0s)]
*  in a penthouse in the Bahamas. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8294.0s)]
*  I mean, those people are off the fucking rails. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8296.359999999999s)]
*  They were nuts. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8299.0s)]
*  True. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8299.96s)]
*  Which I would be rooting for them [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8300.8s)]
*  if they weren't doing a swindle. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8302.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8303.199999999999s)]
*  If they were really super geniuses [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8304.039999999999s)]
*  that were like pulling off some amazing financial move. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8305.88s)]
*  I'd be like, fuck yeah. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8308.759999999998s)]
*  Go do it, go do it. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8309.599999999999s)]
*  Go nerds. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8310.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8311.279999999999s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8312.119999999999s)]
*  But no, I think because, [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8312.96s)]
*  I mean, so much of crypto is collapsing now. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8314.0s)]
*  And I mean, that's why it looks like, [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8317.679999999998s)]
*  oh, he denies wrongdoing, et cetera. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8320.4s)]
*  That's why it looks like they got so overextended [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8322.64s)]
*  at Alameda, which was basically like the crypto hedge fund [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8324.8s)]
*  because they placed all these bets. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8327.279999999999s)]
*  The bets were going south. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8329.4s)]
*  They needed more cash. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8330.68s)]
*  And so they're tapping into their customer accounts over at [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8332.0s)]
*  FTX. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8334.92s)]
*  It's all a story of leverage. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8335.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8336.599999999999s)]
*  I just feel like with so many of these crypto bubbles [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8337.439999999999s)]
*  and schemes and whatever, [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8341.64s)]
*  it's like they're just rediscovering all of the worst ills [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8342.599999999999s)]
*  of the banking system. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8346.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8347.32s)]
*  You know, it's like, oh, we did this new thing. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8348.16s)]
*  We discovered a bank run. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8349.279999999999s)]
*  Like, wow, this is what happens when people like freak out [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8352.039999999999s)]
*  and come and get their cash. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8354.92s)]
*  We talked about it in the green room [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8355.76s)]
*  that they need regulation. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8356.599999999999s)]
*  Well, they need... [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8357.96s)]
*  Do you have to have some sort of... [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8360.560000000001s)]
*  They need enforcement. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8361.84s)]
*  It is a little complicated because, I mean, look, [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8363.400000000001s)]
*  ultimately, you know, FTX was unwound. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8365.76s)]
*  The existing laws do not let you commit fraud. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8368.560000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8372.76s)]
*  So there needs to be enforcement. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8373.6s)]
*  Now, one of the things that we are keeping an eye on [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8375.6s)]
*  is at some point in the FTX run-up [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8380.6s)]
*  when he's buying all these politicians [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8382.92s)]
*  and he's buying all his like puff piece coverage [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8384.68s)]
*  in the New York Times and everywhere else, [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8386.92s)]
*  there is actually some effort to investigate him [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8389.96s)]
*  coming from the SEC. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8393.08s)]
*  And there was a bipartisan group of lawmakers [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8394.72s)]
*  that sent a letter that was like, hey, he's our boy. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8397.359999999999s)]
*  Like, don't... [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8399.519999999999s)]
*  They're like, don't touch the crypto industry. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8400.359999999999s)]
*  What are you doing? [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8402.359999999999s)]
*  But specifically about him. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8403.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, specifically about this guy. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8405.119999999999s)]
*  And so did that lead to the regulators saying like, [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8407.199999999999s)]
*  eh, I guess we're gonna like take a light touch. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8409.96s)]
*  We're not gonna dig into this. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8411.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8413.039999999999s)]
*  That's a question that I have about how all this works. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8413.88s)]
*  But I think that's part of why him in particular, [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8415.800000000001s)]
*  he cultivated this image on Capitol Hill. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8420.0s)]
*  He cultivated this image with the media [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8422.24s)]
*  and was able to hold up this scheme for as long as he did. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8424.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's a tough one. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8428.52s)]
*  Like you were talking, I don't know. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8429.44s)]
*  On the one hand, I'm a lot more, [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8430.56s)]
*  I guess I'm more sympathetic to the original idea of Bitcoin. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8432.16s)]
*  Like when we think, and to be fair, [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8435.12s)]
*  Bitcoin is very different than a lot of these other shit coins [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8437.04s)]
*  that are out there in terms of the invention [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8440.0s)]
*  by the invention of this mysterious man. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8441.64s)]
*  And then it has a limited number of supply. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8446.199999999999s)]
*  The original selling point of it as a hedge against inflation. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8448.76s)]
*  And also where I thought it was the most important [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8451.48s)]
*  was the idea of being able to get around sanctions, [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8453.84s)]
*  regulation, people being able to censor you. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8456.84s)]
*  Where a lot of that came apart though, [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8459.519999999999s)]
*  and this was scary was, if you remember, [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8461.16s)]
*  right before Ukraine, [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8462.68s)]
*  what was one of the biggest stories in the country? [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8463.519999999999s)]
*  Canada and the Canadian freedom protesters [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8464.88s)]
*  and how the Canadian government was seizing their banks. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8468.16s)]
*  And then what was even crazier [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8471.88s)]
*  is they were actually seizing their Bitcoin. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8472.96s)]
*  So it actually showed us one of the big choke points [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8475.119999999999s)]
*  in crypto. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8477.76s)]
*  I have some friends who work in the industry [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8478.6s)]
*  and I haven't really gotten a good answer on this, [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8480.32s)]
*  which is, to be able to seize Bitcoin, [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8482.44s)]
*  it's because a lot of it was sent on the platforms, [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8484.52s)]
*  which are itself regulated. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8486.6s)]
*  So for example, Coinbase is still subject [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8487.68s)]
*  in the United States to US regulation, [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8489.4s)]
*  in Canada similarly. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8491.6s)]
*  So the idea of the censorship free money, [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8493.4s)]
*  it's possible if you know how to do it. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8495.88s)]
*  I barely know how to do it. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8498.84s)]
*  I'm not, yeah. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8499.68s)]
*  Wait a minute, so the government of Canada [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8500.52s)]
*  went into Coinbase and extracted Bitcoin? [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8502.6s)]
*  I'm not gonna say it was Coinbase necessarily, [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8505.6s)]
*  but they were, Jamie, I'm sure you can find this. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8507.28s)]
*  It was Canadian government seizes cryptocurrency [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8509.32s)]
*  sent by US citizens to the actual Canadian freedom [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8511.4s)]
*  protesters. Oh, okay. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8514.88s)]
*  And that was one of the problems was that, [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8515.88s)]
*  because some of that was on the exchanges, [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8517.36s)]
*  which are subject to regulation, [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8519.16s)]
*  it's the same thing as if I were trying to wire them money [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8520.6s)]
*  to a prohibited group in Canada. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8523.48s)]
*  But you were looking at that and you're like, man, [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8525.76s)]
*  that level of censorship resistance, [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8528.0s)]
*  which I still really believe in, [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8530.12s)]
*  like we gotta have something in terms of, [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8531.36s)]
*  there's a current lot of pressure right now [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8533.4s)]
*  for the Fed and for the United States [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8534.960000000001s)]
*  to create like a centralized digital currency. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8536.48s)]
*  And even, I mean, essentially cashless, [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8538.800000000001s)]
*  we basically live in a quasi cashless society right now. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8540.800000000001s)]
*  If you think about China, [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8544.76s)]
*  one of the ways that they're able to implement [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8545.76s)]
*  their social credit score system is everything [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8547.6s)]
*  is within the WeChat app over there and Alipay. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8549.880000000001s)]
*  It's all integrated, [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8553.2s)]
*  not only for your social credit core system, [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8554.16s)]
*  your Uber, all of that is there and you tap to pay. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8556.24s)]
*  Well, that's great for convenience. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8559.199999999999s)]
*  It's also, oh, if you piss off the government, [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8561.16s)]
*  like you can't pay for anything anymore. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8563.119999999999s)]
*  You can't get a bus ticket. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8564.72s)]
*  You can't get all that. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8566.08s)]
*  So I don't know what the... [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8567.52s)]
*  The problem is when you have the wild, wild west, [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8569.44s)]
*  the people are gonna rise to the top. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8573.32s)]
*  It's not an accident that you end up [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8575.4s)]
*  with like psychopathic charlatans, [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8577.68s)]
*  like SBF at the top of this thing, [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8579.8s)]
*  because it is like the time, in a way, [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8581.96s)]
*  the time before you had like a central bank [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8584.92s)]
*  and when you had all these different currencies [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8587.16s)]
*  competing with each other in the US. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8589.199999999999s)]
*  And so I too was sympathetic to the original idea [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8591.16s)]
*  behind crypto, which is like, you know, look, [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8596.96s)]
*  fiat money is also just based on what we all decide [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8600.56s)]
*  to put value on now. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8604.0s)]
*  I would say like our fiat currency is also backed [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8604.839999999998s)]
*  by the United States government and the military, et cetera, [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8606.92s)]
*  et cetera, and being the most powerful country on the planet. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8608.88s)]
*  So there is more than just like a belief in it at this point, [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8610.56s)]
*  but okay. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8613.439999999999s)]
*  And so if we have this like mode of exchange [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8614.52s)]
*  and this sort of like anarchist principles of organization, [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8616.56s)]
*  it was really a response, a philosophical response, [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8620.64s)]
*  the failures of 2008. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8624.68s)]
*  When you see how bankrupt are and corrupt [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8626.4s)]
*  our existing financial institutions are and how rigged [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8629.279999999999s)]
*  and how much they lie and how captured [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8632.4s)]
*  the political system is. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8634.76s)]
*  And so I understand the impetus for it, [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8636.48s)]
*  but in reality, it has never been used as like actual [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8639.84s)]
*  currency to a significant degree. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8644.8s)]
*  It just became a like purely speculative vehicle. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8647.0s)]
*  And to your point, like the idea that the three of us [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8651.52s)]
*  could just go out and be like, we're making Rogan coin. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8655.32s)]
*  And like, we bought- [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8658.04s)]
*  We can make a shitload of money on that by the way. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8659.44s)]
*  We like hired Kim Kardashian to sell you Rogan coin. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8660.28s)]
*  And if we can like pump it up and do the confidence game [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8663.44s)]
*  enough, then we can run away with real cash [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8665.960000000001s)]
*  and leave all these people holding the bag. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8668.640000000001s)]
*  When I look at that, I'm like, I think this went astray. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8671.32s)]
*  Yeah, it went astray 100%. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8674.52s)]
*  No doubt. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8675.92s)]
*  I think this went wildly astray. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8676.76s)]
*  But isn't that inevitable? [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8677.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think it was. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8678.76s)]
*  That's what they would say. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8679.6s)]
*  With some new emerging thing, [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8680.44s)]
*  you're gonna have some crazy people that rise to the top. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8681.48s)]
*  It's like what Crystal was saying [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8683.56s)]
*  with the original US currency, [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8684.52s)]
*  we didn't have centralized greenbacks in the United States [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8686.08s)]
*  till the civil war. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8688.28s)]
*  And that was because the government literally [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8689.2s)]
*  wanted to be able to print money and buy weapons [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8691.48s)]
*  and goods with it without having to pay gold. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8694.0s)]
*  Before that, we had state issued and bank notes, [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8696.080000000002s)]
*  which was like a total free for all in the US. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8699.04s)]
*  It was actually kind of wild. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8701.880000000001s)]
*  And it literally took the civil war [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8702.84s)]
*  to be able to push back against that. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8703.960000000001s)]
*  And guess what? [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8705.720000000001s)]
*  There was a ton of charlatans, there were silver runs, [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8706.560000000001s)]
*  there were bank runs, there was like multiple panics [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8708.640000000001s)]
*  of like 1816 or whatever. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8711.36s)]
*  Or even leading up to the Great Depression [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8713.76s)]
*  and the stock market crash of 1929, [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8717.160000000002s)]
*  there was a whole buildup in the 20s [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8719.560000000001s)]
*  of people were introduced to the idea [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8722.6s)]
*  of buying stock on margin. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8725.4s)]
*  And they didn't really understand what it meant. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8727.08s)]
*  And there were all these local dealers [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8729.36s)]
*  who were getting them in on it. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8730.76s)]
*  And there was just tons of fraud, charlatans, [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8731.84s)]
*  people lying, all this stuff. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8736.12s)]
*  And so after 1929, there were a lot of banking reforms [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8738.28s)]
*  that basically made banking boring. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8741.880000000001s)]
*  They separated all the gambling and wild speculation out [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8744.0s)]
*  from the just like basic customer deposit, [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8747.44s)]
*  like regular bank that people go to. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8750.640000000001s)]
*  And then over the years, that was eaten away [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8752.800000000001s)]
*  and those regulations were eaten away. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8756.2s)]
*  And eventually you ended up sort of back [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8757.800000000001s)]
*  to a pre-1929 situation where they were again allowed [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8759.32s)]
*  to speculate in these wild ways and there was no separation. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8763.76s)]
*  And so after the crash, the housing crash in 2008, [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8766.92s)]
*  there was effort to reform the banking sector. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8771.68s)]
*  There were some things that were done [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8775.08s)]
*  through the Dodd-Frank financial reform, [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8776.92s)]
*  but they never went back to just separating out [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8778.880000000001s)]
*  those two pieces and making it boring again, [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8782.24s)]
*  the way that it was boring and stable the way that it was. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8784.52s)]
*  And so to me, I understand the response of crypto [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8787.52s)]
*  and looking at this and being like, this system is fucked. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8791.72s)]
*  We need to just like do our own thing. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8794.28s)]
*  Like this, it's corrupt, it's disgusting. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8796.68s)]
*  I totally get that. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8798.8s)]
*  But I think the only answer to it [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8800.44s)]
*  is to have better reforms of the existing system [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8802.2s)]
*  to make it safe and less corrupt [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8805.88s)]
*  and not have this wild speculation [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8809.039999999999s)]
*  that can create these bubbles that just like, [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8811.439999999999s)]
*  destroy the entire economy and people's livelihoods. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8813.42s)]
*  Is that feasible? [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8816.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's great. Yeah. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8817.759999999998s)]
*  Well, that's what they would say. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8818.599999999999s)]
*  They're like, look, the system is corrupt. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8819.42s)]
*  If 2008 happens and we have Dodd-Frank [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8821.359999999999s)]
*  and the system doesn't get fixed, [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8824.48s)]
*  what are we supposed to do? [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8826.24s)]
*  I actually get that. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8827.599999999999s)]
*  I don't know, I'm really of two minds of it. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8829.08s)]
*  On the one hand, I deeply sympathize with the individualism [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8830.48s)]
*  of like, look, we're gonna take it into our own hands, boys. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8833.6s)]
*  Nobody's coming to save us. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8835.96s)]
*  Like, this is all we got. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8837.34s)]
*  There are a lot of preppers actually who bought Bitcoin [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8838.96s)]
*  or sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8840.8s)]
*  because they bought in very early. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8842.359999999999s)]
*  So shout out to those guys. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8843.72s)]
*  On the other, look, at the end of the day, [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8845.58s)]
*  systems can change if enough people [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8847.119999999999s)]
*  actually want to do something about it. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8848.9s)]
*  We've talked a lot about the stock market ban. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8850.96s)]
*  I think that's actually probably step one. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8852.72s)]
*  If we get to the point where we can just ban members [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8854.74s)]
*  of Congress from trading stocks, [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8857.76s)]
*  the institutional trust, I think that we could all then, [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8859.92s)]
*  have within the system, just at a baseline level, [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8862.56s)]
*  it would help a lot. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8865.24s)]
*  It would help a lot to be able to get that. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8866.439999999999s)]
*  But of course, Nancy Pelosi is the speaker. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8868.08s)]
*  First she says, what was it? [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8871.199999999999s)]
*  Wait, so we live in a free market economy, [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8872.16s)]
*  we're allowed to participate. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8873.779999999999s)]
*  She walks that back. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8875.4s)]
*  I think we should be able to participate. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8876.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8877.24s)]
*  When she said that, like, pushed the microphone. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8878.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8879.72s)]
*  I just walked off the stage. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8880.56s)]
*  Your Nancy Pelosi impression is pretty good. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8882.76s)]
*  That was wild. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8885.0s)]
*  When she just walked off the stage, I'm like, that is wild. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8885.96s)]
*  I mean, she's not the only one though. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8888.88s)]
*  It's a completely bipartisan issue. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8890.98s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8892.66s)]
*  And a lot of these guys, and they'll claim, [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8893.5s)]
*  they're like, look, I don't have any inside information. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8895.82s)]
*  I'm like, look motherfucker, you're guilty. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8897.58s)]
*  You gotta prove that you're innocent. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8899.699999999999s)]
*  Honestly, I mean, whether, listen, they do. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8901.5s)]
*  And obviously, these are not geniuses, [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8904.14s)]
*  and they're all beating the market [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8906.9s)]
*  and beating people who are expert at this and whatever. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8908.82s)]
*  George Soros and Warren Buffett [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8911.18s)]
*  are not as good as Paul Pelosi. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8912.76s)]
*  Oh wow. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8914.539999999999s)]
*  He's better. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8915.38s)]
*  He's better at trading. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8916.26s)]
*  He's just an amazing trader. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8917.34s)]
*  Google trade just the other day, [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8918.34s)]
*  right before the anti-trust suit was filed, [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8920.26s)]
*  it sold like $3 million. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8922.1s)]
*  And once again, you're just never gonna convince me [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8923.220000000001s)]
*  that you didn't know about that. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8924.94s)]
*  Like, you're just not going to. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8925.78s)]
*  Yeah, but okay, let's theoretically say, [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8926.98s)]
*  all right, we believe it. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8930.62s)]
*  Like, they didn't use their inside information. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8931.58s)]
*  It almost doesn't matter. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8933.78s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8934.7s)]
*  Because ultimately, the bottom line is, [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8935.54s)]
*  people fucking think that you used your information [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8937.380000000001s)]
*  and are benefiting from it. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8939.94s)]
*  And by the way, when you look overall, [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8942.12s)]
*  like you could look at any individual trade [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8944.58s)]
*  and be like, oh, maybe, maybe not. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8946.220000000001s)]
*  Who knows? [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8948.380000000001s)]
*  But when you look at the numbers overall [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8949.220000000001s)]
*  and you're like, all you motherfuckers [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8950.62s)]
*  are beating the market, no fucking way. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8952.220000000001s)]
*  Unusual whales. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8955.820000000002s)]
*  And if you look at the actual speculation, [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8956.66s)]
*  the actual sales and trades, [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8958.42s)]
*  they fucking know, they know something. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8961.900000000001s)]
*  And they're not doing anything about it. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8965.1s)]
*  Unusual whales, shout out to him. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8966.34s)]
*  He's really one of the guys who sparked [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8967.62s)]
*  this whole movement. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8968.960000000001s)]
*  Who is Unusual Whales? [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8969.800000000001s)]
*  He's like an anonymous Twitter account [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8970.900000000001s)]
*  and he's one of the first people who actually published. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8973.02s)]
*  Independent journalist type. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8974.5s)]
*  But he's a Twitter. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8976.1s)]
*  He published the first trading, [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8976.94s)]
*  this was like 2021, maybe 2020 actually, [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8977.78s)]
*  were some of the first people who actually picked it up [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8980.9s)]
*  originally about the congressional trading numbers. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8983.34s)]
*  And we went through the exact Senate [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8985.1s)]
*  and he loops it all together as an institution [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8986.34s)]
*  and the way that it was able to beat the market [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8988.460000000001s)]
*  consistently year after year after. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8990.66s)]
*  And this is all publicly available data. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8992.86s)]
*  Shout out to him. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8994.94s)]
*  He's a great dude. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8995.78s)]
*  Yeah, definitely give him a follow. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8996.6s)]
*  He's really. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8997.7s)]
*  He does really good work. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8999.02s)]
*  And it's a lot. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=8999.86s)]
*  Yeah, you can actually see it all right there. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9000.7s)]
*  The full trading report on politicians in 2022. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9001.62s)]
*  And again, totally bipartisan. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9004.1s)]
*  Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Patrick Fallon, [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9006.18s)]
*  Susie Lee, David Joyce, Gary Peters, [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9007.78s)]
*  all look at the blue and the red there, [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9009.619999999999s)]
*  all within the graph. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9011.46s)]
*  And you can even see like, look, it's everybody. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9012.9s)]
*  Like from all across the board, [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9015.86s)]
*  people who are supposedly against the system, [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9017.86s)]
*  people who are totally within the system. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9019.78s)]
*  And that's what makes it so disgusting. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9021.94s)]
*  We have got to ban this. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9024.22s)]
*  90.8%, what does that mean? [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9026.619999999999s)]
*  Well, she was down to 28%. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9028.9s)]
*  And that's the other thing with Paul Pelosi, [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9031.46s)]
*  the guy is extraordinarily leveraged. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9032.74s)]
*  Like he's always trading options. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9034.820000000002s)]
*  He's not even just buying and selling individual stocks. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9036.300000000001s)]
*  He's making much larger bets on these things. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9038.78s)]
*  I mean, he's got $100 million in access to shit [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9041.5s)]
*  you and I don't have. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9043.960000000001s)]
*  Wait, Debbie Wasserman Schultz at the top there. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9045.18s)]
*  She's doing well. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9047.54s)]
*  Nice little portfolio return. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9048.380000000001s)]
*  I don't even know who that is. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9049.220000000001s)]
*  Look at that, 51% on a year over year in 2022. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9050.060000000001s)]
*  Nothing to see here. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9054.300000000001s)]
*  Crazy, I mean, if you compare that to the S&P 500, [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9055.140000000001s)]
*  I actually be curious or what the 2022 S&P, [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9057.380000000001s)]
*  yeah, there you go. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9059.78s)]
*  So S&P 500 is down 18%. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9060.62s)]
*  Look at every single one of these individual members [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9063.22s)]
*  who are able to have portfolios [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9066.099999999999s)]
*  which are beating the total market. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9067.64s)]
*  This is outrageous. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9069.66s)]
*  Pelosi's off her game now, look at that. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9070.5s)]
*  She's actually off her game. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9071.9s)]
*  It's like they threw just cause everybody was on to their shit. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9072.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9075.42s)]
*  They fucking threw it. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9076.26s)]
*  But look at the red and blue. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9077.099999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9079.58s)]
*  It's bipartisan, 100%. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9080.42s)]
*  And the top is red. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9082.539999999999s)]
*  Well, and this is like a story of like hope [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9084.22s)]
*  and it's very depressing [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9087.74s)]
*  because there was a whole grassroots movement [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9089.18s)]
*  to be like bipartisan. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9093.220000000001s)]
*  The Republicans were pissed off about Pelosi [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9095.42s)]
*  and Democrats were pissed off about the Republicans. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9097.58s)]
*  They're like, everyone was like, [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9099.74s)]
*  all right, this is fucked up, right? [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9100.58s)]
*  Any thinking person who cares about the country would be like, [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9102.02s)]
*  this is fucked up, why are we doing this? [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9104.6s)]
*  And so then because there's this organic movement, [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9106.1s)]
*  you see actually some people [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9110.56s)]
*  in the mainstream press start to cover it. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9112.14s)]
*  There was actually a reporter at Insider. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9113.58s)]
*  They started digging into the details of these trades [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9115.64s)]
*  and compiling reports. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9118.36s)]
*  That leads to that, when you're talking about Nancy Pelosi [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9119.800000000001s)]
*  at that press conference, [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9122.320000000002s)]
*  that leads to her actually getting asked a question about it. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9123.28s)]
*  And wasn't it incredibly revealing [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9125.880000000001s)]
*  her response in that moment? [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9128.560000000001s)]
*  That leads to a backlash. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9130.44s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy sees an opportunity [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9131.76s)]
*  with Republicans about to take it. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9133.720000000001s)]
*  He starts posh and like, oh, if Republicans take the house, [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9134.76s)]
*  we're gonna do the stock ban. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9137.220000000001s)]
*  Of course, they haven't said shit about that since then. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9138.300000000001s)]
*  Pelosi actually feels some pressure like, [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9140.6s)]
*  all right, we're gonna try a thing. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9142.68s)]
*  And they sort of like poison pill that [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9144.84s)]
*  to make sure it doesn't happen too. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9146.28s)]
*  And that's where the, it's a mixed bag. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9148.28s)]
*  Cause you're like, all right, we got it on the menu. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9150.36s)]
*  There was a lot of pressure, politicians heard it. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9152.24s)]
*  They had to do something. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9154.52s)]
*  But then both parties again, [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9156.36s)]
*  found ways to just completely let the issue slide [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9158.16s)]
*  and not actually have to change anything. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9161.6s)]
*  That is an independent media story though, [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9163.28s)]
*  because that's one of those where that guy publish it. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9164.76s)]
*  We started talking, this is not just us. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9166.6s)]
*  This is a lot of people, Dave Portnoy. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9167.92s)]
*  There's a lot of other people out there [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9169.4s)]
*  who've talked about it. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9170.880000000001s)]
*  A lot of independent media people like you [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9171.72s)]
*  have also brought it up. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9172.960000000001s)]
*  That kind of put it in the cultural pop culture conversation. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9174.24s)]
*  You got Tik Tokers out there doing Pelosi trades. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9177.08s)]
*  Like they have huge accounts where Gen Z [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9179.76s)]
*  and millennials are totally bought into. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9181.96s)]
*  How corrupt the system is. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9184.039999999999s)]
*  That floats upward with the outrage. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9185.28s)]
*  Insider picks it up. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9187.76s)]
*  And president Biden actually originally had a line [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9189.039999999999s)]
*  in his state of the union just last year [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9191.56s)]
*  where he was going to endorse [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9193.68s)]
*  a congressional stock trading ban. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9194.96s)]
*  The line was pulled at the very last minute. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9196.44s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9198.52s)]
*  Of all the things, you know, you listen to those [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9199.36s)]
*  state of the, it's like a laundry list [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9200.88s)]
*  of check in the box on every fucking thing. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9202.64s)]
*  25 check boxes. [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9204.8s)]
*  And that's the line that gets pulled. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9206.32s)]
*  Amazing, right? [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9208.8s)]
*  At whose request? [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9209.64s)]
*  That's a great question. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9210.48s)]
*  I would love for somebody in the press to dig into that. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9211.4s)]
*  And you know, Biden, to his credit, [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9213.16s)]
*  when he was a senator, [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9215.96s)]
*  he actually had a personal role for himself. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9217.32s)]
*  He did not engage in this. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9219.88s)]
*  He did not buy and sell stock. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9222.24s)]
*  So he would actually have a place of moral authority [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9225.119999999999s)]
*  to say like, let's not do this anymore. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9227.8s)]
*  But somebody got to him. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9229.88s)]
*  Wow. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9231.6s)]
*  That's a real corruption story. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9233.48s)]
*  Dirty business. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9234.96s)]
*  Well, and again, like Republican, you know, [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9236.16s)]
*  all these people like the Republican holdouts [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9238.0s)]
*  or Kevin McCarthy, posturing like populist or whatever. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9240.0s)]
*  This was not one of the demands that they made [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9242.359999999999s)]
*  of like, let's get stock trading. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9245.48s)]
*  Should have made that demand. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9246.48s)]
*  They should have made it, [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9247.32s)]
*  but you know, there's a reason why they didn't. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9248.16s)]
*  And like I said- [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9249.64s)]
*  It needs to be more public outrage. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9250.48s)]
*  Well, we're talking about it right now. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9251.439999999999s)]
*  Maybe it'll help. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9252.4s)]
*  Honestly, I really, there's a lot of Republican lawmakers [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9253.24s)]
*  who are obsessed with the JRE. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9255.56s)]
*  Maybe they'll listen to this. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9256.96s)]
*  There you go. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9257.88s)]
*  Make your pitch. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9258.72s)]
*  I mean, and like I said, McCarthy, [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9259.539999999999s)]
*  he brought it up at a moment [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9261.84s)]
*  when he thought it would serve him politically. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9263.199999999999s)]
*  But then the moment he actually got the gavel in sick power, [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9264.72s)]
*  nothing. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9268.56s)]
*  That's the key to getting what you want in politics though. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9269.4s)]
*  That's, you know, look, these people, [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9271.92s)]
*  they're never gonna do anything [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9273.439999999999s)]
*  because it's the right thing. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9274.279999999999s)]
*  You gotta force them to do it [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9275.119999999999s)]
*  so that it's politically advantageous. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9276.119999999999s)]
*  And look, there's actually a lot of room [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9277.56s)]
*  for some politician out there. [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9279.519999999999s)]
*  Originally, I think it was John Ossoff, [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9281.039999999999s)]
*  the Senator from Georgia. [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9282.76s)]
*  He was, he's a young guy. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9283.84s)]
*  He's like 30 something. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9284.96s)]
*  He's like maybe like 37, relatively young. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9286.039999999999s)]
*  He, I guarantee you, he's pretty online [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9288.48s)]
*  from what I can tell. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9290.519999999999s)]
*  He was the one who caught this. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9291.48s)]
*  He goes, oh, I'll just introduce a bill to ban this. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9292.539999999999s)]
*  He got a ton of good press for being the first Senator [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9294.24s)]
*  to actually propose a ban. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9297.6s)]
*  So we need to make it and create a system [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9299.08s)]
*  where right now it's politically advantageous [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9300.8s)]
*  to sell out to K Street, which is the lobbyist. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9302.88s)]
*  That's where they all sell out to big business, [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9305.4s)]
*  Wall Street, Military Industrial Complex, [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9307.44s)]
*  any of these people. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9309.68s)]
*  I think what I would love to do, [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9310.84s)]
*  and you know, one of the aims of the show [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9312.44s)]
*  was creating and rise with independent media [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9315.36s)]
*  and working with everybody, [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9317.92s)]
*  is to create an alternate system [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9319.119999999999s)]
*  where you get rewarded for. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9321.0s)]
*  We had a big conversation about Ukraine. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9323.0s)]
*  Just let one politician say it. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9325.08s)]
*  Right now we've had like maybe two [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9326.92s)]
*  who've ever raised any questions. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9328.76s)]
*  Rand Paul was one of the old people. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9330.0s)]
*  He goes, I'm not gonna even vote against the aid [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9331.48s)]
*  for Ukraine. [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9333.92s)]
*  Let's just have an auditor to make sure [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9334.76s)]
*  that it's all being spent. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9336.8s)]
*  Like an inspector general. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9337.64s)]
*  Nothing. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9339.08s)]
*  They don't even vote for that. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9339.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9340.92s)]
*  And by the way, like what did we just talk about? [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9341.76s)]
*  Zelensky just fired like half of his cabinet [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9343.28s)]
*  for corruption allegations. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9345.9s)]
*  Who do you think's paying the cabinet? [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9347.28s)]
*  Who's paying all the bills? [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9348.68s)]
*  We're balance, we're literally balancing their budget. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9350.04s)]
*  The United States Congress is. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9352.44s)]
*  Which is like, their economy is completely propped up [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9354.04s)]
*  by the United States. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9358.2s)]
*  And it might lead us to World War III. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9359.28s)]
*  That's possible. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9360.880000000001s)]
*  Certainly possible. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9361.84s)]
*  But when we were talking about Ukraine, [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9363.24s)]
*  one of the things that I wanted to bring up that I didn't, [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9365.060000000001s)]
*  is there a solution? [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9367.02s)]
*  Like if we're not gonna donate tanks and missiles and jets, [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9370.24s)]
*  what is the rational solution? [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9375.0s)]
*  Is there a way to mitigate the loss of life? [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9378.1s)]
*  Is there a way to negotiate a way out of this? [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9381.24s)]
*  Is there a way on paper other than Russia saying you win? [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9384.68s)]
*  What is the way? [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9390.0s)]
*  Well, the way would be, look, [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9391.28s)]
*  these are the conditions, Ukraine, [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9393.28s)]
*  at which we are gonna support you. [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9395.22s)]
*  After that, we are not going to provide you offensive aid [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9396.96s)]
*  because we believe that we should have [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9401.4s)]
*  a diplomatic solution. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9402.98s)]
*  You could convene. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9404.3s)]
*  I mean, look, there's been no real effort [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9405.32s)]
*  between President Biden and Vladimir Putin [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9406.98s)]
*  to actually even sit down. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9408.76s)]
*  Right now, there's all these EU G7 leaders [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9410.22s)]
*  that are actually inside of Ukraine. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9413.3s)]
*  None of them are asking any questions about diplomacy. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9415.22s)]
*  It's very, really what it is, [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9418.64s)]
*  is this is a grand European NATO problem. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9420.24s)]
*  So we all need to sit down together and hash it out. [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9422.82s)]
*  And look, if the Russians pull out of them, [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9425.42s)]
*  that then okay, like game on. [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9427.26s)]
*  Like you're the ones who are pulling out. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9429.179999999998s)]
*  You're the ones who are saying [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9430.9s)]
*  that we're not gonna have any engagement on this whatsoever. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9432.099999999999s)]
*  But we haven't even tried that. [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9434.679999999998s)]
*  It was in the very beginning of the war, [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9436.179999999998s)]
*  we actually, there were some negotiations [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9437.46s)]
*  that were happening. [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9439.22s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9440.06s)]
*  I'm not gonna pretend this would be like easy. [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9441.439999999999s)]
*  Like, oh, put me in there. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9443.279999999999s)]
*  And I like make it, and that's like the shit [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9444.66s)]
*  that Trump is truthing now. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9446.38s)]
*  He's like, we'll get a deal on day one. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9447.9s)]
*  24 hours out of the PC. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9449.779999999999s)]
*  Very easy to do. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9450.74s)]
*  It's like, you're ridiculous. [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9451.58s)]
*  Like, it's not easy to do. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9453.179999999998s)]
*  It's a complex situation, be incredibly difficult. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9454.359999999999s)]
*  There may be no opening for diplomacy, especially right now. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9456.74s)]
*  But Sager is right to point to the fact [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9460.06s)]
*  that early on in this conflict, [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9463.08s)]
*  there actually were meetings happening [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9465.14s)]
*  between Russian officials and Ukrainian representatives. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9467.38s)]
*  There were talks that were happening. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9471.339999999998s)]
*  And reportedly, they were kind of working out an outline. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9473.3s)]
*  There were still some very difficult sticking points, [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9477.74s)]
*  based on the reporting that's available. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9480.38s)]
*  And Boris Johnson, who was at that point [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9482.939999999999s)]
*  Prime Minister of the UK, [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9485.539999999999s)]
*  and of course they have been our closest ally [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9486.859999999999s)]
*  in all of this, was dispatched to go to Kiev [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9488.9s)]
*  and give the message to Tuzelinsky. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9492.439999999999s)]
*  This was reported actually in Ukrainian press. [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9494.42s)]
*  And he said, we do not want you to make a deal. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9498.14s)]
*  That was our posture. [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9501.460000000001s)]
*  We do not want diplomacy. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9502.9s)]
*  We do not want negotiations. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9504.380000000001s)]
*  So the thing that I object to is the idea [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9506.460000000001s)]
*  that is sold by Biden and others of like, [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9509.7s)]
*  oh, it's just up to Ukraine. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9512.300000000001s)]
*  That's bullshit. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9514.9s)]
*  They are where they are, 100% because of us. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9516.5s)]
*  This is an incredibly dangerous situation [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9520.26s)]
*  because of the proxy nature of it, [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9522.98s)]
*  because Russia certainly sees themselves [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9525.02s)]
*  as a proxy war versus us. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9527.539999999999s)]
*  And so the idea that we have no say and no influence [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9528.74s)]
*  over whether or not there are negotiations [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9533.74s)]
*  is completely bunk. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9535.94s)]
*  And so, that's the piece where my other concern [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9537.66s)]
*  is that we're sort of building up [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9542.58s)]
*  to another Afghanistan situation where, [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9544.42s)]
*  we went in with one goal, like, okay, [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9547.22s)]
*  we're gonna get the bad guys, we're gonna get Osama. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9548.699999999999s)]
*  And then when we failed at that, [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9550.94s)]
*  we end up with this 20 year occupation [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9553.14s)]
*  and total disaster at the end of it. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9556.28s)]
*  And no one can really say how or why [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9559.16s)]
*  we were there for so long. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9562.04s)]
*  Like, how do we get to some sort of exit ramp in Ukraine [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9563.28s)]
*  and that here the stakes are so much higher [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9566.480000000001s)]
*  because as you point out, it's like nuclear war [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9568.28s)]
*  and World War III on the line. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9570.800000000001s)]
*  And even if that's like a tiny chance, [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9572.24s)]
*  we should care a lot about that tiny chance. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9575.76s)]
*  Did you see Jimmy Dore on Tucker Carlson? [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9578.68s)]
*  Yes, yeah. [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9581.28s)]
*  What was he talking about, China? [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9582.12s)]
*  I think that's what it was. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9583.6s)]
*  I saw a clip that was floating around. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9584.44s)]
*  I didn't see it. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9585.28s)]
*  I don't know if you can play it. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9586.960000000001s)]
*  It was the other day, but he was talking [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9587.800000000001s)]
*  about the industrial military complex [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9589.960000000001s)]
*  and the influence that they have [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9592.36s)]
*  on what we're doing in the world. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9594.560000000001s)]
*  This idea that we're some sort of, have you found it? [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9597.36s)]
*  I don't wanna paraphrase it, but he went on this very, [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9601.84s)]
*  very powerful anti-war rant. [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9606.240000000002s)]
*  Let's play this one again. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9608.880000000001s)]
*  Should I use a different source first? [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9612.28s)]
*  Well, just try to. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9614.28s)]
*  I don't know what this channel is. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9615.119999999999s)]
*  I think it's on, Jamie, I'm pretty sure it's on his Twitter. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9616.44s)]
*  I thought I saw, on Jimmy's Twitter, [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9618.92s)]
*  I thought I saw a clip that was floating around there. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9621.52s)]
*  On Jimmy Dore's Twitter. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9623.8s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9624.8s)]
*  What was that one? [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9626.8s)]
*  The one I had? [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9628.36s)]
*  Yeah, it was something about China. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9629.199999999999s)]
*  It just, I don't know. [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9630.6s)]
*  That was the clip I knew that he was on, Tucker. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9631.76s)]
*  I knew he was there to talk about China. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9633.4s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9634.92s)]
*  There it is. There it is. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9636.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9636.88s)]
*  So play that. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9637.72s)]
*  We're the ones provoking this war, [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9644.8s)]
*  just like we provoked the war in Ukraine. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9646.8s)]
*  We are now provoking a war with China. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9649.44s)]
*  And what, who benefits? [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9651.64s)]
*  I'll tell you right now. [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9653.4s)]
*  Your enemy is not China. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9654.6s)]
*  Your enemy is not Russia. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9656.16s)]
*  Your enemy is the military industrial complex, [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9657.48s)]
*  which has been fleecing this country [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9660.16s)]
*  to the tunes of hundreds of billions and trillions of dollars. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9662.56s)]
*  How many times are we gonna have a defense secretary say, [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9665.52s)]
*  hey, we can't account for $2 trillion in the Pentagon again? [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9668.08s)]
*  That, like, which has happened twice now. [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9671.96s)]
*  So again, people are being, [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9675.16s)]
*  the war machine cannot be stopped. [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9677.12s)]
*  Who's running this country? [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9680.400000000001s)]
*  The war machine. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9681.84s)]
*  It certainly isn't Joe Biden making these decisions. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9682.68s)]
*  I would like to know who is making the decisions. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9685.0s)]
*  And I just want to remind everybody, [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9687.240000000002s)]
*  the United States is the world's terrorist. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9689.240000000002s)]
*  We just set the Middle East on fire in the last 20 years, [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9691.84s)]
*  and now we're doing a proxy war in Ukraine, [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9694.800000000001s)]
*  which we provoked, NATO provoked, [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9696.960000000001s)]
*  and it was just admitted that we provoked it [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9699.08s)]
*  by the former prime minister of Germany. [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9701.240000000002s)]
*  And now we're trying to saber-ratter with China, [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9703.52s)]
*  and they're predicting a war. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9706.08s)]
*  Again, China's not gonna invade us. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9708.08s)]
*  China's not our enemy. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9709.960000000001s)]
*  We might have an economic war. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9711.44s)]
*  That's what these are. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9713.16s)]
*  These are economic wars. [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9714.4s)]
*  These are wars for, in Ukraine, [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9715.92s)]
*  it's about liquefied natural gas [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9717.6s)]
*  and making sure Germany and Russia never come together, [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9719.16s)]
*  because we fear Russia's natural resources and manpower, [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9722.08s)]
*  and we fear them getting together with Germany [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9726.0s)]
*  with their technology and their capital. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9728.12s)]
*  And so that's why we blew up the Nord Stream pipeline. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9730.560000000001s)]
*  That's why we're doing the Ukraine War. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9732.8s)]
*  This is all about hegemony, imperialism, and economics. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9734.48s)]
*  And if there's a Marine somewhere, [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9738.8s)]
*  it's there because they're about to steal [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9740.519999999999s)]
*  some natural resources from another country. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9742.16s)]
*  As everybody's screaming about what a bad guy Putin is [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9744.279999999999s)]
*  for invading Ukraine, [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9747.08s)]
*  the United States is currently occupying a third of Syria. [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9748.679999999998s)]
*  And which third is that? [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9752.72s)]
*  It's the third that has the oil. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9753.96s)]
*  And how do I know we're there to steal their oil? [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9755.599999999999s)]
*  Because the president of the United States said so. [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9757.92s)]
*  And we're not even benefiting economically. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9761.48s)]
*  That's, I mean, of course that's the rub. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9764.359999999999s)]
*  Jimmy Dore, I appreciate it. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9766.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9767.039999999999s)]
*  Nord Stream, man. [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9768.8s)]
*  I forgot about that one. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9769.8s)]
*  You remember how immediately people were like, [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9771.359999999999s)]
*  oh, it was Russia, all of that. [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9773.76s)]
*  And then an independent panel actually just came out, [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9775.6s)]
*  I wanna say a month ago, [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9778.0s)]
*  and they're like, no, we don't think it was Russia. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9779.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9780.64s)]
*  I was like, well, who was it? [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9781.48s)]
*  They're like, we may never know. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9782.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9783.76s)]
*  Like, oh, really? [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9784.6s)]
*  Well, it's really only a few people who could have done it. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9785.439999999999s)]
*  We never know. [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9786.64s)]
*  Yeah, we'll never know. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9787.8s)]
*  I mean, the bottom- [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9788.92s)]
*  We killed Epstein, we may never know. [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9789.92s)]
*  May never know. [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9791.48s)]
*  May never know. [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9792.48s)]
*  I mean, the bottom line is, [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9793.44s)]
*  like we've talked a lot about incentives. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9795.56s)]
*  What's the incentive for the people who make bombs? [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9798.04s)]
*  Like, they're trying to make money. [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9800.64s)]
*  So, and they're very influential. [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9802.08s)]
*  They donate a lot of money in Washington. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9804.12s)]
*  They go revolving door, [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9806.44s)]
*  not just from like government officials, [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9808.74s)]
*  but also they go on CNN and MSNBC and whatever, [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9811.34s)]
*  and it's never disclosed like, oh, and by the way, [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9814.800000000001s)]
*  this person is like on the board of Raytheon [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9816.6s)]
*  and happens to have a vested financial interest [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9818.36s)]
*  in what we ultimately do here. [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9820.44s)]
*  So, listen, it's at the core. [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9822.140000000001s)]
*  The profit motive is at the core of a lot [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9826.04s)]
*  of what happens in this country. [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9828.18s)]
*  It's Eisenhower's speech when he was leaving office. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9829.02s)]
*  That's it. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9831.08s)]
*  Yeah, it was interesting. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9831.92s)]
*  You know what's something crazy is that [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9832.74s)]
*  even the Navy secretary, we just covered this, [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9833.58s)]
*  he came out and was like, in a few months, [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9835.12s)]
*  we may have to choose between arming ourselves [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9836.960000000001s)]
*  and arming Ukraine. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9839.04s)]
*  And then the Biden administration made him come up [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9840.28s)]
*  and quote, clear up that comment. [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9842.62s)]
*  He's like, oh, I didn't mean it that way. [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9844.52s)]
*  Well, no, he actually did mean it that way [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9846.92s)]
*  because it turns out that we've been sending [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9848.400000000001s)]
*  so many munitions and stuff that we have over to Ukraine. [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9849.94s)]
*  Yeah, there you go. [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9853.980000000001s)]
*  If the defense industry can't boost production, [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9854.820000000002s)]

*  where military industrial complex, [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9866.560000000001s)]
*  one of the things that we forget [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9868.6s)]
*  is they're not actually particularly good at what they do. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9869.6s)]
*  If we look at the F-35 program, it was a colossal disaster. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9871.86s)]
*  It was over a trillion dollars. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9875.160000000002s)]
*  It costs way too much money. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9876.52s)]
*  The US, I wanna say it was the Zumwalt class, [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9879.560000000001s)]
*  a new, Navy people are gonna freak out at me, [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9882.12s)]
*  but it was either a destroyer or something. [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9885.76s)]
*  It was supposed to be a new generation ship. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9887.6s)]
*  We were gonna build like dozens of them. [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9889.26s)]
*  We only ended up building three. [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9891.44s)]
*  They cost a shitload of money. [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9892.640000000001s)]
*  The gun costs a million dollars a round in order to fire it. [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9894.0s)]
*  So we're not able to even produce what we need. [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9898.720000000001s)]
*  This was a big fight during the Iraq War II [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9902.36s)]
*  where guys in the Pentagon would rather fund [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9904.32s)]
*  boondoggle programs than stuff that was actually protecting [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9907.08s)]
*  the lives of our soldiers like MRAPs. [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9909.699999999999s)]
*  They didn't wanna fund some of the stuff [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9912.64s)]
*  that was actually protecting American soldiers [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9914.84s)]
*  on the ground in Afghanistan. [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9917.32s)]
*  In Iraq, the A-10 Warthog is another good example. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9918.64s)]
*  Cheap Plane, which actually has ability to assist people [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9921.16s)]
*  in a tactical situation [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9924.199999999999s)]

*  ridiculous flying shit. [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9927.119999999999s)]
*  And Jimmy also points to the correct thing, [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9929.1s)]
*  which is the Pentagon did just fail, it's fucking audit. [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9930.76s)]
*  We don't really talk about that. [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9933.2s)]
*  Like a hundred billion dollars [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9934.560000000001s)]
*  that they have no idea what it is. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9935.640000000001s)]
*  Every year. [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9936.960000000001s)]
*  They fail it every year. [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9938.36s)]
*  It's a congressionally mandated audit. [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9940.16s)]
*  Every other government agency is able to [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9942.16s)]
*  get through their audit. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9945.960000000001s)]
*  And the Pentagon, there you go, [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9947.44s)]
*  fails its audit for the fifth time. [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9949.36s)]
*  There's no consequences to this either. [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9951.880000000001s)]
*  They're getting more money than ever. [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9953.68s)]
*  What are you spending it on? [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9955.04s)]
*  Not in close. [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9956.52s)]
*  It's not like they're off by a few pennies. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9957.44s)]
*  It's by like a few trillions or something. [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9959.2s)]
*  And everyone's just like, yeah. [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9963.24s)]
*  Where do you think that money's gone? [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9964.640000000001s)]
*  This is fine. [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9965.480000000001s)]
*  That's a great question. [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9966.320000000002s)]
*  There you go. [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9967.24s)]
*  Representing seven trillion dollars in assets. [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9968.28s)]
*  That's what we spent on the war on terror, [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9973.560000000001s)]
*  just so people know. [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9974.92s)]
*  The entire GWOT was seven trillion dollars. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9975.76s)]
*  And that's what's missing there. [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9977.880000000001s)]
*  I'm actually, I'm reading the sentence wrong. [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9978.720000000001s)]
*  The seven trillion is the part they were able [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9979.960000000001s)]
*  to give a clean bill of financial. [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9981.44s)]
*  That was only 39%. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9982.800000000001s)]
*  It was actually much more than seven trillion. [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9984.12s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9986.04s)]
*  So 40% is seven trillion, [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9987.2s)]
*  then we're double it. [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9988.68s)]
*  It's quite a system we have here. [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9989.52s)]
*  Okay, so yeah, we're talking about [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9990.36s)]
*  like almost nine trillion dollars. [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9991.2s)]
*  That's more than we spent on the entire GWOT. [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9993.039999999999s)]
*  Our entire economy is 15 trillion dollars. [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9994.92s)]
*  I want people to let that sink in. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9997.48s)]
*  But we can't have healthcare. [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=9999.119999999999s)]
*  That'd be too much. [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10000.68s)]
*  It costs too much. [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10001.64s)]
*  Can't do it. [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10002.56s)]
*  No universal basic income. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10003.4s)]
*  We can't afford it. [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10004.22s)]
*  Yeah, we can't afford that. [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10005.06s)]
*  Where's that money going though? [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10005.9s)]
*  Who knows? [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10006.96s)]
*  I read once that they have one of the largest HR systems [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10007.8s)]
*  in the entire world. [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10010.119999999999s)]
*  And I was like, on what? [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10011.08s)]
*  What are they spending that on? [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10012.48s)]
*  A lot of it, look, I have no idea. [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10014.2s)]
*  That's the point. [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10016.28s)]
*  Even with terms of Ukraine, [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10017.119999999999s)]
*  there was a great, this is a great media episode. [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10018.52s)]
*  CBS News did a whole documentary [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10020.28s)]
*  about how many of the weapons that we were sending [[02:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10022.24s)]
*  to Ukraine were not making it to the front line. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10024.12s)]
*  Which is bullshit, right? [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10026.12s)]
*  Because if we're gonna take all these weapons, [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10027.04s)]
*  I would at least hope a Ukrainian soldier [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10028.68s)]
*  is using it to protect his own life. [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10031.08s)]
*  Literally, the day after that documentary went live, [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10033.44s)]
*  he had to delete it. [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10036.400000000001s)]
*  CBS News retracted it and said, [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10037.320000000002s)]
*  no, actually the situation has changed. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10039.16s)]
*  It's not true. [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10041.0s)]
*  That report was out of context. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10042.0s)]

*  There's no, we have no way to independently verify [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10052.16s)]
*  that anything that we send to Ukraine [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10055.64s)]
*  is actually being used by Ukraine [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10057.56s)]

*  How much money have we sent over there? [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10059.800000000001s)]
*  In terms of how much we've actually spent. [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10061.92s)]

*  If you wanna look it up, Jamie, [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10064.92s)]

*  There's a tracker that does country by country [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10068.64s)]

*  I believe we have spent, [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10074.44s)]

*  Here's another crazy thing, [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10083.16s)]
*  because we actually read these laws [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10084.16s)]

*  It has already been appropriated. [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10107.8s)]
*  We have no way as a population to push back against that. [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10109.72s)]
*  Congress abdicated its responsibility in this case. [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10113.08s)]
*  Or he could not wake up tomorrow [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10116.119999999999s)]
*  and then it'd all be in the hands of fucking Kamala Harris. [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10118.56s)]
*  That's the only thing that scares me more. [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10121.0s)]
*  Can you imagine that lady with her finger on the button? [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10122.84s)]
*  We're fucked. [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10124.72s)]
*  His 80 year old heart is the only thing [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10126.039999999999s)]
*  keeping us alive right now. [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10127.88s)]
*  At least Biden stood up to the generals [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10128.96s)]
*  when it came to Afghanistan. [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10131.759999999998s)]
*  At least he had that in him. [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10132.96s)]
*  Kamala, scary. [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10134.599999999999s)]
*  Scary shit. [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10137.84s)]
*  You know she would start a war with Russia. [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10138.759999999998s)]
*  Do you think so? [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10140.24s)]
*  She'd bumble us into one. [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10141.08s)]
*  She's fucking, I mean, I think so. [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10141.92s)]
*  I think in terms of her competence, [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10143.48s)]
*  she cares about MSNBC. [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10145.199999999999s)]
*  She cares about group think. [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10146.96s)]
*  She cares about the elites, like really loving her. [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10148.56s)]
*  Biden to his credit on some areas of foreign policy [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10151.4s)]
*  is willing to buck that a little bit. [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10154.84s)]
*  It's very easy to be manipulated by these people [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10156.24s)]
*  because you see what happened [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10159.0s)]
*  when Biden pulled down of Afghanistan. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10161.199999999999s)]
*  And I acknowledge it was a mess. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10163.72s)]
*  It was a disaster. [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10165.8s)]
*  It was ugly. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10166.759999999998s)]
*  It was not good, all of that. [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10168.44s)]
*  But you see the way that they came out in force [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10169.76s)]
*  because they hated this decision. [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10173.76s)]
*  They wanted us to continue to be there forever [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10175.0s)]
*  because this was like the endless gravy train for them. [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10176.640000000001s)]
*  And so that was the most effective, [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10178.880000000001s)]
*  most potent criticism against it. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10181.84s)]
*  It was uniform across the board with the media. [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10183.32s)]
*  And so they did the same sort of stuff too. [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10186.0s)]
*  They'll leak against you. [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10190.16s)]
*  They'll really damage your approval rating. [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10191.84s)]
*  They're really tied in with the media [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10194.16s)]
*  in terms of like, you know, [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10195.96s)]
*  they're leaking to their sources [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10197.24s)]
*  and they will go on and make their own case, et cetera, [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10198.88s)]
*  with no disclosure that they have financial incentives [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10201.88s)]
*  involved. [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10203.8s)]
*  So it's very, very easy to be manipulated [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10204.64s)]
*  by the people who want to be in a place forever [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10207.88s)]
*  or want to start a war or whatever it is. [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10210.679999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10212.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10213.32s)]
*  I mean, I think Trump was subject to the same forces. [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10214.16s)]
*  Obama was subject to the same force. [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10217.96s)]
*  And I think part of why Biden in this limited instance [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10219.4s)]
*  was able to buck that trend is maybe perhaps [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10222.76s)]
*  just because he's been around for so fucking long. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10226.92s)]
*  Obama got totally rolled by the generals. [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10228.96s)]
*  Great book, Bob Woodward, Obama's Wars [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10230.8s)]
*  about the very first year of the Obama presidency. [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10232.8s)]
*  He promised to run on the good war Afghanistan, [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10235.519999999999s)]
*  but he's not necessarily wedded to a surge. [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10238.4s)]
*  The Obama's Wars book just details how [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10240.56s)]
*  Biden was the only guy in there being like, [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10242.92s)]
*  Mr. President, what the fuck are we doing in Afghanistan? [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10244.4s)]
*  What should we be? [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10246.88s)]
*  He's like, why should we send 40,000, whatever more troops? [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10247.72s)]
*  What are we gonna do? [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10251.0s)]
*  What's our end game? [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10251.82s)]
*  And he's like, what's our end game? [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10253.5s)]
*  What's our end game? [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10254.619999999999s)]
*  And what's our end game? [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10255.46s)]
*  And he's like, all right, [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10256.3s)]
*  let's just have a counterterrorism mission. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10257.3s)]
*  And David Petraeus, Mike Mullen, [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10259.14s)]
*  and all the other generals in the Obama White House [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10261.42s)]
*  were leaking against President Obama [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10263.619999999999s)]
*  and actually actively undercutting him [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10265.82s)]
*  to the New York Times and to the press [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10267.619999999999s)]
*  to create a Obama is soft on terrorism narrative [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10269.66s)]
*  specifically so they could do a surge in Afghanistan [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10273.06s)]
*  under Stanley McChrystal. [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10276.2s)]
*  And look, it's complicated, but if we look back on that, [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10277.58s)]
*  who were blown up during the surge in Afghanistan. [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10280.82s)]
*  And I also know how much it hurts them emotionally [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10283.6s)]
*  to watch ground that they fought [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10286.36s)]
*  and lost their brothers for, lost limbs for, [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10288.06s)]
*  get retaken by the Taliban several years earlier. [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10291.36s)]
*  It's just like what we're talking about with Ukraine. [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10294.199999999999s)]
*  What is the end game? [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10295.68s)]
*  And the end game is not something [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10297.66s)]
*  that Washington really likes to talk about. [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10299.48s)]
*  And even if you're looking at the pullout situation [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10301.48s)]
*  on Afghanistan, it's like, [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10303.92s)]
*  well, why should we stay in Afghanistan? [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10304.92s)]
*  If you were listening to the media, [[02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10306.52s)]
*  it was like, because so Afghan girls can go to school. [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10307.52s)]
*  And look, I feel very bad for Afghan girls. [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10309.859999999999s)]
*  I do not wish a situation [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10312.38s)]
*  where they are unable to go to school. [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10314.3s)]
*  Does that mean that we should have people there [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10315.779999999999s)]
*  in perpetuity and spend $200 million per day [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10317.22s)]
*  and have several American soldiers get blown up by an IED? [[02:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10319.74s)]
*  I'm sorry, I don't think so. [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10323.099999999999s)]
*  I think there's a lot of bad shit that's happening [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10324.14s)]
*  all across the world, [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10325.859999999999s)]
*  but they're never gonna frame it that way. [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10326.939999999999s)]
*  And that's why, man, the media on this, [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10328.42s)]
*  on war in particular, they offer no nuance. [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10330.74s)]
*  Afghanistan was a real red pill moment for Crystal and I [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10334.179999999998s)]
*  because, and look, I'm not defending it. [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10336.699999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying it wasn't a shit show. [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10338.259999999998s)]
*  What's the alternative? [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10340.6s)]
*  They were like, oh, we should have surrounded [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10341.44s)]
*  the city of Kabul. [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10342.28s)]
*  I'm like, so you wanna send thousands of American soldiers [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10343.1s)]
*  to create a perimeter around the city of Kabul? [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10345.0s)]
*  That suicide bomb that happened in the airport, [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10348.92s)]
*  it would have been that times 100 [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10350.92s)]
*  in terms of we were occupying and surrounding [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10352.560000000001s)]
*  an entire city. [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10354.94s)]
*  There are valid criticisms of, [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10355.78s)]
*  we should have held onto Bagram, [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10356.92s)]
*  we shouldn't have abandoned the military base or whatever [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10358.380000000001s)]
*  in that, and that's a tactical consideration. [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10362.28s)]
*  I'll leave that to the people whose job it is. [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10363.94s)]
*  But on a broader strategic level, [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10365.800000000001s)]
*  why should we have stayed in Afghanistan? [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10367.62s)]
*  And I haven't heard a particularly good answer to that. [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10369.9s)]
*  Well, you know how much they actually cared [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10371.34s)]
*  about the women and girls by the fact that [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10373.78s)]
*  now that those women and girls are starving [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10375.98s)]
*  and a mass famine, they don't give a shit. [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10378.34s)]
*  They don't cover it. [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10380.34s)]
*  They don't cover the fact that we're partly connected to it [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10381.18s)]
*  because of the fact that we are continuing [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10384.54s)]
*  to hold their central bank reserves. [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10387.220000000001s)]
*  And that's just, now we're over that. [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10388.7s)]
*  We've moved on. [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10391.92s)]
*  Now we're focused on humanitarian stories elsewhere. [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10392.76s)]
*  So it's just very selective [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10395.880000000001s)]
*  and it's weaponized humanitarian. [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10397.960000000001s)]
*  Because Americans are good people. [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10400.24s)]
*  People don't wanna see someone suffering. [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10401.76s)]
*  And so they'll use the legitimate humanitarian concerns [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10404.56s)]
*  to try to achieve their aims. [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10409.56s)]
*  And then once those aims are accomplished [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10411.12s)]
*  or not accomplished, well, they don't give a shit. [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10412.48s)]
*  Oof. [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10414.6s)]
*  This is not a rosy picture you two are painting. [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10415.84s)]
*  Well, it can be. [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10418.84s)]
*  We went from the stock band, [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10420.48s)]
*  which I thought was a rosy one. [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10421.56s)]
*  I wanted to talk to you about something [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10423.4s)]
*  that I remember you discussing [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10424.58s)]
*  that I wanted to get clarity on. [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10426.34s)]
*  What was that story that you discussed [[02:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10428.98s)]
*  where there was a company that was working with China [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10431.76s)]
*  and China had bought a large stake in the company. [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10435.699999999999s)]
*  It was about chips and AI. [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10437.66s)]
*  Okay, I forget the exact name of the company, Jamie, [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10439.779999999999s)]
*  but it's basically called the Heist of the Century. [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10442.779999999999s)]
*  If you Google like heist of the century, [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10445.619999999999s)]
*  China Semiconductors. [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10447.34s)]
*  I think it was called AML. [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10449.46s)]
*  It was a British semiconductor company. [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10450.939999999999s)]
*  Any American or Western business [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10453.060000000001s)]
*  is required to do business in China [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10454.820000000002s)]
*  has to have a Chinese subsidiary. [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10456.54s)]
*  So essentially what happened is [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10458.220000000001s)]
*  is the Chinese subsidiary, I believe of AML, [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10459.460000000001s)]
*  was stealing the technology from within it. [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10462.660000000002s)]
*  And after they were reprimanded for something like this, [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10465.140000000001s)]
*  the CEO of the Chinese subsidiary just said, [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10468.220000000001s)]
*  nope, I'm taking it. [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10470.980000000001s)]
*  He stole all of their IP, [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10472.12s)]
*  created an independent business [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10473.580000000002s)]
*  backed by the Chinese government [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10475.34s)]
*  and is now spinning up based on their IP, [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10476.7s)]
*  semiconductors that were originally intellectual property [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10479.140000000001s)]
*  of this British semiconductor company. [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10482.08s)]
*  And the reason that this matters is [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10484.279999999999s)]
*  that is just the tip of the iceberg for IP theft [[02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10486.08s)]
*  that is happening with respect to China. [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10490.26s)]
*  It's one of the reasons why if you look at Chinese [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10492.519999999999s)]
*  or American businessmen who do business over there, [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10495.68s)]
*  they fully and readily admit the amount of IP [[02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10498.0s)]
*  that has just been straight up stolen [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10500.5s)]
*  through their fake legal process of this Chinese subsidiary, [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10501.96s)]
*  but really it's just a farming operation. [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10505.039999999999s)]
*  There's no such thing as private industry in China. [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10507.119999999999s)]
*  I talk about with TikTok all the time, [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10509.76s)]
*  the CEO, Jiang Zemin, [[02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10511.9s)]
*  he actually was forced to pull one of ByteDance's apps [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10513.02s)]
*  from the Chinese app store and apologize [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10517.02s)]
*  because it was not supporting, quote, socialist principles. [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10519.52s)]
*  He was like, I apologize to the, [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10522.460000000001s)]
*  this is the CEO of TikTok today, the owner of TikTok. [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10524.1s)]
*  Everything there is totally controlled by the government. [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10528.060000000001s)]
*  They're very savvy and they're very smart. [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10531.58s)]
*  And at this point, they've actually even reached a point [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10533.7s)]
*  where in some cases, they don't even need our IP. [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10536.08s)]
*  In some areas, they are far more superior [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10539.380000000001s)]
*  and advanced than we are. [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10541.94s)]
*  One of the ones that scares the shit out of me [[02:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10542.900000000001s)]
*  is electric vehicle battery. [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10544.58s)]
*  So the entire EV battery supply chain [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10545.78s)]
*  is connected to China in some way. [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10548.62s)]
*  You've talked about the cobalt and all of that. [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10550.68s)]
*  And one of the things that Siddharth brought up on your show [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10552.82s)]
*  was that it's the Chinese companies [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10555.0s)]
*  that are working with these Congolese gangs. [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10556.26s)]
*  Chinese don't give a shit about labor. [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10558.26s)]
*  I mean, it's not like we give a shit either, so to be fair. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10559.66s)]
*  But anyway, they're willing to come in and be like, [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10562.04s)]
*  look, we want the cobalt, give it to us. [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10563.58s)]
*  This is actually part of the reason why Elon [[02:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10565.54s)]
*  is in a precarious position. [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10567.26s)]
*  A huge part of the Tesla EV battery supply chain is in China. [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10568.6s)]
*  Even here in the United States, [[02:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10572.56s)]
*  a lot of the new EV battery plants that are being built, [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10574.12s)]
*  it's a Chinese subsidiary and a conglomerate [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10577.4s)]
*  that is behind that. [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10579.94s)]
*  And look, what did we come through with the whole pandemic? [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10581.0s)]
*  If you're gonna have critical supplies [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10584.28s)]
*  being manufactured and connected to China in some way, [[02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10586.76s)]
*  they're always gonna put their interest, [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10589.88s)]
*  as any country should, above your own. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10591.4s)]
*  You need to have some sort of resilience. [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10593.76s)]
*  Taiwan is another example. [[02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10596.06s)]
*  TSMC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturer, [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10599.019999999999s)]
*  they are building a plant here in Arizona. [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10601.699999999999s)]
*  I think it's a $100 billion plant, which is great. [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10604.099999999999s)]
*  I'm glad that they are, [[02:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10606.9s)]
*  but it takes a decade to spin those things up. [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10607.82s)]
*  They create 92% of the world's most advanced chips. [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10609.82s)]
*  If we have a conflict in Taiwan, [[02:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10614.38s)]
*  I always talk about this on the show, [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10616.699999999999s)]
*  we are all turning this shit into the government [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10618.099999999999s)]
*  so that they can create missiles and bombs. [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10620.46s)]
*  They will literally need to rip the semiconductors [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10622.82s)]
*  and chips out of our cell phones, out of our computers, [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10625.34s)]
*  because we're not gonna have anything. [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10628.56s)]
*  92% of the world's most advanced chips, [[02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10630.28s)]
*  everything goes dark, [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10632.56s)]
*  everything is turned over into some sort of ration thing. [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10634.32s)]
*  Chips is the new gold. [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10637.56s)]
*  It is one of the most precarious as an industry [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10639.36s)]
*  for the United States that we remain in. [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10642.12s)]
*  The Chips Act was a great step in the right direction [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10643.880000000001s)]
*  that the Biden administration passed, [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10646.2s)]
*  but tip of the iceberg, man. [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10647.56s)]
*  That's a whole other level. [[02:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10649.56s)]
*  I mean, that is the, [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10650.8s)]
*  if we're looking for a more positive story, [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10652.32s)]
*  a more capitalist gloom and doom, [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10654.66s)]
*  the Biden administration has dipped their toe [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10657.06s)]
*  in the water of industrial policy, recognizing that. [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10659.5s)]
*  I mean, the best response to China, [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10663.26s)]
*  the problem for us is being so interdependent, [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10666.34s)]
*  where the pandemic, you come to realize, [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10669.140000000001s)]
*  oh fuck, they make all the masks. [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10672.380000000001s)]
*  Oh shit, they make all the like, yeah. [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10674.18s)]
*  And so there was, and then the other piece is, [[02:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10676.62s)]
*  we realized with these sprawling, [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10680.300000000001s)]
*  just-in-time supply chains [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10683.48s)]
*  that they were incredibly fragile, right? [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10685.24s)]
*  That if you have a disruption, [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10687.62s)]
*  your whole economy is like gonna go to shit. [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10689.52s)]
*  You're gonna have inflation. [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10691.6s)]
*  You're gonna have all these backups at the ports [[02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10692.44s)]
*  and all this stuff. [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10693.960000000001s)]
*  So they have dipped their toe in the water [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10695.48s)]
*  of having industrial policy that makes us more resilient, [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10699.2s)]
*  less reliant on these other countries, [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10702.56s)]
*  including the Inflation Reduction Act had a lot in it [[02:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10704.36s)]
*  for bringing that like green energy production [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10707.0s)]
*  and EV battery production to our shores [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10710.88s)]
*  and has requirements about like where those batteries [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10714.1s)]
*  are built and where the sourcing comes from. [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10716.460000000001s)]
*  But it really is just starting to dip your toe [[02:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10718.980000000001s)]
*  in those waters ultimately. [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10722.1s)]
*  We're more than a decade out. [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10723.66s)]
*  It's still so difficult. [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10724.74s)]
*  I mean, the sourcing on the EVs is such a nightmare. [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10725.74s)]
*  And if you're trying to get conflict-free cobalt [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10728.1s)]
*  or lithium, right now there's a huge battle right now [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10730.44s)]
*  in South America, in Mexico, in Chile, and elsewhere [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10732.94s)]
*  where Chinese companies are trying to buy [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10736.18s)]
*  all of the lithium deposits, [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10737.980000000001s)]
*  which of course you need for a lithium ion battery. [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10739.380000000001s)]
*  And if we also, I mean, look, this shit takes a long time. [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10742.74s)]
*  I think that's the one thing I want people to, [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10745.44s)]
*  you don't just snap your fingers [[02:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10747.039999999999s)]
*  and build a semiconductor fab. [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10748.08s)]
*  You need water. [[02:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10750.039999999999s)]
*  If a single human hair gets into the TSMC facility, [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10751.24s)]
*  the whole thing shuts down. [[02:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10754.6s)]
*  This is the most sophisticated manufacturing [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10755.96s)]
*  basically in the entire world. [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10758.94s)]
*  And we're trying to rebuild it overnight. [[02:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10760.4s)]
*  It's very, very, very difficult. [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10762.88s)]
*  And then even if you think about [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10765.119999999999s)]
*  from an infrastructure point of view, [[02:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10766.08s)]
*  so we have an explosion right now in electric vehicles. [[02:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10768.32s)]
*  I think that's great. [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10770.82s)]
*  I think EVs are really cool. [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10771.66s)]
*  They're really fun to drive. [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10773.38s)]
*  But if you don't have a Tesla, like where do you charge? [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10774.22s)]
*  You know, if you're driving long range, [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10775.98s)]
*  like where are you gonna charge it? [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10777.34s)]
*  It's not like we have a ton of EV battery stations. [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10778.26s)]
*  We need the infrastructure really badly. [[02:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10782.1s)]
*  The same gas station infrastructure that we all have, [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10783.98s)]
*  that's, we're decades behind on that. [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10787.019999999999s)]
*  So anyway, I would love for the US government [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10789.199999999999s)]
*  to intelligently invest in it. [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10792.359999999999s)]
*  And a lot of this is ideological. [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10794.619999999999s)]
*  So another thing with the inflation reduction [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10795.74s)]
*  has a bullshit name. [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10798.34s)]
*  Newsporters just called it like a clean energy bill, [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10799.18s)]
*  which probably would have pulled better [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10800.86s)]
*  than a fake inflation reduction. [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10802.08s)]
*  Whatever. [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10804.32s)]
*  That was Joe Manchin's innovation. [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10805.16s)]
*  One of the important things is ideology, right? [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10805.980000000001s)]
*  Which is not ideologically investing in technology [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10807.880000000001s)]
*  because we want it to work, but because it actually works. [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10809.92s)]
*  Nuclear is a huge part of this conversation. [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10811.720000000001s)]
*  We talked a ton about it on our show. [[03:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10813.52s)]
*  For a long time, we had tax credits, [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10816.04s)]
*  clean energy tax credits were only applicable [[03:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10817.800000000001s)]
*  to wind and solar. [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10819.960000000001s)]
*  Wind and solar are fine. [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10821.16s)]
*  I think they have a lot of problems. [[03:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10822.84s)]
*  Solar in particular is very filthy [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10824.5s)]
*  in order to manufacture. [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10826.08s)]
*  A lot of it is manufactured in China. [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10827.16s)]
*  And we actually rely on China to build. [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10828.880000000001s)]
*  You also need the batteries for it to be sustainable. [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10830.5s)]
*  For when the wind is not blowing [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10833.42s)]
*  and the sun is not shining. [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10835.06s)]
*  It's complicated. [[03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10836.7s)]
*  Whereas nuclear has like a 93% rate [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10837.539999999999s)]
*  at which it's always being able to run. [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10841.62s)]
*  It's actually even more powerful than natural gas. [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10843.42s)]
*  Very reliable. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10846.34s)]
*  Unfortunately, we haven't built a new nuclear power plant [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10847.24s)]
*  in the United States since 1974, which is insane, right? [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10850.38s)]
*  And luckily, California decided not to totally lose its mind [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10853.86s)]
*  and close the Diablo nuclear power plant. [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10857.3s)]
*  Here in Texas, I think only 13% or whatever [[03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10860.5s)]
*  of our power comes from nuclear. [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10862.34s)]
*  We get more power from coal, I believe, here in Texas, [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10865.3s)]
*  than we do from nuclear in the year 2023. [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10867.82s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10870.14s)]
*  The point is, is that even if we wanted to though, [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10871.66s)]
*  and this is the fair criticism, it takes a long time. [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10874.1s)]
*  But with all of these things, no time like the present. [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10876.24s)]
*  Like we gotta start now. [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10879.460000000001s)]
*  The current system is not working. [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10880.94s)]
*  Texas, a lot of the power just went out here in Austin. [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10883.18s)]
*  One of the reasons why, [[03:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10886.9s)]
*  from what I've been able to read so far, [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10888.44s)]
*  is that it's actually not the grid. [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10890.64s)]
*  It's because power lines are constructed above ground. [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10891.48s)]
*  And people are like, okay, well, why do we do that? [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10893.64s)]
*  It's cheap. [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10896.52s)]
*  It's a lot more expensive [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10897.34s)]
*  to have to bury these things underground. [[03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10898.72s)]
*  So it's a trade-off. [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10901.0s)]
*  And I think that's fair. [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10901.84s)]
*  It's a once in a three year or so event. [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10903.24s)]
*  But even if we look at the previous grid failure [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10905.46s)]
*  here in Texas, it was failure to weatherize [[03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10907.64s)]
*  the natural gas grid. [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10909.76s)]
*  So a lot of this stuff is preemptive investment [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10911.199999999999s)]
*  to make sure that old people don't die [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10914.56s)]
*  in the middle of a freeze. [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10917.199999999999s)]
*  That horrible situation like in Buffalo, right? [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10918.74s)]
*  Where people were losing power and freezing to death [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10920.86s)]
*  in their cars. [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10923.7s)]
*  That is why we need to have more forward thinking [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10924.82s)]
*  as a country and actually get some agreement [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10927.66s)]
*  about these things. [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10929.98s)]
*  And frankly, we're gonna have to throw [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10930.8s)]
*  a shitload of money at it. [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10931.619999999999s)]
*  It costs a lot of money. [[03:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10932.7s)]
*  But the idea that people say, [[03:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10934.18s)]
*  oh, but that's government subsidy. [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10935.86s)]
*  Listen, we subsidize the shit out of the oil industry. [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10939.34s)]
*  You really think we don't subsidize oil? [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10941.5s)]
*  Of course we do. [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10943.48s)]
*  It's critical energy infrastructure. [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10944.32s)]
*  There's so much regulation around it. [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10945.74s)]
*  You can't even get a new nuclear power plant approved [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10949.119999999999s)]
*  if you were to apply to, I think it's the FERC, [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10950.84s)]
*  it's like the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission. [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10953.199999999999s)]
*  So we need reform on all of these things [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10955.4s)]
*  just to make life better in America. [[03:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10957.68s)]
*  And unfortunately, a lot of it is just corrupted [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10960.18s)]
*  so that it's not really possible. [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10962.88s)]
*  And a lot of it is ideological too. [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10964.68s)]
*  We have to be honest about that. [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10966.0s)]
*  We have a lot of short-term thinking, [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10966.84s)]
*  a lot of profit-driven thinking, [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10969.279999999999s)]
*  and then that bleeds over into government officials as well [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10972.64s)]
*  because of the corporate campaign contributions. [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10975.66s)]
*  And so, yeah, they don't care really what happens [[03:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10978.66s)]
*  10 years from now or whether it's good for the US [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10983.099999999999s)]
*  or China or anyone else they care about. [[03:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10985.58s)]
*  Is it good for their bottom line? [[03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10987.939999999999s)]
*  It's crazy because all the things that we discussed, [[03:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10989.22s)]
*  healthcare, energy, all the issues that we have, [[03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10992.18s)]
*  and that's where it gets really crazy [[03:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10995.74s)]
*  when you look at the money [[03:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10998.14s)]
*  that we're putting into other things like Ukraine. [[03:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=10999.38s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11001.699999999999s)]
*  If we had the resources to do [[03:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11002.54s)]
*  what we're doing right now currently, [[03:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11005.400000000001s)]
*  that means we had the resources [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11007.400000000001s)]
*  to attack all these problems domestically. [[03:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11009.320000000002s)]
*  Right. Yeah, that's right. [[03:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11011.36s)]
*  But we just don't have consensus around it. [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11012.2s)]
*  With Ukraine, they snap their fingers. [[03:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11013.44s)]
*  They basically 99% of what they want. [[03:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11015.080000000002s)]
*  Nobody in Congress has the balls to actually vote against it. [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11017.480000000001s)]
*  I believe it was a unanimous vote, I think, [[03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11020.320000000002s)]
*  in the Senate, or semi-unanimous, or whatever. [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11022.28s)]
*  Here's the question about that. [[03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11024.320000000002s)]
*  Why are the Republicans opposed [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11025.52s)]
*  to sending more arms to Ukraine? [[03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11027.880000000001s)]
*  Are they, why aren't they more opposed? [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11029.68s)]
*  Why are they opposed? [[03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11032.26s)]
*  Because some Republicans are. [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11033.38s)]
*  Some are. [[03:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11034.539999999999s)]
*  Well, you can count them on one hand. [[03:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11035.38s)]
*  I mean, they might say it, but they all vote for it. [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11037.26s)]
*  I mean, how many of them actually voted against it? [[03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11039.22s)]
*  Jamie, you might be able to look it up, [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11041.5s)]
*  what the actual vote count was [[03:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11042.58s)]
*  on the extra 50 billion to Ukraine. [[03:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11043.82s)]
*  I'm not 100, or at least the original 50 billion, [[03:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11046.14s)]
*  it was almost unanimous in terms of what was sent over there. [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11048.3s)]
*  And look, I think a lot of them, [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11051.42s)]
*  what they're saying is a more financial perspective [[03:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11052.98s)]
*  of what you're talking about. [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11055.46s)]
*  They're like, hey, why should we spend [[03:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11056.3s)]
*  50 billion dollars to Ukraine [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11057.26s)]
*  if we have all of these problems here? [[03:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11058.42s)]
*  I mean, I don't necessarily agree 100% with that feeling. [[03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11060.32s)]
*  Yeah, 11 senators who voted against the Ukraine aid bill. [[03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11063.119999999999s)]
*  But that means that 86 of the entire chamber [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11066.48s)]
*  did end up voting for it. [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11069.08s)]
*  And if I were to look at it, [[03:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11071.08s)]
*  I would be willing to bet [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11072.199999999999s)]
*  a lot of them are fiscal Republicans. [[03:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11073.039999999999s)]
*  So Josh Hawley, Mike Brown, [[03:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11075.119999999999s)]
*  yeah, Boozman, Crapo, Haggerty, Lee, [[03:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11078.119999999999s)]
*  Loomis, Marshall, Tommy Turrell. [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11081.0s)]
*  These are mostly more libertarian types, [[03:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11082.64s)]
*  so they're gonna be more concerned on the spending side. [[03:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11084.16s)]
*  But you know, the critique that we've all talked about [[03:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11086.48s)]
*  here on the show today, [[03:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11089.12s)]
*  you will not hear a single word of this [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11090.460000000001s)]
*  in the mainstream. [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11093.720000000001s)]
*  I have not seen one intelligent discussion [[03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11094.78s)]
*  in any format of mainstream media on Ukraine [[03:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11097.980000000001s)]
*  raising any of the valid points that we just did, [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11101.58s)]
*  because the lobby and the denunciation of, [[03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11104.140000000001s)]
*  oh, you're pro-Russia, oh, you're spouting, [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11108.140000000001s)]
*  you have Putin talking points and all that, is vicious. [[03:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11110.740000000002s)]
*  And a lot of these people [[03:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11113.34s)]
*  just succumb to that, unfortunately. [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11114.54s)]
*  I really don't know how to get around it, [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11117.28s)]
*  but if I can have anything take away, [[03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11119.32s)]
*  is what you said is, [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11121.380000000001s)]
*  look, if people were willing to unanimously, [[03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11122.58s)]
*  relatively agree to send 100 billion to Ukraine, [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11125.720000000001s)]
*  and we have all these problems that we just talked about, [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11128.08s)]
*  that shows you what the priority is. [[03:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11130.5s)]
*  I always look at, [[03:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11131.74s)]
*  what's the bipartisan consensus in Washington? [[03:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11132.7s)]
*  That's the only shit that actually gets done. [[03:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11134.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, a perfect example. [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11136.24s)]
*  So we passed during the pandemic [[03:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11138.92s)]
*  this expanded child tax credit, [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11141.58s)]
*  phenomenally successful program, [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11144.62s)]
*  lifted half of all kids that were in poverty out of poverty. [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11146.82s)]
*  They did research on the way that parents were spending this. [[03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11152.380000000001s)]
*  They were spending it on their kids. [[03:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11155.66s)]
*  They were spending it on enrichment for their kids. [[03:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11157.1s)]
*  It was unanimously great policy that worked really well. [[03:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11159.7s)]
*  And Democrats, Republicans decided they were against it, [[03:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11164.86s)]
*  and Democrats just let it expire without a peep. [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11169.18s)]
*  And so again, it's like, [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11173.1s)]
*  you know, the hard thing is, [[03:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11175.640000000001s)]
*  so many people's political approach is so focused on [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11178.2s)]
*  like whatever the cultural outrage of the moment is, [[03:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11183.16s)]
*  that things like that don't even get surfaced. [[03:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11187.28s)]
*  They don't get debated. [[03:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11190.04s)]
*  They don't get discussed. [[03:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11190.880000000001s)]
*  And then this program, [[03:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11192.28s)]
*  which was one of the most successful programs [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11193.24s)]
*  we've done in a long time just dies. [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11194.6s)]
*  Oh, that reminds me. [[03:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11196.48s)]
*  I know you've been talking about UBI and concerns about it. [[03:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11197.32s)]
*  So we actually been doing a lot of deep dive into this. [[03:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11200.64s)]
*  And we looked at a couple of new studies. [[03:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11203.859999999999s)]
*  There's a new one actually just came out [[03:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11206.18s)]
*  that a big part of the quote labor shortage [[03:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11208.06s)]
*  is actually men who were working much longer hours [[03:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11210.34s)]
*  during the pandemic, cutting back on their hours. [[03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11214.14s)]
*  So it's not, and actually it's Matthew Iglesias [[03:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11217.359999999999s)]
*  tweeted this study. [[03:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11220.119999999999s)]
*  If you want to see it, Jamie, [[03:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11221.199999999999s)]
*  it's from the National Bureau of Economic Research. [[03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11222.22s)]
*  So it's a couple of things. [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11224.58s)]
*  It's a cut back in the amount of hours [[03:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11226.019999999999s)]
*  that people are willing to work. [[03:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11227.88s)]
*  Also, because 2020 with the initial reopening, [[03:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11229.2s)]
*  there was more labor ability to bargain. [[03:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11233.32s)]
*  Many people were not willing to go back to work [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11235.68s)]
*  at the same wages. [[03:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11237.74s)]
*  One of the concerns around unemployment [[03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11239.24s)]
*  I know that you would raise and others was, [[03:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11240.9s)]
*  oh, well people are getting all this unemployment. [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11243.2s)]
*  They're not going back to work. [[03:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11244.52s)]
*  And there were certainly some cases of that true, [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11245.68s)]
*  but we had a interesting natural experiment [[03:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11248.66s)]
*  where they actually ended unemployment benefits [[03:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11251.44s)]
*  back in 2021. [[03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11253.76s)]
*  It had little to no change on the overall employment rate. [[03:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11255.12s)]
*  So even when you took away the unemployment benefits, [[03:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11258.140000000001s)]
*  all of the anecdotal stories of like, [[03:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11260.78s)]
*  I can't get somebody in because they're getting unemployment. [[03:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11262.54s)]
*  They didn't want to work. [[03:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11264.980000000001s)]
*  Actually, when they stopped getting unemployment, [[03:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11265.92s)]
*  a lot of them didn't go back to work. [[03:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11267.820000000002s)]
*  And it wasn't just cause they had money saved up [[03:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11269.86s)]
*  because we know right now we have some of the highest credit [[03:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11271.660000000002s)]
*  card debt in modern American history, [[03:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11274.08s)]
*  which is never a good sign. [[03:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11276.44s)]
*  In fact, many bank accounts are below pre-pandemic levels. [[03:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11278.160000000002s)]
*  And so there's actually just been a fundamental reset [[03:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11281.62s)]
*  in the way, a cultural reset in the way that a lot of people [[03:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11284.140000000001s)]
*  approach work. [[03:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11287.44s)]
*  A lot of it is women. [[03:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11288.32s)]
*  One of the fascinating things that happened is we had, [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11289.48s)]
*  for the first time in modern American history, [[03:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11291.6s)]
*  we had an increase, actually, [[03:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11294.38s)]
*  in the amount of babies that were born. [[03:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11296.2s)]
*  The pandemic baby bump that happened from 2020 and 2021. [[03:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11298.0s)]
*  We've almost never had that happen before. [[03:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11302.12s)]
*  A lot of it were just during the pandemic. [[03:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11304.52s)]
*  People were bored and they had more time on, [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11305.76s)]
*  and they were able to plan pregnancy, be at home, [[03:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11307.9s)]
*  not have to worry about one week or whatever [[03:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11311.48s)]
*  of maternity leave. [[03:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11313.8s)]
*  So we're living in a really interesting moment [[03:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11314.76s)]
*  in the way that people have evaluated their relationship [[03:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11316.7s)]
*  with work. [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11319.26s)]
*  There's a real reorientation going on, [[03:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11320.1s)]
*  especially for like white collar workers [[03:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11322.220000000001s)]
*  who were very wrapped up in their like, [[03:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11324.62s)]
*  whatever their work dramas were, [[03:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11327.42s)]
*  and their whole life was centered around work [[03:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11328.9s)]
*  and climbing that ladder and whatever. [[03:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11331.74s)]
*  And so when they were forced to go remote [[03:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11333.34s)]
*  and all of that was stripped away, [[03:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11336.74s)]
*  was like, why is this the only part of my life [[03:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11338.5s)]
*  that I'm focusing on? [[03:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11342.74s)]
*  This thing that I don't even really like [[03:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11343.98s)]
*  when I have like a family, I have a community, [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11345.720000000001s)]
*  I have other things that are important to me. [[03:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11347.52s)]
*  And I don't think that that, [[03:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11349.76s)]
*  I think that is a dramatic mindset shift [[03:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11351.480000000001s)]
*  that is probably not going away, [[03:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11355.36s)]
*  like a cultural mindset shift. [[03:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11357.560000000001s)]
*  And you see all these people too, [[03:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11359.320000000002s)]
*  like moving to different areas, [[03:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11360.44s)]
*  valuing different things in terms of their quality of life. [[03:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11362.560000000001s)]
*  And so yeah, as we look at the labor force [[03:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11365.480000000001s)]
*  participation rate, a lot of the decline [[03:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11367.880000000001s)]
*  was actually people not leaving their jobs, [[03:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11370.720000000001s)]
*  not that they didn't wanna work, [[03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11373.04s)]
*  but just working fewer hours and being unwilling [[03:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11374.48s)]
*  to like just dedicate their entire waking life [[03:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11376.66s)]
*  to their job. [[03:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11380.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11381.5s)]
*  Well, that's probably a good thing, right? [[03:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11382.699999999999s)]
*  I think it's a good thing. [[03:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11384.58s)]
*  The reevaluation process is always good [[03:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11385.779999999999s)]
*  because there's gonna be a bunch of people [[03:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11388.859999999999s)]
*  that just course correct. [[03:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11390.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it's, listen, [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11391.859999999999s)]
*  the three of us, we get to do things [[03:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11394.22s)]
*  that we really love, right? [[03:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11396.38s)]
*  We really, we're passionate, [[03:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11398.38s)]
*  we feel like it makes a difference, [[03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11399.66s)]
*  like we eat, sleep, drink it. [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11401.02s)]
*  And that's rare, that's really rare. [[03:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11403.880000000001s)]
*  Most people are, they're like punching the clock, [[03:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11406.640000000001s)]
*  they're doing their thing to be able to get a check, [[03:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11409.960000000001s)]
*  to be able to support their family. [[03:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11411.84s)]
*  And so, there's been this sort of like, [[03:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11412.84s)]
*  I don't know, ideology sold around careerism [[03:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11416.36s)]
*  to especially like college educated, [[03:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11420.44s)]
*  white collar workers that like, [[03:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11422.28s)]
*  this is the thing that's supposed to be [[03:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11423.68s)]
*  who you are in your whole life. [[03:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11425.16s)]
*  And I think taking a step back from that [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11427.480000000001s)]
*  and being more intentional about like, [[03:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11429.04s)]
*  well, is that actually what I want my whole life [[03:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11430.68s)]
*  to be about? [[03:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11432.640000000001s)]
*  I mean, there are other things [[03:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11433.859999999999s)]
*  that are outside of the workplace [[03:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11434.9s)]
*  that are more meaningful to me, [[03:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11436.66s)]
*  that provide me more happiness or more joy [[03:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11438.02s)]
*  or more fulfillment in my life. [[03:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11440.8s)]
*  I 100% think that that's a positive thing. [[03:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11442.24s)]
*  That's our bright note, which should end on that. [[03:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11444.14s)]
*  All right, let's do it. [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11445.74s)]
*  I like it. [[03:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11446.58s)]
*  That's a positive. I found it. [[03:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11447.619999999999s)]
*  I think it's great. [[03:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11449.34s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a positive direction. [[03:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8m6Wrlqho&t=11450.18s)]
