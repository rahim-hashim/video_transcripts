# Joe Rogan Experience #2320 - Tom Segura
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6.0s)]
*  What's wrong with you? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=14.0s)]
*  How? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=16.0s)]
*  First of all, how did Netflix let you make this show? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=18.0s)]
*  Well, they wouldn't have let me make it if I just pitched it to them. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=21.0s)]
*  What did you do? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=27.0s)]
*  I made a few and showed it to them. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=29.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=31.0s)]
*  I knew that if... [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=33.0s)]
*  You can't give anybody the script. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=35.0s)]
*  No. The script won't work. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=37.0s)]
*  The script won't work. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=39.0s)]
*  I mean that's just... [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=41.0s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=43.0s)]
*  It's very funny. Very funny. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=45.0s)]
*  Thanks man. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=47.0s)]
*  It's pretty ridiculous. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=49.0s)]
*  You know, it was a few years ago that I made the initial one. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=51.0s)]
*  I was on that crazy tour. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=55.0s)]
*  The real crazy tour where it was like, you know, fucking 10 shows a week. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=57.0s)]
*  And I had a break coming up. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=61.0s)]
*  And so I've always liked movies. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=63.0s)]
*  Like features, right? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=66.0s)]
*  But it's a huge undertaking to get a feature made. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=68.0s)]
*  But I liked short films because it feels like you're making a movie. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=71.0s)]
*  You know, like a mini movie, right? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=74.0s)]
*  And it feels much more accessible to do. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=76.0s)]
*  So I had written all these like short stories, short films. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=79.0s)]
*  And I called my friend Rami Hashash and I was like, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=83.0s)]
*  Hey, I have a break coming up on tour. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=86.0s)]
*  Let's shoot a short film. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=88.0s)]
*  Because we'd done other things before. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=89.0s)]
*  And when I sent him, I sent him like 10 different scripts. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=91.0s)]
*  He was like, what if we did three of these? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=95.0s)]
*  I was like, how can we do three of them? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=97.0s)]
*  He's like, we'll shoot like 11 days in a row. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=99.0s)]
*  We can do three of these stories. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=101.0s)]
*  And even then I wasn't thinking of like having a television series. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=104.0s)]
*  I was just like, oh, it'll be fun to make these stories, you know? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=108.0s)]
*  And so after we shot those three, it was clear that we had like, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=113.0s)]
*  like the, you know, the bones of a show. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=118.0s)]
*  Like what if we, what if we did a show that was based on short stories, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=120.0s)]
*  you know, like short films basically. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=125.0s)]
*  And I don't know, I, there's, well, there was another, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=127.0s)]
*  there's another few that were in the original. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=130.0s)]
*  And when I sent them in to Netflix, they're like, this is fucking insane. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=133.0s)]
*  But like, we'll make six episodes of this. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=137.0s)]
*  And yeah, they were just like, this is crazy. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=142.0s)]
*  But it's been the most fun I've ever had, dude. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=145.0s)]
*  Really? Yeah, yeah. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=148.0s)]
*  Because you know what, I was thinking about it like on my way in here today. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=149.0s)]
*  I was like, sometimes you have to remind yourself like of what your, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=152.0s)]
*  like your dream, like your original dream, you know? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=157.0s)]
*  And my dream when I moved to LA had nothing to do with stand-up. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=160.0s)]
*  I never thought of stand-up. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=165.0s)]
*  Not to say that I don't love doing stand-up today. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=166.0s)]
*  I'm in love with stand-up. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=170.0s)]
*  But I moved to LA because I was like, oh, I want to do movies. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=172.0s)]
*  Like that was my whole thing. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=177.0s)]
*  I want to do comedy movies. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=179.0s)]
*  And I had like my own blueprint for how I would do it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=180.0s)]
*  I was like, I'll go to the Groundlings. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=183.0s)]
*  SNL will definitely hire me from there. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=186.0s)]
*  Like this is like my 21-year-old brain. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=189.0s)]
*  And then I'll do that for a couple of years and then I'll do movies. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=191.0s)]
*  Like I thought that was a logical game plan to end up in movies. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=194.0s)]
*  And it just, you know, I did do the Groundlings for a while, the school. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=199.0s)]
*  But when I was supposed to do writing lab, which was like one of their levels, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=203.0s)]
*  I had started stand-up and I was just like, oh, this path is just better for me. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=207.0s)]
*  Like I was getting traction, not like my career wasn't moving, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=212.0s)]
*  but I'm saying like I could feel how much I loved it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=216.0s)]
*  And I was starting to get like 50 bucks here and there. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=220.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, it's not doing the writing lab thing. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=222.0s)]
*  It's staying in the stand-up path. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=224.0s)]
*  You know, that's kind of like interesting. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=226.0s)]
*  But the dream of like of doing something like movies, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=227.0s)]
*  which is like this feels like to me like they sent me to film school [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=232.0s)]
*  and they were like, make your fucked up movies. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=235.0s)]
*  That's what it felt like. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=237.0s)]
*  That's been like I was, you know, I was working like 16 hour days doing this thing. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=239.0s)]
*  And I would come home and Christina would be like, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=245.0s)]
*  I have never seen you so energized after working all goddamn day. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=247.0s)]
*  She's like, you come home in the best mood. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=251.0s)]
*  I was like, yeah, because I'm having fun. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=253.0s)]
*  Like I'm having so much fun doing this, you know, all that shows you're doing the right thing. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=255.0s)]
*  I think so. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=259.0s)]
*  I mean, it was like that is so uniquely you. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=260.0s)]
*  It is right. Oh, yeah. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=263.0s)]
*  Yeah. That's our fucking text thread. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=264.0s)]
*  Pretty much is. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=266.0s)]
*  There are some in here that I can't wait for you to see. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=268.0s)]
*  Like there are some in here that I literally cannot wait for you. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=270.0s)]
*  She this morning, she goes, why is it called bad thoughts? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=274.0s)]
*  It should be called cock thoughts. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=277.0s)]
*  She's like, she's like, I swear, there's dicks in like every other one. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=280.0s)]
*  Yeah. She's like dicks and violence. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=283.0s)]
*  That's your your wheelhouse. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=286.0s)]
*  We need more of this in the world. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=288.0s)]
*  Yeah, we really do. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=291.0s)]
*  But you know that that show, the the religious show on Max, like I'm not remembering it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=294.0s)]
*  Righteous gemstones. Oh, yeah. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=302.0s)]
*  Fucking a yeah, man. Dude, Dan McBride. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=304.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's fucking fantastic. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=307.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's fantastic. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=309.0s)]
*  But the whole cast, the whole cast is. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=310.0s)]
*  The fucking show is so good. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=312.0s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=314.0s)]
*  Goggins, Adam Devine, John Goodman. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=315.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Everyone's amazing. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=318.0s)]
*  They're all fantastic. But it's also so ridiculous. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=320.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's like, thank God. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=322.0s)]
*  It seems like for a while people were getting scared of making anything offensive. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=324.0s)]
*  I know. And it also feels like so many studios, networks, platforms, whatever you want to call it, are like so distanced from comedy. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=329.0s)]
*  Like, it's like comedy is too dangerous. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=339.0s)]
*  It's very like. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=341.0s)]
*  Well, it's weird as you can get away with so much in a drama and a drama. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=343.0s)]
*  You could have violence and theft and car accidents. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=348.0s)]
*  You fucking kill people and rape people and steal all their money. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=353.0s)]
*  And and that's OK. Yeah. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=356.0s)]
*  For some reason. But like there's something about doing comedy that's offensive or even potentially offensive. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=358.0s)]
*  Yeah. The other thing is there's the offensive angle. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=365.0s)]
*  I also think that they really shit the bed on literally backing truly funny material like the comp. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=368.0s)]
*  So many studio comedies that are released, the the critics, people like, why didn't this work? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=378.0s)]
*  Because it's not good. It wasn't funny. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=384.0s)]
*  It's not a funny comedy. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=386.0s)]
*  But you don't think part of that is because they can't take any real chance? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=387.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think a studio is always, you know, like if you strip everything down, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=390.0s)]
*  it's somebody that has to have some risk in their job. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=396.0s)]
*  They're playing with millions of dollars and saying like this, this will make us money. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=400.0s)]
*  Right. And so, yeah, they start to get more apprehensive about it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=405.0s)]
*  The other thing is that the cost of some of these comedies when comedies were really thriving last, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=409.0s)]
*  which was I think like more than 20 years ago, some of these comedies started to cost like 30 million plus to do a comedy. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=417.0s)]
*  Yeah, because sometimes you had like huge stars and huge set pieces and you'd have these enormous budgets. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=423.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like real. And now some of them like Tropic Thunder, I think, did probably pretty well. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=429.0s)]
*  But a lot of them would not. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=434.0s)]
*  And so it started to be like, hey, you know what, we can make this. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=438.0s)]
*  They started. That's why you see the explosion of certain genres. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=441.0s)]
*  Right. Like horror really has had a huge uptick the last decade plus because people can produce them for five million. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=444.0s)]
*  But they don't realize that you can produce great comedies for five million also. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=451.0s)]
*  You can. But you have to like prioritize the material first. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=456.0s)]
*  It's got to be a great script and they got to be willing to back it. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=461.0s)]
*  You know, I feel like they just haven't taken those those shots yet. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=464.0s)]
*  What's kind of a tremendous opportunity, right? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=467.0s)]
*  Because of the fact that these big studios and these big stars are not doing those kind of films. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=469.0s)]
*  Exactly. Like the door is wide open. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=476.0s)]
*  The door is wide open because the demand has never gone away. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=478.0s)]
*  No, people want it. They want to laugh. Always. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=481.0s)]
*  I'm doing one this summer. Yeah, I'm doing a movie this summer. Yeah. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=484.0s)]
*  What are you doing? It's a crazy fucking comedy. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=487.0s)]
*  It's insane. It hasn't been announced yet. So you know how they are about that. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=489.0s)]
*  But it's a it's a wild R rated comedy. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=493.0s)]
*  Well, tell me about it afterwards. OK. Yeah. Hi, everybody else. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=495.0s)]
*  Yeah, I would love to talk about it. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=498.0s)]
*  But but I think we're we're doing kind of like what you're saying, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=500.0s)]
*  which is like we're going to go all in on trying to make this really funny movie. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=504.0s)]
*  And I mean, I couldn't be more excited about it. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=509.0s)]
*  And I think it's it's like it takes you realize when you're you know, you read it and you go, this is it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=511.0s)]
*  We kind of do, you know, some punch ups on the script. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=516.0s)]
*  And then you just try to surround yourself with amazing comedic talent, you know, like great actors and just have fun. Yeah. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=520.0s)]
*  I think that's like that's awesome. Something that's missing. That's so cool. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=526.0s)]
*  I didn't even know that that was your original dream. I fucking known you forever. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=530.0s)]
*  I know. Yeah, it was I guess I was probably like I kind of was resigned to that's not going to happen to you know, not like I mean, the other thing is like, dude, every time I'm out on the road, you know, I would get a call. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=533.0s)]
*  Hey, they want to see you for this part or you got an offer to shoot this show or this like here's the offer. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=546.0s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, I'm I'm on tour. Like, I can't move the fucking United Center. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=555.0s)]
*  You know, they don't care. They don't care. They just want that piece. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=561.0s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, I think they don't get a piece that you know, I know, like I can't move all that shit. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=564.0s)]
*  But that's also I realize that after years of that, it's like, well, if I'm always touring, I'm just never going to be able to do other people's stuff. Yeah. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=568.0s)]
*  And so it also kind of I got excited about, you know, having the summer off and I could do something. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=577.0s)]
*  And then my tour, the current tour I'm on will end in December and I'm leaving 26 wide open. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=583.0s)]
*  Really? Yeah. I mean, film stuff. I'm going to film some stuff and then I'll still do like what I do, which is like go into your club or book some club weekends, which are kind of like low, you know, stress kind of things where you go. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=589.0s)]
*  I'm just going to go work out. So I'll try to keep the muscle fresh, but I won't book like a tour. Yeah. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=604.0s)]
*  It's good to take breaks. It is right. I took a big sort of a break. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=612.0s)]
*  I've just been doing a club. How's that? Since I did my live special. Yeah. It's very nice. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=616.0s)]
*  It's not. It's great having no pressure. So like I just talk about what I want to talk about and I write about what I want to write about instead of going, I got to put an hour together. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=622.0s)]
*  Yes, I have a tour in three months. Right. Like I have to make sure this hour's tight. I have to. You just kind of take your time with it. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=633.0s)]
*  And I think there's there's something to be said for taking breaks with stand up in particular because like you don't want to just have tools that you use to do a job. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=638.0s)]
*  Right. You want to actually like you have to kind of figure out what am I investing all my time in these subject matters? Yeah. What am I? What am I? What is like? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=651.0s)]
*  What is like? What's interesting to me? How much time is that going to take to figure out what the perspective is? Work? Just say it on stage. Yeah, because I feel like with a lot of comics, there's a thing happens. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=660.0s)]
*  Where you get kind of like locked into a set and then you abandon that set and there's this mad scramble to come up with a new set. Yes. And a lot of times when you're doing that new set, it's not you're not invested in it. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=673.0s)]
*  It just you know, you can make it effective. Right. You know what I mean? It kind of feels like filler. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know exactly what you mean. And the audience feels that too. I think they definitely do. They do. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=689.0s)]
*  Because I feel it as an audience member. I know when someone's doing that and I go, this is not I'm not connecting with this at all. Right. But if it's something that you can tell the person wants to talk about, it resonates. It's different. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=700.0s)]
*  Actually interesting. That's the thing. It's like, you know, as I've gotten older, I've thought thoughts much more about stand up. And I there's a lot of stand up is kind of like unspoken. I think a lot of it is hypnosis. Really? Yeah, there's a weird thing going on. And I get I get it from great, great comedians. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=712.0s)]
*  Like, when I was a kid, there was this guy named Frank Santos, the R rated hypnotist, and he would go on stage and make people do stuff. And like, you're having sex with Madonna was really weird. Yeah, there was a flow to the way his confidence or something about him. And he was also an actual hitman, like, you know, hypnotize people to quit smoking and shit like that. Yeah. And there was something that he was doing, where I was like, what is he doing? Like, how's he like, what is this connection where it's just so funny? I mean, I think it's so funny. I think it's so funny. I think it's so funny. I think it's so funny. I think it's so funny. I think it's so funny. I think it's so funny. I think it's so funny. I think it's so funny. I think it's so funny. I think it's so funny. I think it's so funny. I think it's so funny. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=734.0s)]
*  Like, how is he getting into these people's heads? Like, what is hypnosis? And then I see like a guy like a tell on stage when he's killing. And I recognize something in I'm like, he's hypnotizing us. There's something that he's doing this effortless, effortless confidence and connection to what he's talking about. And great material also. So you give him the reins. You're like, oh, this material so good. I'll give you the reins. Take my brain. Take my brain. Take my brain. And the rhythm of the cadence to [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=764.0s)]
*  go to him. And you realize like, you know, like to start thinking about like, his stage name, his love, his [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=794.0s)]
*  success. Because he has a very particular cadence. And you, you know, if you hang out with him, or work with him, like I did a few times you start doing a lot of people start doing the cadence. And I did [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=796.24s)]
*  that, I did that in like, oh, 5 or 6. When I was like, he was on his show and his out his first like Killer album came out, Skanks For the Memories. Yeah, I mean, I feel like I would be talking to you like this. I get outside, like, how's [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=810.36s)]
*  like a hypnotic type of cadence. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=823.4s)]
*  Yeah, but Trisha always says that about like having babies. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=826.04s)]
*  Like that's his babies. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=828.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=830.12s)]
*  Like David Tell has a bunch of babies. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=830.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=832.16s)]
*  That's like bunch of people that gave, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=833.0s)]
*  he gave birth to their. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=834.48s)]
*  100%. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=835.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=836.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's super normal. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=837.9599999999999s)]
*  A lot of people have that. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=840.24s)]
*  But it's interesting how that stuff works. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=841.4399999999999s)]
*  That there's a thing that's going on, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=843.84s)]
*  which is why live standup is so much better [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=847.3199999999999s)]
*  than standup on television. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=851.24s)]
*  I also have this thing recently, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=852.8399999999999s)]
*  cause I'm on tour right now. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=854.12s)]
*  I realized that like, man, it's funny how I could be, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=855.5999999999999s)]
*  I could be like tired and being tired, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=861.8399999999999s)]
*  I go on stage in a different mindset. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=867.52s)]
*  And all of a sudden I'm like, wow, that was a way better set. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=870.4399999999999s)]
*  Like I had the right amount of tired, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=872.68s)]
*  not tired where I can't think. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=874.92s)]
*  But more relaxed. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=876.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=877.8399999999999s)]
*  And then I get off and like my whole tour crew was like, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=878.68s)]
*  that was fucking amazing show. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=881.36s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, I feel like I was too tired [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=883.44s)]
*  to be like self-conscious or something. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=886.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=888.6400000000001s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=889.48s)]
*  Like some of my self-awareness went away, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=890.32s)]
*  but like the right degree of it went away. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=892.7600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=895.32s)]
*  And then the show just felt better. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=896.1600000000001s)]
*  And then you locked in with them. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=897.6400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I also like to tell myself sometimes if I remember, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=898.8000000000001s)]
*  that I'm best on stage if I'm going on stage [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=902.96s)]
*  in a silly mindset. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=907.36s)]
*  If I'm goofing off backstage. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=909.08s)]
*  Fucking around. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=911.96s)]
*  Making fun of somebody that's like in my crew or something. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=914.28s)]
*  I don't know, like dancing in the green room, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=916.88s)]
*  like just silly. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=920.12s)]
*  That mindset walking up on stage [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=921.4s)]
*  is like the best one to go on stage with. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=924.48s)]
*  That's why you still love working with Joey so much. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=926.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=929.4s)]
*  Because two things, one, Joey would make me laugh [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=930.24s)]
*  like while he was on stage. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=933.0s)]
*  I'd be waiting to go on stage. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=934.48s)]
*  Instead of thinking about my material [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=935.88s)]
*  and going over everything with a fine tooth comb, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=937.76s)]
*  I'd just be laughing. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=939.6s)]
*  And then I'd go on stage laughing. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=941.9599999999999s)]
*  And that's the thing is that's an unspoken thing [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=943.8s)]
*  that the audience goes like, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=946.4s)]
*  there's joy coming from this person. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=947.9599999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=949.64s)]
*  You know, they feel the joy. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=950.48s)]
*  Yeah, legit. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=951.3199999999999s)]
*  They really do. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=952.16s)]
*  Because like there's nothing grosser than fake laughs. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=953.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=956.0s)]
*  When a comedian does the fake laugh thing, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=956.8399999999999s)]
*  it's fucking gross. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=958.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=960.12s)]
*  It's just like when you know they've said [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=960.9599999999999s)]
*  that fucking same joke the same way, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=962.28s)]
*  every night with the same laugh. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=964.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=967.0s)]
*  Like, ugh, you're tricking me. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=967.8399999999999s)]
*  You're tricking me, yeah. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=969.36s)]
*  It's so manufactured, you know? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=970.32s)]
*  It's so calculated. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=973.44s)]
*  Which is fine. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=975.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, whatever, do whatever you want. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=976.4000000000001s)]
*  But it's like there's a thing that comes with that [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=978.48s)]
*  that's like, okay, I'm never gonna be fully locked in, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=982.1600000000001s)]
*  but maybe I can just appreciate this for, you know? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=985.88s)]
*  True. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=988.08s)]
*  Like I'm watching a sitcom. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=988.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=989.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=990.6s)]
*  And then there's also nothing as fun as genuine laughter on, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=991.4200000000001s)]
*  like if something really makes you laugh [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=996.54s)]
*  while you're doing a set, that's the most fun. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1000.42s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1003.3399999999999s)]
*  And that becomes contagious. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1004.18s)]
*  It's like that's why the bits work so good [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1005.5799999999999s)]
*  when you first start doing them. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1008.2199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1009.5799999999999s)]
*  And then sometimes they die off [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1010.42s)]
*  because you're getting tired of it [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1011.26s)]
*  and you're not laughing anymore. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1012.0999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1013.06s)]
*  Whereas like there's certain things, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1014.26s)]
*  like at a subject when you first start talking about it, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1015.9399999999999s)]
*  you're like, what the fuck is going on? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1018.42s)]
*  How is this a real thing? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1021.5799999999999s)]
*  It's so funny because we were just talking about [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1022.78s)]
*  how there's certain bits where it kills, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1024.9s)]
*  like it kills, right? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1031.26s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1032.5s)]
*  And then over the next few months. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1033.3400000000001s)]
*  It dies. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1035.66s)]
*  It dies slowly. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1036.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1037.5800000000002s)]
*  And you're trying to do the math. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1038.42s)]
*  You're like, wait, am I saying it different? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1039.42s)]
*  Am I, like, you go listen? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1041.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1043.7s)]
*  Did I miss a beat or something? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1044.5400000000002s)]
*  Did I miss some connective tissue? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1045.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1047.1000000000001s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1047.94s)]
*  And it's just like, by the end you're like, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1048.7800000000002s)]
*  no, it's fully dead. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1049.6000000000001s)]
*  It has died. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1050.44s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1051.42s)]
*  You just gotta be able to accept that they're dead. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1052.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1054.1s)]
*  That's such a funny thing though that happens. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1054.9399999999998s)]
*  I have a bunch of bits I call orphans. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1057.3799999999999s)]
*  We have a file of orphans. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1059.4199999999998s)]
*  Oh, like they're just. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1061.1999999999998s)]
*  They're all bits that just never made it onto a special. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1062.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1063.6999999999998s)]
*  Like someone comes up to me, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1064.54s)]
*  like every now and then one of my friends come up to me, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1065.3799999999999s)]
*  like, do you do that fucking, is that on anything? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1067.1399999999999s)]
*  I was like, that one's just an orphan. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1069.5s)]
*  It's an orphan, yeah. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1071.06s)]
*  It's just floating around. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1071.8999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't fit with anything. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1072.74s)]
*  And it's all so fucked up. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1073.78s)]
*  And sometimes you're like, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1075.3s)]
*  you ever try to bring those back? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1076.58s)]
*  I brought some back that didn't make it. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1078.26s)]
*  And sometimes they get new life. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1080.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1083.06s)]

*  I'll pull something out. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1093.64s)]
*  And I'm like, actually. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1094.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1096.02s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1098.66s)]
*  If I can kind of remember it. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1099.5s)]
*  That's the other thing is your memory starts to, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1100.5s)]

*  And I go, I honestly don't remember how it goes. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1112.42s)]
*  Like I'll start it and then I'll forget. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1114.5800000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1116.66s)]

*  I don't remember. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1121.68s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes that's good. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1122.5s)]
*  That'd be funny if they did it. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1123.3400000000001s)]
*  They acted it out. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1124.18s)]
*  It's pretty fun. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1125.2600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, because there's certain bits. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1126.1000000000001s)]
*  Like they just leave your mind. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1127.2600000000002s)]
*  It's like, I'm done with this. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1128.98s)]
*  But did you like any of the acting stuff? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1130.5400000000002s)]
*  Cause I know you don't have any interest [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1133.7s)]
*  in doing it anymore, but did you enjoy it? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1135.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1136.94s)]

*  That was fun. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1139.3000000000002s)]
*  It was fun. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1140.14s)]
*  I didn't mind doing it. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1141.1s)]
*  It's just, I didn't like it as much. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1142.58s)]
*  And I didn't like the time commitment that these, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1144.58s)]
*  I mean, I don't sound like I'm complaining. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1148.78s)]
*  Oh, it's acting so hard. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1150.28s)]
*  But it's like you're working these long ass days. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1152.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1155.02s)]
*  And as a person who likes to do a lot of different things, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1155.8600000000001s)]
*  that becomes a problem. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1158.42s)]
*  And you were on a multicam. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1159.6200000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1161.1s)]
*  Imagine if you were on a single cam. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1161.94s)]

*  then you go up again. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1637.8600000000001s)]
*  Oh, a lot of incline. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1638.82s)]

*  He's used to holding drinks. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1750.5s)]
*  I couldn't do it, I tapped out. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1751.78s)]

*  He beat everybody. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1774.7s)]
*  He should hold out and just humiliate them [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1775.74s)]
*  after he's done, just keep going. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1777.66s)]

*  He's got incredible genetics. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1792.02s)]
*  Like if he wanted to be an athlete, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1794.66s)]
*  he'd be an incredible athlete. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1796.26s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1797.38s)]
*  If he was like super dedicated to it, yeah. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1798.22s)]
*  Yeah, he's just trapped in booze. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1799.98s)]

*  I mean, I want him to be healthy. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1810.98s)]
*  But when we first started doing Sober October, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1811.98s)]
*  it was essentially just because we were worried [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1814.74s)]
*  Burt was gonna die. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=1816.34s)]

*  up and holding, like gymnasts. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2221.06s)]
*  Who's more jack than the guys who do the rings? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2222.82s)]
*  No. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2224.9s)]
*  They're super jack. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2225.7400000000002s)]
*  Look at his forearms. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2226.58s)]

*  There's a split in the muscle. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2236.86s)]
*  That's a calf. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2238.66s)]
*  Yeah, that's a calf. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2239.5s)]
*  That's like a strong calf. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2240.82s)]
*  And this is like a big endorsement [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2243.1800000000003s)]
*  for calisthenics basically, right? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2244.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, isn't it? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2246.3s)]
*  Calisthenics are huge. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2247.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2247.98s)]

*  Really? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2250.5s)]
*  Oh yeah, I do a lot of calisthenics. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2251.34s)]
*  I do, I still do the 100 pushups every day [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2253.42s)]
*  and the 100 body weight squats, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2256.1400000000003s)]
*  but I do chin ups, dips and L L pull ups, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2257.98s)]
*  you know, like, so you're like with a close grip [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2262.1400000000003s)]
*  but the legs extended. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2264.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2265.7000000000003s)]
*  I do all those. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2266.54s)]
*  Really? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2267.38s)]
*  They're huge. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2268.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's, you want to be able to, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2269.04s)]
*  I do hang from a bar like this [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2270.6400000000003s)]
*  where I swing my toes up and I touch the bar. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2273.6800000000003s)]
*  So it's like really works the core too. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2276.2000000000003s)]
*  That's like being able to manipulate [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2278.8s)]
*  your own body weight is crucial. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2280.88s)]
*  Yeah, because those gymnasts are like, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2282.8s)]
*  some of them like, I've never touched weights. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2285.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm just doing this shit all day. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2287.0s)]
*  Which is nuts. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2287.96s)]
*  And they have the craziest. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2288.8s)]
*  But it's not time efficient. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2290.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2292.0s)]
*  Because they're doing that. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2292.84s)]
*  Hours. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2293.8s)]
*  Their muscles are like that [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2294.6400000000003s)]
*  because they're doing eight hour sessions. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2295.48s)]
*  But you can get a lot done with your body [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2297.2s)]
*  with just dips and chin ups. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2300.2s)]
*  A lot. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2302.0s)]
*  Dips are incredible. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2302.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2303.66s)]
*  So good. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2304.5s)]
*  I mean, that was like, I think when Arnold [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2305.3199999999997s)]
*  would talk about chest, he was like, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2308.16s)]
*  that was like the, you know, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2309.8399999999997s)]
*  the cherry on top for the workouts was doing. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2312.56s)]
*  He's like, we always would do dips. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2314.3999999999996s)]
*  And you could do weighted dips too. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2316.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2318.96s)]
*  Dips are so easy to do with weight [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2319.7999999999997s)]
*  or throw a chain over your neck [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2321.12s)]
*  or put a weight vest on or something like that. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2323.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2325.3599999999997s)]
*  That's another thing I found. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2326.2s)]
*  It's just a 25 pound weight vest [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2327.86s)]
*  where it doesn't feel like anything [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2328.7s)]
*  when you're wearing it. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2329.54s)]
*  But when you do stuff with it on, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2330.58s)]
*  like chin ups and pull ups, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2332.14s)]
*  like holy fuck. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2333.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2334.34s)]
*  It's giant difference. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2335.18s)]
*  So different. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2336.02s)]
*  And then when you take that thing off, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2336.84s)]
*  you're like, oh man. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2337.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2338.5s)]
*  So imagine being 25 pounds too heavy. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2339.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2341.9s)]
*  And then imagine being jelly roll. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2342.74s)]
*  So jelly roll is walking around [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2343.88s)]
*  200 pounds too heavy before. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2345.54s)]
*  At least. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2348.66s)]
*  So it's actually 300 pounds, right? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2349.5s)]
*  Because he wants to lose another hundred. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2351.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2352.1s)]
*  So imagine just carrying around [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2352.94s)]
*  everywhere you go. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2355.1s)]
*  You've got a squat rack, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2356.1s)]
*  like a real bar stuffed with plates [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2357.9s)]
*  and you're just carrying that through life. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2362.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2364.7000000000003s)]
*  That's what they're doing. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2365.54s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2366.36s)]
*  That's why those guys' fucking lower bodies [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2367.2000000000003s)]
*  are always crazy when they lose weight. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2368.06s)]
*  Oh, Ralphie May used to have [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2369.78s)]
*  the biggest calves in the world. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2370.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2372.26s)]
*  His legs were like carrying that. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2373.1s)]
*  Tree trunks. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2374.42s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2375.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2376.1s)]
*  Just carrying around that body all day. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2376.92s)]
*  That's nuts. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2378.2200000000003s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2379.44s)]
*  And if they trim down enough, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2380.28s)]
*  the quads are still humongous. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2381.46s)]
*  Yeah, Burt lost weight. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2383.58s)]
*  He would get weaker. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2384.42s)]
*  But you do get weaker when you lose weight. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2386.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2388.42s)]
*  I mean, that's a fact. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2389.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's always a mass moves mass. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2390.1s)]
*  It's also like to lose weight, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2391.98s)]
*  to lose body fat, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2393.94s)]
*  your body has to think something's wrong. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2395.1s)]
*  Like it's very difficult to maintain mass, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2397.7000000000003s)]
*  like maintain muscle mass while you're losing fat. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2401.92s)]
*  It's hard. Yeah, that's hard. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2404.62s)]
*  You gotta be real careful with everything. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2405.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2407.46s)]
*  And you gotta try not to lose too much weight too quick. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2408.66s)]
*  Because a lot of people with losing weight, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2411.52s)]
*  a lot of people become food addicts [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2414.3799999999997s)]
*  and then addicts act like addicts. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2416.02s)]
*  And you start thinking, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2417.9399999999996s)]
*  I gotta lose it all right now. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2418.7799999999997s)]

*  Tour, it's hard, right? [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2481.82s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2482.6600000000003s)]
*  You're like, I'm working, fuck it, cheeseburger. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2483.5s)]

*  Let's eat. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2486.06s)]
*  Let's eat pizza. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2486.9s)]
*  Sometimes it's that. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2487.7400000000002s)]
*  Sometimes it's also just that like, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2488.56s)]
*  you know, I get into this rhythm of the way I'm eating [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2490.1800000000003s)]
*  and training at home, which is pretty good. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2493.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2495.7000000000003s)]
*  And then you get out there and it's like, fuck. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2496.54s)]
*  You know, we got on three planes and you're just tired. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2497.78s)]
*  You just don't do it. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2500.1400000000003s)]
*  And then, yeah, you just order whatever to eat. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2501.7400000000002s)]
*  So you just feel it like slowly come apart. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2503.5s)]
*  But I feel like I'm also at a place where I know [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2505.82s)]
*  if I dial in my diet and make sure I stay on top [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2508.98s)]
*  of like the training, I can shed this 10 pretty. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2515.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, you've done it before. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2519.0600000000004s)]
*  You did it pretty well, you know? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2520.42s)]
*  You figured it out. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2522.7400000000002s)]
*  And then you also have muscle memory now. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2524.38s)]
*  I think it's hard when you're traveling [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2526.54s)]
*  because you know, anytime you're traveling, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2529.78s)]
*  your energy level goes down. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2532.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2534.7400000000002s)]
*  It's like you gotta figure out things to mitigate [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2535.5800000000004s)]
*  that energy level going down. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2537.02s)]
*  And then counterintuitively, the best way to do that [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2538.34s)]
*  is to work out. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2540.98s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2541.94s)]
*  Which doesn't seem like it makes any sense [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2542.78s)]
*  because you're tired. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2544.5800000000004s)]
*  I don't wanna work out. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2545.42s)]
*  A lot of times we do the land and lift. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2546.2400000000002s)]
*  Gotta do that. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2548.26s)]
*  Like right, land and go. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2549.1000000000004s)]
*  Yep, land and go, land and go. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2550.42s)]
*  It is crazy how, I do a lot of three day, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2551.94s)]
*  three, four day weekends, you know, for tour. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2555.0600000000004s)]
*  Man, a lot of times on that third, fourth day, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2557.82s)]
*  you're in your third or fourth city [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2560.26s)]
*  and you're like, fuck, I am wrecked today. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2562.02s)]
*  Just like another plane, another time zone. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2564.94s)]
*  You take a lot of vitamins? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2566.9s)]
*  I take a pretty good amount of vitamins, yeah. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2569.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2572.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's important too. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2572.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2574.2200000000003s)]
*  Take a lot of vitamins. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2575.0600000000004s)]
*  And then it's hard to be strict with your diet [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2575.88s)]
*  when you're on the road. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2578.9s)]
*  But the big one is alcohol. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2580.5s)]
*  I'm lucky in that regard [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2583.7000000000003s)]
*  because I'm not a big boozer. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2584.9s)]
*  I don't know how Burt does it. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2586.58s)]
*  I started eating these David bars. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2588.06s)]

*  if you get hungry, keep you from eating bullshit. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2609.46s)]
*  From eating bullshit. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2611.66s)]
*  That's all I'm trying, like sometimes I go like, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2612.5s)]
*  oh, it was great. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2614.5s)]
*  Today was a great day. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2615.34s)]
*  And then it's just dinner. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2617.26s)]
*  So you just like, just don't fucking ruin your day. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2618.3s)]
*  Have you ever had carnivore snacks? [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2620.86s)]
*  Do you know what that is? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2622.94s)]
*  No. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2624.34s)]
*  The carnivore snacks, ribeye is my go-to. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2625.34s)]
*  I bring that on the UFC broadcast. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2628.38s)]
*  Like I give them to Daniel Cormier and me, we eat them. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2630.92s)]
*  It's like sliced ribeyes that are just dried. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2633.3s)]
*  But it's got the fat on it. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2636.86s)]
*  It's good. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2638.54s)]
*  Yeah, you don't feel guilty at all. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2639.38s)]
*  Like if you're hungry and need a snack, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2640.58s)]
*  it's just meat and salt. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2642.62s)]
*  Perfect, perfect snack. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2644.5s)]

*  Snacks with an X. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2648.98s)]
*  But it's not like, it's not jerky. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2650.54s)]
*  It's like, they describe it as like meat pastry. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2653.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2656.58s)]
*  It's good snack food. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2657.4199999999996s)]

*  Yeah, just to keep from going off the rails. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2660.14s)]
*  That's all you're trying to do. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2662.1s)]
*  That's all I'm trying to do is just mitigate [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2662.9399999999996s)]
*  the damage of the day. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2664.7799999999997s)]
*  I have a whole folder on my phone saved up of food [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2666.62s)]
*  that I really can't eat. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2669.22s)]
*  Really? [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2670.5s)]
*  Look at restaurants like, oh. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2671.58s)]
*  What do you miss the most when you are trying to eat healthy? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2674.58s)]
*  Italian food, Italian food. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2677.06s)]
*  Pasta, right? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2678.58s)]
*  Pasta and crazy sandwiches. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2679.42s)]
*  Oh my God, we went to Carbone. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2681.42s)]
*  Oh, in New York? [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2683.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, they got one in Vegas now too. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2684.82s)]
*  I know. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2686.46s)]
*  I think they've actually had the Vegas one for a while. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2687.78s)]
*  It's so good, dude. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2689.86s)]
*  So good, that rigatoni with vodka sauce. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2691.82s)]
*  When it has a little kick, they put a little spice in it. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2696.02s)]
*  It's good, it's so good. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2697.98s)]
*  It's tough to beat Italian food. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2700.78s)]
*  It really is. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2703.0600000000004s)]
*  It's tough to beat it just for pure, ugh. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2704.1000000000004s)]
*  That pleasure of ugh, just over stuffing yourself. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2708.2200000000003s)]
*  We were there for last summer. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2712.1800000000003s)]
*  It was like every day. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2714.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2716.78s)]
*  And the thing is I didn't like blow up. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2717.82s)]
*  No? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2720.7400000000002s)]
*  No, I thought I would. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2721.5800000000004s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure I gained a few, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2722.6600000000003s)]
*  but I thought I was like, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2723.6600000000003s)]
*  oh, this is gonna be fucking terrible. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2724.5s)]
*  But I think a big thing there versus here is portion sizes. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2726.6200000000003s)]
*  There's no such thing as, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2731.74s)]
*  they don't go here's your pasta, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2733.2999999999997s)]
*  here's a fucking bowl like this. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2734.3799999999997s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2736.7s)]
*  Well, I think in Italy, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2738.18s)]
*  the real thing is the food's different. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2739.62s)]
*  I think our food is poison. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2741.8199999999997s)]
*  It's so bad, right? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2743.22s)]
*  I mean, I saw, oh my God, I saw this lady on your show. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2744.3399999999997s)]
*  I saw a clip talking about all these health epidemics, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2748.3399999999997s)]
*  like the full run of stats where she was like, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2752.7799999999997s)]
*  one and two for cancer and this and that. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2756.02s)]
*  Was it Callie Means? [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2758.7799999999997s)]
*  She was, I think she was a doctor, right? [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2761.34s)]
*  Is she a doctor? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2764.38s)]
*  Yeah, well, I don't think she finished her doctorate [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2765.22s)]
*  or her medical school training [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2768.46s)]
*  because I think she got to the position [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2770.62s)]
*  where she realized that most metabolic diseases [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2772.58s)]
*  are being caused by food. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2775.3s)]
*  But that's the thing is like, [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2777.06s)]
*  that's the big takeaway I think from that is like, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2778.14s)]
*  you had this conversation with, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2780.5s)]
*  I had it with people all the time who travel abroad [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2782.42s)]
*  and you're just like, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2785.7s)]
*  everything in Japan was fucking amazing. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2787.1s)]
*  And then you look at their longevity, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2791.26s)]
*  which is like record breaking [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2793.26s)]
*  and when you compare it to most of the world. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2794.98s)]
*  Definitely compare it to ours. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2797.1s)]
*  Definitely compare it to ours. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2798.3s)]
*  Yeah, we have the worst health stats in the Western world. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2799.46s)]
*  It's our food. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2802.98s)]
*  But because it's all like. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2803.82s)]
*  Because corporations, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2805.26s)]
*  because corporations profit off keeping you fat and sick. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2806.6600000000003s)]
*  So the best way to make money from food [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2811.02s)]
*  is to get you addicted to food that they can sell you. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2813.86s)]
*  So they sell you a tremendous amount of cheap shitty food [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2817.46s)]
*  that has a bunch of preservatives and garbage in it. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2821.3s)]
*  So it's potato chips and all sorts of different snacks [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2825.02s)]
*  and all sorts of different things. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2829.38s)]
*  And then you have your enriched air quotes flour [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2831.14s)]
*  that's got a bunch of shit poured into it [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2834.58s)]
*  and it's a bunch of complex glutens in the grains. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2836.62s)]
*  And then you have glyphosate, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2839.5s)]
*  which other countries have banned, but we use everywhere. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2840.94s)]
*  And 90 plus percent of people have glyphosate in their blood [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2844.58s)]
*  when they test it, which is round up [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2848.3s)]
*  that chemical pesticide and herb. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2849.94s)]
*  We have herbicides that kill your fucking endocrine system. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2851.94s)]
*  We have like, we're poisoning ourselves. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2855.3s)]
*  It's really sad. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2857.1s)]
*  We're growing stuff at home now. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2858.2599999999998s)]
*  We have a hydroponic garden. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2860.02s)]
*  Yeah, I talked to Christine about it. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2861.06s)]
*  It's pretty dope. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2862.06s)]
*  And that's just delicious. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2862.9s)]
*  Yeah, that's the way to go. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2864.02s)]
*  The lettuce and the tomatoes [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2865.38s)]
*  and it gets all kinds of like veggies. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2866.86s)]
*  Tastes like real food. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2868.5s)]
*  Yeah, you do taste the difference. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2869.34s)]
*  100%. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2871.3s)]
*  Which reminds me of when you're abroad, right? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2872.62s)]
*  Cause like you, in Italy or in Japan, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2874.98s)]
*  you have a tomato, you have a strawberry [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2878.46s)]
*  and you're like, whoa. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2880.3s)]
*  Yeah, real. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2881.34s)]
*  And you're like, oh, this is what it's supposed to taste like. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2882.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2883.7000000000003s)]
*  We make stuff that can sit on the shelf forever. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2884.9s)]
*  That's why our tomatoes look like they're albino tomatoes. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2888.1s)]
*  They look, and they're hard. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2891.2200000000003s)]
*  Our tomatoes are hard. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2893.26s)]
*  Like, why is a tomato hard? [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2894.6600000000003s)]
*  Like, what is that about? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2896.06s)]
*  Why does it stay hard for like weeks? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2896.9s)]
*  Just sits there. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2899.1400000000003s)]
*  And then we just keep ingesting that. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2900.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's terrible. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2902.98s)]
*  And then you get all this inflammation in your body. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2903.8199999999997s)]
*  And we've sort of genetically modified a bunch of things [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2905.8999999999996s)]
*  so we could feed a bunch of people [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2908.8999999999996s)]
*  so we could have large numbers of people. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2910.2999999999997s)]
*  And there's a benefit to that. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2911.8999999999996s)]
*  How much of this do you think is related to the fact [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2913.06s)]
*  that we have so many more people than some of these places? [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2917.4199999999996s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's a fact. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2920.3399999999997s)]
*  But it's not just that. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2921.2999999999997s)]
*  So I think there's a bunch of factors [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2925.66s)]
*  and everybody wants to be real binary about it. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2927.58s)]
*  Sedentary lifestyle is a big one. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2929.46s)]
*  There's a large percentage of our population [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2931.42s)]
*  that doesn't move enough. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2933.5s)]
*  They don't exercise. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2934.5s)]
*  They don't do anything physical. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2936.54s)]
*  So you got that. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2939.34s)]
*  And then you got years and years and years and years [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2940.54s)]
*  doing that, which eventually catches you. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2942.5s)]
*  And so that's all the people that start showing up [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2945.82s)]
*  at the hospital. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2947.34s)]
*  It's metabolic health, right? [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2948.78s)]
*  So, and then you have lack of understanding of nutrition, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2950.38s)]
*  which is they think, oh, you're some fuckhead doctor [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2954.1800000000003s)]
*  that tells you you just have to eat a balanced diet. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2957.9s)]
*  You don't need vitamins. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2959.98s)]
*  Well, that doctor's fat and stupid [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2961.5s)]
*  and probably has a bunch of diseases [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2963.7s)]
*  and he's on pills himself, like shut up. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2965.14s)]
*  Probably never even went to, through any nutrition training. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2967.54s)]
*  In medical school, they get about six hours [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2971.7400000000002s)]
*  of nutrition training, I think. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2973.98s)]
*  It's crazy that, especially because we have kids in school, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2975.58s)]
*  you realize that schools still, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2979.38s)]
*  they don't emphasize nutrition or finance. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2981.54s)]
*  I feel like that's another crazy thing, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2984.22s)]
*  is to keep people from understanding [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2986.22s)]
*  how finance works at all. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2988.14s)]
*  It is crazy, right? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2989.46s)]
*  You're teaching kids about how to prepare yourself [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2990.66s)]
*  for the world and you don't teach them about debt [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2992.78s)]
*  and about interest. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2995.7400000000002s)]
*  The first thing that happens [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2996.58s)]
*  when you're a freshman in college [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2998.34s)]
*  is you walk through the student union [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=2999.78s)]
*  and they go, you want a credit card? [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3001.62s)]
*  You're fucking 18. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3003.14s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, it's got 29.9% APR, it's awesome. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3004.9s)]
*  They're preying upon you. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3008.1s)]
*  They're literally preying upon you. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3009.7s)]
*  And the school lets it. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3010.94s)]
*  The school is like, yeah, go ahead. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3012.42s)]
*  They don't give a fuck about you. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3014.18s)]
*  You're grist for the mill. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3015.7s)]
*  Literally, you're paying fucking, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3019.2999999999997s)]
*  you're gonna end up paying $300 for a Coke you bought. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3022.02s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3024.9399999999996s)]
*  Because you just like scammed it. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3025.7799999999997s)]
*  This is insane. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3027.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's insane. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3028.58s)]
*  We don't teach anybody. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3029.4199999999996s)]
*  It's really crazy. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3030.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, also, you get it in their head that they're fucked [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3031.62s)]
*  because the debt that they're getting involved in [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3035.54s)]
*  with student loans is the only debt we have [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3038.62s)]
*  that you can't get rid of. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3041.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3042.58s)]
*  The only debt. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3043.46s)]
*  Yeah, you can't forgive that. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3044.7s)]
*  There are people right now [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3045.54s)]
*  who have Social Security getting docked. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3047.1s)]
*  Their Social Security's getting docked for student loans. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3050.06s)]
*  For their student loans. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3053.22s)]
*  So they made it to death [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3054.06s)]
*  and they owe money to the government for loans [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3055.7s)]
*  that did them no good at all [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3057.74s)]
*  because they're living off Social Security. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3059.1s)]
*  So the government gets to steal more money [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3061.3s)]
*  from your Social Security. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3063.02s)]
*  Nah, we don't have to pay you. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3063.86s)]
*  So nuts. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3066.3s)]
*  And meanwhile, like today, the reality is [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3067.14s)]
*  you can get that education online. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3071.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3073.5s)]
*  All of the books on any sort of subject are available. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3074.6200000000003s)]
*  Mine is useless. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3080.6600000000003s)]
*  My degree's useless. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3081.6200000000003s)]
*  What's yours in? [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3082.46s)]
*  Communications. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3083.3s)]
*  Well, you're a communicator. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3084.1400000000003s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3085.06s)]
*  Worked out. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3085.9s)]
*  You probably, like, they use you to sell more tickets. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3086.7400000000002s)]
*  They probably do. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3088.42s)]
*  This guy. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3089.78s)]
*  Look, he went to our university. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3090.6200000000003s)]
*  You should come. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3092.06s)]
*  Learn like Tom. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3093.94s)]
*  You know, I didn't, like, you don't, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3094.98s)]
*  I didn't learn anything. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3096.7400000000002s)]
*  But how much did you have to pay to go to school? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3098.86s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3100.86s)]
*  Back to when you were in debt for. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3101.7000000000003s)]
*  How much was the tuition? [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3103.18s)]
*  I think tuition when I was there [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3104.98s)]
*  was something like six or 7,000 a semester. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3107.74s)]
*  So like 12, 13 a year. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3110.02s)]
*  Which, you know, whatever. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3112.66s)]
*  Now, fucking, tuitions now are like [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3113.7s)]
*  50, $80,000 a year. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3117.18s)]
*  It's great. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3119.2599999999998s)]
*  So imagine you take on that loan. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3120.2999999999997s)]
*  You start your workforce. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3121.7s)]
*  You have $300,000 in loans. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3123.2999999999997s)]
*  And God forbid you go to graduate school. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3126.3399999999997s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3128.02s)]
*  Or compounds. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3128.8599999999997s)]
*  And then you're never getting out of the hole. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3129.7s)]
*  I mean, I think this is why some doctors and lawyers [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3131.14s)]
*  become sociopaths. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3133.3399999999997s)]
*  Because you are dealing with so much debt [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3134.7799999999997s)]
*  and you realize no one gives a fuck about you. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3137.74s)]
*  So you don't give a fuck about anybody else either. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3139.38s)]
*  Wow. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3141.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's great for society. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3142.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3144.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3145.8199999999997s)]
*  It's also like, there's two things that can be true, right? [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3147.7s)]
*  I do think that you kind of have to, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3150.74s)]
*  kids have to like get to work and get something going [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3152.9s)]
*  and get a path in your life. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3157.54s)]
*  And when you're going to college, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3159.14s)]
*  it's like you're out of high school. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3160.42s)]
*  Okay, now you're on your own. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3161.46s)]
*  You're in college. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3163.02s)]
*  You gotta keep up your GPA. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3164.02s)]
*  You gotta get your degree. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3165.2200000000003s)]
*  Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3166.2200000000003s)]
*  So there is value in that. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3168.06s)]
*  But then also it's too much money [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3170.2200000000003s)]
*  and you're probably not gonna do anything with that degree. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3173.54s)]
*  And if you don't have the degree, [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3177.38s)]
*  people think you're a loser. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3178.46s)]
*  And it's very strange. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3180.42s)]
*  It's very strange what's going on [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3182.46s)]
*  because you're allowing these corporations [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3183.94s)]
*  to prey upon children. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3187.3s)]
*  Because you're an 18 year old child. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3189.54s)]
*  You don't understand anything. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3192.06s)]
*  You don't understand anything. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3193.1s)]
*  And then all of a sudden you're in college [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3194.46s)]
*  and you're saddled down with unstoppable debt [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3196.1400000000003s)]
*  and you have this fucking circus of people around you [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3199.06s)]
*  that are also trapped. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3202.2200000000003s)]
*  And you didn't understand what that meant, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3203.38s)]
*  what you were signing up for. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3205.54s)]
*  No way. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3206.94s)]
*  It's the same reason you have a conversation [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3207.78s)]
*  with somebody who's that age and you're like, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3210.3s)]
*  oh, you realize that our brains are different, right? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3212.42s)]
*  Like you talked to like a. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3214.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, they're not developed yet. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3215.6600000000003s)]
*  They're not fully developed yet. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3216.82s)]
*  They don't understand everything. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3217.9s)]
*  Especially boys. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3218.74s)]
*  Way, way more clearly. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3219.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, boys don't get developed until they're like 25. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3221.4199999999996s)]
*  Girls are pretty, they can figure out the game earlier. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3224.14s)]
*  They're not as saddled down by testosterone. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3228.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they're. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3230.3399999999997s)]
*  But their frontal lobe develops earlier. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3231.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, ours does really take till about 25. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3233.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, future retarded. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3235.62s)]
*  But that's also how you trick them into going to war. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3237.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3239.1s)]

*  How are you not in jail? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3264.42s)]
*  How's no one in jail for faking things to start wars? [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3265.98s)]
*  Zero accountability. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3269.62s)]
*  So then you're like, well, fuck it. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3271.42s)]
*  They got me with the student loan. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3273.18s)]
*  They got me with this. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3274.7s)]
*  They got me with that. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3275.54s)]
*  And you just get accustomed to life fucking you. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3276.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3279.6600000000003s)]
*  You're just like, oh, the society just fucks you over. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3280.5s)]
*  They just take from you, take from you. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3283.34s)]
*  Did I saddle you with debt? [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3285.26s)]
*  Tell you this theory, what you're talking about [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3286.54s)]
*  applies to, I think extends to our appearances. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3289.82s)]
*  And what I mean is today, a lot of times people talk about [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3294.58s)]
*  how people wear like fucking flip flops and pajamas. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3298.34s)]
*  You talking about Birdigan? [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3302.42s)]
*  Yeah, well. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3303.58s)]
*  He's not here. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3305.02s)]
*  To defend himself, I think this is rude. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3306.1400000000003s)]
*  But like you get on a plane [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3308.34s)]
*  and you see people in pajamas, right? [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3309.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3311.78s)]
*  And 50 years ago, they'd be like in a suit. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3312.6200000000003s)]
*  And I think part of the reason why people, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3316.06s)]
*  their appearance is this. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3320.54s)]
*  I think some of it is tied to a lack of hope. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3322.1800000000003s)]
*  Meaning that so many years ago, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3326.02s)]
*  you would embark on your path in life, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3328.94s)]
*  thinking that there's hope. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3333.5s)]
*  I can have the American dream. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3335.38s)]
*  I can own the house. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3337.1000000000004s)]
*  I can get the things I wanna get. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3338.34s)]
*  And so many people today are like, there is no hope. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3340.5800000000004s)]
*  So fuck it. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3344.1800000000003s)]
*  I'll go out in my fucking sleepwear. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3347.1800000000003s)]
*  There's a little bit of that. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3349.86s)]
*  I think there's a connection to that. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3350.94s)]
*  Well, there's a lot to that too, [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3353.2200000000003s)]
*  that if the government wants, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3355.7400000000002s)]
*  if they want control and power, [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3359.1800000000003s)]
*  which is ultimately what every government wants. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3361.38s)]
*  It's not a conspiracy theory. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3363.6200000000003s)]
*  Every government wants control and power. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3365.34s)]
*  What's the best way to acquire control and power? [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3366.5s)]
*  How do the people give up? [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3368.5800000000004s)]
*  How do they give up? [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3369.98s)]
*  Yeah, they're just fucking, I give up. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3370.82s)]
*  I give up. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3372.3s)]
*  Fuck it, I'm wearing flip flops. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3373.1400000000003s)]

*  Because that means I'll do what you say. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3375.94s)]
*  I'll do what you say when you give up. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3377.86s)]
*  That's what's really scary to me about AI, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3379.02s)]
*  automation, and then ultimately universal basic income. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3383.78s)]
*  You're gonna get a lot of giving up. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3388.2200000000003s)]
*  And then the government's gonna clamp down on you even more. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3391.06s)]
*  And then it's gonna be haves and have-nots [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3394.22s)]
*  out of scale that we've never seen before. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3396.22s)]
*  When you have companies that are in charge [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3399.02s)]
*  of these automated taxi services, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3402.4199999999996s)]

*  and the government gives you a certain amount of credits [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3406.62s)]
*  so you don't have to ever worry about traveling, [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3408.46s)]

*  you don't say anything crazy about this or about that, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3425.02s)]
*  or take your vaccines. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3426.98s)]
*  And if that's a real possibility, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3428.54s)]
*  that they're just gonna extract money out of us, [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3432.2999999999997s)]
*  or attempt to, attempt to control. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3437.1s)]
*  This is the grand battle of control. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3440.02s)]
*  The more they have power over narratives, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3444.14s)]
*  it's also like, there's things that are going on right now. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3447.66s)]
*  We were just talking about, some friends this weekend, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3451.42s)]
*  we're talking about these bot farms, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3454.54s)]
*  like this evidence of bot farms that people have used [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3457.02s)]
*  to go and attack people with certain things. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3460.42s)]
*  A bunch of different countries use bot farms. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3466.58s)]
*  I'm sure a bunch of different corporations [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3468.82s)]
*  use bot farms too, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3470.9s)]
*  but no one's getting in trouble for it. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3472.06s)]
*  If you can pretend that your mass groups of people [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3474.78s)]
*  that are getting upset about something, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3479.94s)]
*  you could just pretend, and there's no, you could pretend. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3483.1000000000004s)]
*  You can hire people to go protest and fly them in on jets. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3487.2200000000003s)]
*  That's happening right now. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3492.46s)]
*  There was this guy in Maine, and he made this video [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3493.7000000000003s)]
*  where he was hired to drive these people to the airport, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3497.02s)]
*  and he's trying to figure out, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3501.1400000000003s)]
*  where are all these people going? [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3503.0600000000004s)]
*  I'm driving this busload, two busloads [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3504.1000000000004s)]
*  full of people at the airport. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3506.1000000000004s)]
*  They were saying, well, we're going to a protest. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3508.62s)]
*  What protest? [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3511.54s)]
*  Then he goes and Googles where they're flying to. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3512.3799999999997s)]
*  He's like, oh, this is a paid protest. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3514.7s)]
*  They're paying people to show up [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3517.14s)]
*  and pretend that it's a protest. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3519.3399999999997s)]
*  So it's like, there's puppet masters [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3521.18s)]
*  that are manipulating world events, and that's legal. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3523.58s)]
*  You're allowed to pay people to go protest, [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3527.54s)]
*  which seems like that should be illegal. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3530.18s)]

*  I'd have no idea. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3597.58s)]
*  Can you get an Apple ID? [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3598.54s)]
*  Does it work? [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3599.98s)]
*  It can't. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3600.98s)]
*  I'm imagining it that it can't. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3602.02s)]
*  But I always think about the fact with AI [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3604.1s)]
*  how we're in version one [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3608.06s)]
*  and we're all blown away by it already. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3611.06s)]
*  And there was a watch guy online [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3614.18s)]
*  who was like, I have two Daytonas. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3616.74s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3620.42s)]
*  And he was like, dude. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3621.5s)]
*  He goes, this is the best one I've ever seen. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3624.1s)]
*  Fakes, yeah. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3626.5s)]
*  The fake, he had to take it apart [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3627.46s)]
*  and to look at parts that were inside. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3630.7400000000002s)]
*  Like a spin wheel. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3633.34s)]
*  He goes, oh, this is missing the logo. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3634.2200000000003s)]
*  So which begs the question, like what is it? [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3635.98s)]
*  Like, what are you buying? [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3638.46s)]
*  Do you want it from this company only [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3639.7400000000002s)]
*  or do you want a Rolex Daytona? [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3641.7s)]
*  Like, what do you want? [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3644.42s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think if in the case of that, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3645.26s)]
*  you know that the movements, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3648.94s)]
*  the actual inner workings of the real one are far superior. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3652.54s)]
*  Are they though? [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3656.94s)]
*  I think so, yeah. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3657.78s)]
*  Why? [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3658.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3659.7000000000003s)]
*  Well, I assume that. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3660.52s)]
*  What if the other one has a 72 hour battery [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3661.36s)]
*  or a power supply too? [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3663.62s)]
*  What if you 3D print every single aspect of the watch? [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3666.62s)]
*  I wouldn't know. That's the same thing. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3671.26s)]
*  Pretty close, I guess. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3673.02s)]
*  But it can be the same thing. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3674.14s)]
*  Like we're not talking, like my watch, [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3675.86s)]
*  there's a Panerai. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3678.58s)]
*  This could be fake. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3680.26s)]
*  I mean, I bought it from my friend, so I'm sure it's real. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3681.42s)]
*  But like, it's not a fake Ferrari. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3683.9s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3686.82s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3687.66s)]
*  Like you got a fake Ferrari, like, oh my God, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3688.5s)]
*  these tires have no traction. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3689.46s)]
*  This suspension sucks. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3691.62s)]
*  I hate the idea of fake watch though. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3693.06s)]
*  Right, but why? [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3694.9s)]
*  Well, it used to be poor. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3696.5s)]
*  Maybe it's because I used to be poor. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3698.06s)]
*  I also just don't respect the copying of it. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3699.62s)]
*  Right, it's bullshit. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3703.7400000000002s)]
*  Well, you know, I wouldn't buy one [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3705.1800000000003s)]
*  because you're contributing to. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3706.92s)]
*  But it's kind of funny. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3709.2200000000003s)]
*  It is kind of funny. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3711.38s)]
*  You can get one for $40. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3712.38s)]
*  That's like a $7,000 watch. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3714.7000000000003s)]
*  It's really crazy. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3716.86s)]
*  It's insane. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3718.26s)]
*  And it's insane that it's tricking these watch experts. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3719.1000000000004s)]
*  Right? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3722.9s)]
*  But I don't really understand the... [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3723.82s)]
*  Yeah, look at these. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3725.6600000000003s)]
*  So one of those is fake? [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3726.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, the right. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3728.5s)]
*  The one on the right is fake? [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3729.34s)]
*  Yeah, I'd buy that. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3730.5800000000004s)]
*  Looks perfect. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3731.42s)]
*  I'll take it. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3732.26s)]
*  How much? [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3733.34s)]
*  He's pointing out. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3734.1800000000003s)]
*  Look at you, see the difference? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3735.86s)]
*  Imagine. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3738.1s)]
*  Who knows this on the spot? [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3738.94s)]
*  Well, also. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3740.2999999999997s)]

*  Mine does too. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3744.22s)]
*  So I'd have to like take it out and do this. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3745.7s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3747.8599999999997s)]
*  Like this one, I can't even... [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3748.74s)]
*  I guess I can read the time. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3751.22s)]
*  Look at these. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3753.1s)]
*  Or read the date rather. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3753.94s)]
*  But I mean, they're... [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3754.7799999999997s)]

*  what you're doing in the watch thing, right? [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3778.1s)]
*  Then the person buys the far less expensive one [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3780.66s)]
*  and they get the feeling, I guess, [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3784.22s)]
*  that people go, oh, you have the real one. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3785.58s)]

*  That's the craziest part. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3810.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's like it's layers of severance. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3811.94s)]

*  It's a guy that just works on cars, dope shit. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3823.58s)]
*  And one of the things he's doing, [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3826.8199999999997s)]
*  he's building his own Ferrari F40. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3827.94s)]
*  That's cool. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3831.14s)]
*  So instead of buying one for like $3 million, [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3831.98s)]
*  which is... [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3834.58s)]
*  Okay, I'm gonna say something [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3835.74s)]
*  that's gonna piss off these Ferrari people. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3837.38s)]
*  It ain't worth it. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3839.8599999999997s)]
*  Okay, it's not worth $3 million. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3841.2599999999998s)]
*  It's not that good. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3842.9s)]
*  It was new today. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3843.74s)]
*  You'd be like, this should be taking off the market. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3845.9s)]
*  Like this thing has zero fucking traction control. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3848.8599999999997s)]
*  But because it's a classic, it's worth like a ton of money. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3851.02s)]
*  So what he's doing is making it better. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3854.38s)]
*  Stance Works. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3856.7s)]

*  Stance Elements... [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3864.3s)]
*  How did I fuck that up? [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3865.62s)]
*  Stance Elements, by the way, is also amazing. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3866.98s)]
*  We can talk about that. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3869.14s)]
*  But this guy, Stance Works, this is his own... [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3869.98s)]
*  That's not a Ferrari. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3873.82s)]
*  He's building it from scratch. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3875.14s)]
*  He bought all the parts online. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3875.98s)]
*  So he bought all the body panels online. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3877.86s)]
*  And then he made his own frame. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3880.18s)]
*  And then he bought a Ferrari engine [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3882.06s)]
*  from like a different model of Ferrari. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3884.18s)]
*  And he's putting that in it. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3886.46s)]
*  But this is like a multi-month journey [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3888.2599999999998s)]
*  that this dude has been on, [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3892.14s)]
*  that I've been watching all the videos. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3893.34s)]
*  Whenever he has a new video, I watch it. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3895.22s)]
*  He does a lot of dope shit, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3896.94s)]
*  but this is a guy that like really loves cars [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3898.58s)]
*  and he's super smart. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3902.1s)]

*  Cause like, he's also a fan of the original M5, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3905.42s)]
*  which I've thought about getting one of those. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3910.86s)]
*  Not very fast, but apparently like super engaging [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3911.9s)]
*  driving experience. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3915.46s)]
*  The original M5, which I think was like... [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3916.66s)]
*  I wanna say it was like 280 horsepower. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=3922.2200000000003s)]

*  And guess what? [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4133.02s)]
*  The emotion almost ended up wrapped around [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4133.86s)]
*  a fucking light pole. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4135.26s)]
*  Did you spin? [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4136.1s)]
*  Dude, I was like, I corrected it, [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4136.94s)]
*  but I was like panicked and I was like [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4139.02s)]
*  fucking driving this guy. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4141.18s)]
*  That's the fear of losing it in a Porsche. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4142.02s)]
*  That rear engine whip. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4144.1s)]
*  You know, that understeer that happens? [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4145.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4148.14s)]
*  Or oversteer. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4148.9800000000005s)]
*  What is it called? [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4149.820000000001s)]
*  Supply throttle, something throttle oversteer? [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4150.64s)]
*  When you lift. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4153.540000000001s)]
*  When you lift. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4154.540000000001s)]
*  Lift throttle oversteer. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4155.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4156.22s)]
*  And then the back end goes on you. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4157.06s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4158.860000000001s)]
*  It's a weird design. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4159.700000000001s)]
*  Like having the engine out back like that. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4160.900000000001s)]
*  This thing also happens in everybody's mind. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4162.46s)]
*  Who hasn't, who is not, [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4165.34s)]
*  it's literally something you have to be trained. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4167.18s)]
*  Which is that when something, when you're in a car [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4169.58s)]
*  and you're at a certain rate of speed [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4172.860000000001s)]
*  and you're approaching a turn or something, [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4175.400000000001s)]
*  you feel anything going on you, [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4178.46s)]
*  you take your foot off the throttle. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4180.700000000001s)]
*  And what you don't realize is that that is gonna, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4182.34s)]
*  it's gonna make things worse. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4186.18s)]
*  Because the momentum and the weight [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4187.860000000001s)]
*  are gonna be carried through. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4190.240000000001s)]
*  And actually the only thing that'll keep you [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4191.900000000001s)]
*  from usually losing it is to stay on throttle. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4193.5s)]
*  Not necessarily give it a ton. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4196.54s)]
*  You need that momentum to carry you through it. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4198.62s)]
*  And so it's just something that, [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4201.62s)]
*  there's countless videos of somebody [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4203.42s)]
*  in their new fucking car just going, [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4205.46s)]
*  and they just go into a tree. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4207.0199999999995s)]
*  I just watched one on a new GT3 RS. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4208.9s)]
*  I've seen that one. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4210.94s)]
*  Brutal, he's like 18. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4212.34s)]
*  And he did exactly that. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4213.74s)]
*  He hits the turn, off throttle, tries to correct. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4215.7s)]
*  Bye. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4218.66s)]
*  Bye bye. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4219.5s)]
*  Fuck, painful to watch. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4220.58s)]
*  Painful. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4222.74s)]
*  But that is a bad element of that design. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4223.58s)]
*  The rear weight. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4225.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4226.5s)]
*  But also it's like, is that really the best way to do it? [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4227.34s)]
*  Because everybody always said that the Cayman [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4229.98s)]
*  is the better car if they just gave it the same sort of love [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4232.42s)]
*  that they give the Porsche. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4235.5s)]
*  I fucking love that car. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4236.7s)]
*  I love it. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4238.18s)]
*  It's like my heart is with that car. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4239.58s)]
*  If you go, what's the one you're in love with the most? [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4243.74s)]
*  It's still that car. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4246.0199999999995s)]
*  But isn't it interesting that that car [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4246.98s)]
*  is not as prestigious? [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4249.18s)]
*  It's not as prestigious, yeah. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4250.54s)]
*  Why is that? [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4251.82s)]
*  That seems stupid. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4252.66s)]
*  It's a whole thing too, Pete. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4253.48s)]
*  You'll see people like, ah, you got the Cayman. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4255.08s)]
*  You should have gotten the 911. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4256.92s)]
*  I'm like, you should drive this fucking thing. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4257.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4259.5599999999995s)]
*  But people that say that are all retarded. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4260.4s)]
*  They kind of are. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4261.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4262.759999999999s)]
*  Anybody that says that is an idiot. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4263.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, you don't know anything about cars. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4264.92s)]
*  Mid-engine. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4266.5599999999995s)]
*  Because you have a Dynan, right? [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4267.48s)]
*  No, it's not Dynan. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4269.32s)]
*  What's the company? [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4270.16s)]
*  Dynan did my BMW. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4271.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4272.36s)]
*  What's your company? [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4273.2s)]
*  For that one, [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4274.84s)]
*  DEMON. DEMON. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4275.84s)]
*  Yeah, Rick DEMON did the upgrade on that. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4276.679999999999s)]
*  So what that is, is what it should be from Porsche. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4279.44s)]
*  They should take that big juicy GT3 RS engine, [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4283.6s)]
*  or even crazier, take that GT2 RS. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4287.160000000001s)]
*  Throw it in that bitch. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4289.68s)]
*  Throw it in that bitch. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4290.52s)]
*  It just upsets 911 owners, that's it. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4291.360000000001s)]
*  It just fucks up their... [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4293.08s)]
*  There we go, a bunch of little fairies. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4293.92s)]
*  Yeah, prestige. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4295.76s)]
*  If that upsets you, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4296.6s)]
*  then you need to go find something else. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4297.88s)]
*  You need to go do mushrooms on the mountain top somewhere. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4300.06s)]
*  By the way, did you like that? [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4302.08s)]
*  You feel it at all? [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4303.160000000001s)]
*  I don't know what you're talking about. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4304.0s)]
*  No? [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4304.820000000001s)]
*  Did you ever drive the GT4 RS they came out with [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4307.240000000001s)]
*  like a year or two ago? [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4309.76s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4310.72s)]
*  I heard it. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4311.56s)]
*  I didn't drive it yet. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4312.38s)]
*  But it's also an automatic. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4313.860000000001s)]
*  It's all automatic. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4314.7s)]
*  Come on, you pussies. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4315.54s)]
*  What are we doing? [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4316.780000000001s)]
*  Why are you buying a street car? [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4317.62s)]
*  Are you a crazy track guy? [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4320.46s)]
*  Because that's a track car. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4322.54s)]
*  Which is fine. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4324.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4324.860000000001s)]
*  Which is fine. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4325.68s)]
*  But for the average person that enjoys, [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4326.52s)]
*  make an enthusiast car that's a goddamn three pedal. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4330.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4334.740000000001s)]
*  Make a manual. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4335.58s)]
*  Well thank God they still do. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4336.58s)]
*  They make some. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4338.26s)]
*  I mean a lot of places just don't. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4339.1s)]
*  I still think... [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4341.34s)]
*  BMW, Ford still makes them. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4342.22s)]
*  They still do it with their Mustangs. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4344.58s)]
*  I can't believe that Ferrari doesn't realize [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4345.9400000000005s)]
*  that if they did just a limited run. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4348.900000000001s)]
*  Oh my God, it would sell like crazy. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4351.02s)]
*  It would sell so crazy. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4352.42s)]
*  Yeah, they gave up. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4353.9400000000005s)]
*  They gave up. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4354.9800000000005s)]
*  Lamborghini gave up. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4355.820000000001s)]
*  I wish they would. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4356.64s)]
*  Thank God Porsche didn't. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4357.54s)]
*  No, I know. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4358.62s)]
*  But they did with some cars. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4359.46s)]
*  Like a lot of their cars, you can't get the GTS now [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4361.360000000001s)]
*  in a five speed. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4364.8s)]
*  You can't. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4365.9400000000005s)]
*  Or excuse me, a six speed or a seven speed, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4366.780000000001s)]
*  whatever the fuck they have now. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4368.6s)]
*  I don't think you can get the S. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4370.9400000000005s)]
*  You can't get the turbo. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4372.3s)]
*  Oh you can't get the turbo, yeah. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4373.38s)]
*  You have to get the T or the regular. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4374.38s)]
*  Maybe you can get the regular 911. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4377.66s)]
*  I think you can get a regular 911 Carrera. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4379.02s)]
*  GT3 you can get still, but you can't get the GT3 RS. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4381.22s)]
*  Like come on guys, shut up. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4384.860000000001s)]
*  Just shut up. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4387.66s)]
*  I think the audience should inform them. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4388.54s)]
*  They should know that their fan base [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4392.26s)]
*  wants all that shit in manuals. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4395.42s)]
*  This pisses me off about Corvette too. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4397.06s)]
*  Like you guys have the most dope shape now. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4400.42s)]
*  The C8 Corvette is so sick. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4402.9800000000005s)]
*  And you're putting out these insane ones [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4405.3s)]
*  like the Z06 and the ZR1. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4407.9800000000005s)]
*  But it's still, [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4410.38s)]
*  bing, bing, bing, bing. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4411.240000000001s)]
*  People want to, I don't know. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4414.38s)]
*  It's gotta be like, all that has to be cost analysis, right? [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4416.9800000000005s)]
*  It's a little bit of that. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4420.56s)]
*  And what is that, Rogue? [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4421.860000000001s)]
*  I kinda quit those, but oh one. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4423.46s)]
*  I thought I was gonna have a hard time. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4427.02s)]
*  I quit them over the weekend. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4428.34s)]
*  Really? [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4429.780000000001s)]
*  I did nothing. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4430.620000000001s)]
*  I was like, this is easy. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4431.4400000000005s)]
*  I think I'm lucky. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4432.34s)]
*  With your... [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4434.34s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think I get physically addicted to stuff [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4435.18s)]
*  that way, except coffee. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4438.660000000001s)]
*  I've done that one where I took the whole day off coffee [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4441.660000000001s)]
*  and I was like, why am I fucking yawning? [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4443.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4446.06s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4448.900000000001s)]
*  Coffee gets me too, headaches. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4449.780000000001s)]
*  But I like coffee so much and coffee's everywhere. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4451.700000000001s)]
*  I'm like, I don't think I need to quit that one. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4453.9400000000005s)]
*  No. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4455.42s)]
*  I didn't get headaches last time I tried to quit coffee. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4456.62s)]
*  I quit for a couple days and I was like, this is just rough. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4459.12s)]
*  But the nicotine pouches was nothing. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4463.46s)]
*  That's great. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4465.38s)]
*  It was super easy. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4466.22s)]
*  I feel like I have some of that [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4467.82s)]
*  where I'm not that physically addicted to it. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4469.82s)]
*  But dude, I have friends that have like, [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4473.5s)]
*  anything gets them. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4475.38s)]
*  Like, I had a guy who came over here to do a podcast [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4476.82s)]
*  and he saw that someone had sent us some kratom stuff [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4479.5s)]
*  that I wound up throwing out. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4482.1s)]
*  I was like, I don't want this shit anyway. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4483.34s)]
*  And he's like, don't take that. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4486.26s)]
*  I can't get off of it. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4487.18s)]
*  Get that kratom away from me. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4488.74s)]
*  I know someone who's- [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4490.38s)]
*  I got a real problem with it. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4491.22s)]
*  I'm like, really? [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4492.06s)]

*  Well, cause they were using it to get off of opiates. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4500.34s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4503.34s)]

*  It's a tiny little shot. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4554.36s)]
*  That's a good way to get you onto it. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4555.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's like when you buy a bag of chips [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4556.88s)]
*  and it says how many calories in it per serving. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4558.639999999999s)]
*  Six chips. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4561.599999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4569.62s)]
*  It's a garbage tactic to get people into it. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4570.46s)]
*  It's so predatory. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4574.78s)]
*  It's just lies. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4575.86s)]
*  You're lying about the amount of calories. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4577.14s)]
*  That's so funny, dude. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4579.94s)]
*  But I think I'm very lucky. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4581.38s)]
*  Because I know people that get addicted to weed. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4584.06s)]
*  I have gone a long time without weed [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4588.3s)]
*  and never had any problem. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4591.62s)]
*  Yeah, people get physically addicted. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4593.62s)]
*  Like, I didn't really realize that was a thing. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4595.82s)]
*  But I think it's just different genetics. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4597.58s)]
*  Look at Burt. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4601.42s)]
*  A normal person who drinks as much as him would be dead. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4602.34s)]
*  You'd have real liver problems [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4605.38s)]
*  and he doesn't have any problems. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4607.74s)]
*  He's in the gym in the morning. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4609.54s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4610.54s)]
*  It's nuts. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4611.38s)]
*  So it's like, you just gotta deal with the cards you dealt. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4612.22s)]
*  Like, why don't I have four aces? [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4615.14s)]

*  and you can make them happen. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4664.139999999999s)]
*  Not really. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4665.46s)]
*  That's bullshit. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4666.58s)]

*  It's an obsession. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4703.42s)]

*  without having to deal with the problem. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4708.58s)]

*  Did you hear about that lady that got fired [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4816.14s)]
*  from Equinox in Manhattan? [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4817.62s)]
*  She was late 47 times in 10 months. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4819.9800000000005s)]

*  She said she got fired for racism and she won. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4826.46s)]
*  She won. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4828.74s)]
*  It's a jury and she won $11 million? [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4829.58s)]
*  No. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4831.86s)]
*  Yes, she did. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4832.7s)]
*  No, and she was late 47 times. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4833.54s)]
*  Not only that, you were working at Equinox. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4835.66s)]
*  You could work for all of time [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4838.1s)]
*  and you'll never make $11 million. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4841.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4843.42s)]
*  You're not gonna make $11 million working at Equinox. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4845.26s)]
*  But yet you won and she only worked there for 10 months. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4847.42s)]
*  She was late 47 times in 10 months. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4851.26s)]
*  And that's why they were firing her? [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4853.74s)]
*  You're just perpetually late. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4855.42s)]
*  They're like, bitch, you are always late. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4856.26s)]
*  And then she's like, that was so racist. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4858.46s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4860.9400000000005s)]
*  And she won and she took him to court and won. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4861.78s)]
*  They're definitely gonna appeal that shit. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4864.1s)]
*  Of course they're gonna appeal. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4865.82s)]
*  But the thing is, when you have a jury, [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4866.66s)]
*  you have a jury of people so fucking stupid [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4869.86s)]
*  they don't get out of jury duty. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4872.66s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4874.06s)]
*  And they might be like, yeah, fuck Equinox, man. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4877.9400000000005s)]
*  Give it to her. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4882.02s)]
*  That fucking fuck the man, man. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4882.86s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4886.66s)]
*  He's like, fucking Equinox. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4887.5s)]
*  Of course, not just that, it's a corporation. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4888.34s)]
*  You don't think of it as an individual. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4890.42s)]
*  That's just a company that's gonna fuck you over. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4892.1s)]
*  That's why people don't feel bad stealing from work. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4894.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4897.02s)]
*  You don't feel like you're stealing. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4897.86s)]
*  If someone was working in your house [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4899.3s)]
*  and they were stealing from you, [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4900.82s)]
*  they stole your fork, so where's my fucking fork? [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4902.26s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4904.3s)]
*  This is bullshit. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4905.14s)]
*  And then you find out a guy would work for you, [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4905.9800000000005s)]
*  stole your fork, you're fucking fired. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4907.9400000000005s)]
*  But if an office, if someone takes a fork home, [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4910.22s)]
*  if you have a kitchen in your office, [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4914.18s)]
*  we use a bunch of forks for staff, [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4915.860000000001s)]
*  and someone takes that fork, it's no big deal. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4918.38s)]
*  It's the office's fork. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4920.1s)]
*  We just need to order more forks, man. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4920.9400000000005s)]
*  These fucking forks keep disappearing. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4922.5s)]
*  And you go over Tom's house one day, [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4924.3s)]
*  and Tom's got four of the office forks. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4925.860000000001s)]
*  Did you just steal the office forks? [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4928.06s)]
*  I forgot. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4929.3s)]
*  I forgot. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4930.14s)]
*  I just keep forgetting to bring them back. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4930.9800000000005s)]
*  Because they don't belong to somebody. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4932.1s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4933.14s)]
*  It's not a human, it's a corporation, [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4933.9800000000005s)]
*  which is also why corporations can act [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4936.06s)]
*  like fucking psychopaths, [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4938.38s)]
*  because they're also not a human, [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4940.34s)]
*  so they can just do whatever the fuck they have to do, [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4941.86s)]
*  which is why our food supply's so bad. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4944.38s)]
*  Because they're just trying to maximize profit. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4945.98s)]
*  They literally have a duty to maximize profit. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4948.0599999999995s)]
*  My mom definitely thinks of corporations [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4950.38s)]
*  as they can deal with it. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4954.0599999999995s)]
*  Of course. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4956.0199999999995s)]
*  And I remember my dad used to tell this story [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4956.86s)]
*  that when they first got married, [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4958.58s)]
*  they were at a Holiday Inn, and they were leaving. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4960.5s)]
*  And then he was like, what is that in the suitcase? [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4963.58s)]
*  And it was their towels. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4965.82s)]
*  And she was like, the towels. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4967.58s)]
*  And he's like, you can't take that. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4969.099999999999s)]
*  She was like, why? [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4970.46s)]
*  Because it belongs to the Holiday Inn. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4972.06s)]
*  It's theirs. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4974.26s)]
*  And she was like, they have like 100 of them. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4975.42s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, it's not ours, though. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4977.860000000001s)]
*  We can't. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4979.18s)]
*  And she was like, it's fine. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4980.02s)]
*  And everywhere I've gone with her, [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4983.1s)]
*  she's like, you know, she'd be like, can I take this? [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4985.38s)]
*  I'm like, no. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4988.22s)]
*  That's so funny. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4989.06s)]
*  We've been places where I've been like, [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4990.02s)]
*  hey, sorry, my mom wondering if we could take this glass. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4991.9400000000005s)]
*  Pfft. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4995.9400000000005s)]
*  She makes you ask? [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4996.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=4999.1s)]
*  I saw a video you were showing your mom these clips. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5001.7s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5004.139999999999s)]
*  The clips from your new Netflix show. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5004.98s)]
*  Oh, it was fucking amazing. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5006.219999999999s)]
*  It was amazing. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5007.66s)]
*  I knew it was gonna be a killer. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5008.62s)]
*  I was like, she's gonna hate it. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5011.58s)]
*  And they were like, okay. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5012.9s)]
*  So we set up a private screening for her. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5014.3s)]
*  It's also like, why am I watching this? [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5016.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't know if you know, but you're my mom. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5017.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5019.219999999999s)]
*  It's just so funny. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5020.0599999999995s)]
*  She's like, dude, she fucking, [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5021.0599999999995s)]
*  she hated the show so much. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5023.98s)]
*  She's like, she came over yesterday for Mother's Day. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5025.3s)]
*  And I was like, she goes, so. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5029.98s)]
*  Cause on the rest of that thing, [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5031.54s)]
*  she made me promise that we're gonna cut the first story. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5033.66s)]
*  She was like, you're definitely not gonna use that, right? [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5038.219999999999s)]
*  So eventually I was like, yeah, we're cutting it. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5040.42s)]
*  But. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5042.82s)]
*  And so yesterday she was like, did you cut it? [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5043.66s)]
*  I go, of course not. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5045.74s)]
*  It's fucking, it's Netflix's. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5046.86s)]
*  And she was like, you lied to me. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5048.98s)]
*  And I'm like, mom, I can't be like, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5051.259999999999s)]

*  Do you know how much of a fucking burden it is [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5068.5s)]
*  to have to babysit when you're there? [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5070.42s)]
*  I was talking to Shane Gillis about a bit he does [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5071.98s)]
*  where people getting upset, [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5073.94s)]

*  And he's like, yeah, I'll stop doing that. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5077.98s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5079.82s)]
*  Shut up. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5080.66s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5081.5s)]
*  She found out by the way, [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5082.34s)]
*  I was on Chrissy D and Yannis' podcast [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5083.42s)]
*  the day the Pope died or the day after. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5086.94s)]
*  I was in New York and we're podcasting [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5090.62s)]
*  and I was like, oh, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5092.7s)]
*  cause my mom's like hardcore Catholic. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5093.66s)]
*  And I was like, let's call her and just check on her. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5096.5s)]
*  And I go, we'll just try to see if maybe the Jews did it. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5100.179999999999s)]
*  So I call her, I'm like, did you hear about the Pope? [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5102.94s)]
*  And she's like, I am devastated to me. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5109.379999999999s)]
*  I go, I don't know what happened, if he was sick, [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5112.0199999999995s)]
*  if it was the Jews. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5114.339999999999s)]
*  And she's like, what? [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5115.299999999999s)]
*  And like we had to cover our mouths. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5117.62s)]
*  We had to cover our mouths and mute the phone. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5119.9s)]
*  She's like, she goes, [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5123.5s)]
*  this is the craziest call I've ever received. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5124.98s)]
*  The Pope died, do you think the Jews did it? [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5127.82s)]
*  I'm like, I had to hang up the phone. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5130.099999999999s)]
*  And then like a week later, she goes, [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5134.98s)]
*  I was on YouTube and I find that you called me [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5137.099999999999s)]
*  on a show to talk about. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5141.62s)]
*  Yeah, she's finally found herself on YouTube. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5143.0599999999995s)]
*  She found the clip, yeah. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5145.9s)]
*  She found the endless well of us [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5147.9s)]
*  fucking with her on YouTube. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5149.78s)]
*  Oh my God, that's so funny. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5150.86s)]
*  Speaking of the Jews, [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5152.98s)]
*  have you seen fucking Kanye's new song? [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5153.82s)]
*  Bro. Bro. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5156.259999999999s)]
*  What is, what? [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5157.339999999999s)]
*  Here's the thing. What? [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5159.099999999999s)]
*  My, first of all, kinda catchy. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5160.74s)]
*  Well, that's the problem with it. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5162.62s)]
*  That's the problem is like, the guy from production, [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5164.0599999999995s)]
*  like he's never lost a step. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5167.5s)]
*  He can make a beat, he can, like he's so talented. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5169.099999999999s)]
*  He's a genius. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5172.299999999999s)]
*  He's a talented producer, man. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5173.139999999999s)]
*  I do think it's like when, first of all, [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5175.1s)]
*  I think people are kind of done asking him questions [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5178.620000000001s)]
*  because most of the shit he puts out is like self-release [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5180.3s)]
*  kind of commentary or thoughts. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5182.580000000001s)]
*  Cause he's saying just fucking, you know. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5184.9800000000005s)]
*  This is the craziest thing I've ever seen. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5187.580000000001s)]
*  But there is a thing where that song is like, [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5190.14s)]
*  what are you doing, dude? [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5193.34s)]
*  Like, what are you doing for real? [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5194.780000000001s)]
*  It's the ultimate pushing back. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5196.5s)]
*  Yeah, I guess. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5197.780000000001s)]
*  But there is like, like I think I have a pretty, [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5199.14s)]
*  you know, let things go kind of vibe to me. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5203.54s)]
*  Obviously. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5206.62s)]
*  Yeah, right? [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5207.46s)]
*  Your fucking show. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5208.3s)]
*  Yeah, I don't. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5209.139999999999s)]
*  Your show's ridiculous. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5209.98s)]
*  It's a ridiculous show. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5210.8s)]
*  And I've always been like, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5211.639999999999s)]
*  yeah, say whatever you're gonna say. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5212.48s)]
*  But I do think like making a catchy song about that, [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5213.5s)]
*  I'm like, what are you doing, man? [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5216.9s)]
*  Like you're just getting, at a minimum, [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5218.3s)]
*  you're just gonna get more people [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5220.0599999999995s)]
*  that think it's cool to say, I'll hit one. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5222.26s)]
*  Like that's at the minimum. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5224.66s)]
*  Well, I think that's part of the program. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5226.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5228.74s)]
*  I think it's part of what he's trying to do. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5229.58s)]
*  But I mean, is that cool to do? [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5230.82s)]
*  I guess if you're like, well, it's fun to troll the masses [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5233.66s)]
*  and get them to do that, okay. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5235.74s)]
*  But what I'm saying is that like at a minimum, [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5237.38s)]
*  you're gonna get less educated people to go like, [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5239.86s)]
*  this is a fun thing to say. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5243.7s)]
*  And you're like, I mean, is that good? [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5245.0199999999995s)]
*  You really want people just walking around [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5247.58s)]
*  being like, you know, it's tight, man. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5250.42s)]
*  How Hitler's like that. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5251.66s)]
*  Fucking insane. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5253.66s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5254.74s)]
*  It is crazy. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5255.74s)]
*  But it's also kind of a sign of the times. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5257.0199999999995s)]
*  I guess. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5259.0199999999995s)]
*  This is the chaotic world we're living in. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5260.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5263.1s)]
*  And it's like, okay, this is this kind of highlights [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5263.94s)]
*  the benefits. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5267.54s)]
*  I mean, I wanna say this like carefully [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5269.38s)]
*  because I don't wanna think any, [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5271.38s)]
*  I wanna say real clearly, [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5272.94s)]
*  I do not support people saying that. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5274.5s)]
*  I don't think it's a good thing to say. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5276.66s)]
*  No. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5278.1s)]
*  I don't say it. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5278.94s)]
*  I certainly don't think, [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5279.78s)]
*  I don't think any racism is good. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5281.3s)]
*  I don't think anti-Semitism is good. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5285.58s)]
*  I don't think anti-Christianity is good. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5287.86s)]
*  I don't think Asian hate is good. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5291.86s)]
*  I don't think anything is good. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5293.74s)]
*  But there's a benefit to just letting people talk. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5295.179999999999s)]
*  Like let people say whatever the fuck they wanna say, [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5299.38s)]
*  even if it sucks. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5301.7s)]
*  This is the benefit of Twitter. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5302.94s)]
*  But this is also the bad part. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5305.58s)]
*  It's like the fucking song is so many millions of hits [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5307.259999999999s)]
*  on Twitter. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5310.38s)]
*  It's been banned from every platform. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5311.219999999999s)]
*  But is it good to ban things from platforms [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5313.139999999999s)]
*  or is it better to let it be out there [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5316.02s)]
*  and let people talk about it? [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5319.18s)]
*  Because if you ban it, [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5320.540000000001s)]
*  then people wanna hear it more. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5321.780000000001s)]
*  That's true. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5323.34s)]
*  And then it becomes more popular [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5324.18s)]
*  and then it kind of supports what he says, [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5325.38s)]
*  which is that there's this concerted effort [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5328.06s)]
*  if you talk about Jewish people [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5330.660000000001s)]
*  that they're gonna remove you from everything, [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5332.820000000001s)]
*  remove you from banking, [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5334.46s)]
*  which is what he's saying, they run everything. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5336.14s)]
*  So if they didn't, [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5337.9800000000005s)]
*  like if it was just, [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5339.38s)]

*  You know what I mean? [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5345.1s)]
*  If there's certain people that you're allowed to pick on [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5346.82s)]

*  But how does it end? [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5360.98s)]
*  This is the question. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5362.259999999999s)]
*  When I was watching that song, [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5363.099999999999s)]
*  first of all, I was by myself. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5365.299999999999s)]
*  When I first saw the song, I was like, what is this? [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5366.82s)]
*  Like no way. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5369.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, no. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5370.46s)]

*  And I'm watching it on my phone, [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5373.339999999999s)]
*  and I'm like yo. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5374.58s)]
*  And then my first thought was, how does this end? [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5376.26s)]
*  Because this ends. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5379.74s)]
*  This is gonna end. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5381.26s)]
*  There's gonna come a time where they're gonna realize, [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5382.46s)]
*  this is a problem. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5384.66s)]
*  So how does it end? [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5386.26s)]
*  Does it end in assassination? [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5387.1s)]
*  Does it end in financial ruin? [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5388.74s)]
*  I don't know what his financial situation is. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5393.3s)]
*  I know that there's been all these, [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5394.98s)]
*  over the last five years, [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5397.22s)]
*  there's been times where his net worth has been reported [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5399.54s)]
*  such a crazy amount. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5403.42s)]
*  And then I remember funds were frozen, [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5404.700000000001s)]
*  and he was like, I don't have anything. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5407.22s)]

*  They're very smart about the diamonds, [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5563.34s)]

*  You know what's fucking crazy in jewelry? [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5566.900000000001s)]

*  $50,000 or something. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5604.66s)]
*  I was like, oh wow. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5605.82s)]

*  I was like, I don't know. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5607.78s)]
*  And then like a month or two later, [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5609.0599999999995s)]
*  he sent me the same thing. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5615.66s)]
*  He's like, I'm trying to move this now. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5616.94s)]
*  Do you want it for like 20? [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5619.82s)]
*  What? [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5621.5s)]
*  And I was like, I was like, it's 20? [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5622.34s)]
*  He's like, yeah, I'm just trying to move it now. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5625.139999999999s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5627.66s)]
*  What do you owe on it? [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5628.58s)]
*  What's it really cost? [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5630.86s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5631.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5632.94s)]
*  And so you kind of go like, wait a minute. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5633.78s)]
*  So I was gonna pay $30,000 more for it? [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5634.9s)]
*  That would just go to you. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5639.299999999999s)]
*  That's so gross, right? [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5640.46s)]
*  It is gross. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5641.62s)]
*  I would never trust that guy again. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5642.46s)]
*  It just really turned me off, man. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5643.299999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, it's really kooky. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5644.82s)]
*  Fake diamonds that are real diamonds. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5647.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5649.099999999999s)]
*  Girls don't want them. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5649.94s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5650.78s)]
*  I was reading this whole thing [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5651.62s)]
*  about the demand and supply for lab-created diamonds [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5652.46s)]
*  that are absolutely diamonds. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5656.259999999999s)]
*  They're not fake diamonds. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5659.379999999999s)]
*  It's a real diamond, [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5660.98s)]
*  but it's not a diamond that's pulled out of the ground [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5662.62s)]
*  by slaves. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5665.3s)]
*  It's just lab-generated. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5666.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's not like a blood diamond. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5667.86s)]
*  So like, well. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5669.46s)]
*  And girls are like, I don't want that shit. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5670.5s)]
*  I don't want it. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5671.34s)]
*  It's not real. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5672.7s)]
*  Oh no, it's not real. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5673.86s)]
*  I want someone to suffer first. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5675.9s)]
*  Well, it's not that. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5677.58s)]
*  What it is is the same thing as not wanting a fake Rolex, [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5678.5s)]
*  even though it's like physically the exact same thing [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5681.38s)]
*  as a Rolex. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5684.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5685.46s)]
*  But that's at least a brand. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5686.3s)]
*  Like if you're a person who loves engineering [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5688.099999999999s)]
*  and craftsmanship. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5690.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5691.38s)]
*  Like I don't want someone to rip off someone's work. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5693.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5696.66s)]
*  Like that's art. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5697.5s)]
*  Like your watch, that's a piece of art. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5698.34s)]
*  It's a piece of art. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5701.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5702.02s)]
*  So that makes sense. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5702.860000000001s)]
*  You wouldn't want a fake piece of art, [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5703.7s)]
*  but a diamond is just, [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5705.34s)]
*  it's just elements compressed over time. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5707.9800000000005s)]
*  They figured out how to do that [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5711.3s)]
*  where they make perfect diamonds. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5712.34s)]
*  Fraction of the cost, I'm assuming, right? [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5715.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, but the demand is super low. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5716.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Wow. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5719.18s)]
*  99% less. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5720.46s)]
*  99? [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5723.42s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5724.5s)]
*  Oh yeah, in some cases. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5726.1s)]
*  Especially the big ones. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5728.1s)]
*  Yeah, I was gonna say, you get like a three carat diamond. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5729.42s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5732.38s)]
*  Little ladies don't want them. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5733.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5734.82s)]
*  I mean, I've never been a white. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5735.9400000000005s)]
*  It's so crazy. I don't know. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5737.74s)]
*  That's one of the things. I'll feel cheap. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5738.9400000000005s)]
*  That I feel so. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5740.86s)]
*  Do you think I'm cheap? [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5742.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5743.86s)]
*  They don't want that shit, dude. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5744.9800000000005s)]
*  She finds out that what you got her [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5746.78s)]
*  is like the shittier version. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5748.94s)]
*  The lab created, but it's not even shittier. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5751.46s)]
*  Right, no. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5753.299999999999s)]
*  It's like lab created diamonds are actual diamonds. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5754.139999999999s)]
*  It's literal alchemy. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5757.139999999999s)]
*  Remember like in the old days, [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5758.82s)]
*  like they were trying to figure out a way to use [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5761.219999999999s)]
*  all these chemicals to make gold? [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5763.66s)]
*  Those were the alchemists of war. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5765.5s)]
*  Kings would spend insane amounts of money on these alchemists [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5767.0199999999995s)]
*  to try to get these alchemists to figure out, [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5770.54s)]
*  man, you've got, I think I can make gold for you, sire. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5772.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5775.62s)]
*  I need a laboratory. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5776.46s)]
*  And these dudes are sniffing fucking mercury all day [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5777.9s)]
*  and dying young. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5780.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5781.98s)]
*  It's the craziest thing to spend on. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5783.82s)]
*  But imagine if the lady's like, [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5786.86s)]

*  I don't want it. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5790.42s)]

*  to rock something that they're so proud of [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5815.82s)]
*  that if they go to get it assessed, [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5818.9800000000005s)]
*  it has to happen all the time. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5821.62s)]

*  Chad Ocho-Sinko, the football player, [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5896.9s)]

*  He was like, yeah, I wear fakes. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5901.82s)]
*  Especially because if I'm, [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5905.419999999999s)]
*  whether it was on the field or going out, [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5907.099999999999s)]

*  You know, he's like, I go out, I wear the fake one. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5910.58s)]

*  A lot of money. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5914.179999999999s)]
*  He was also always very on top of not overspending. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5915.0199999999995s)]
*  Very smart dude. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5918.379999999999s)]

*  For everything except fighting. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5920.179999999999s)]
*  He has this very bizarre idea. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5922.5s)]
*  Like him and Shannon Sharp argue all the time. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5925.38s)]
*  This bizarre idea that he could like fight MMA guys [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5927.3s)]
*  and beat them. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5930.3s)]
*  Oh, that's crazy. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5931.14s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5931.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, it's the reason why he was such a great athlete. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5932.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5935.14s)]
*  Confidence. Crazy confidence. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5935.9800000000005s)]
*  It's this unstoppable belief in yourself, [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5936.82s)]
*  which, listen, he's such a great athlete [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5938.860000000001s)]
*  that if he did compete in MMA, [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5941.7s)]
*  he probably would be a world champion [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5943.78s)]
*  because he's got that, [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5945.900000000001s)]
*  like if Michael Jordan decided he was gonna, [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5947.02s)]
*  if MMA existed when Michael Jordan was alive, [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5949.42s)]
*  he'd probably be the light heavyweight champion [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5952.42s)]
*  of the world. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5953.9400000000005s)]
*  He'd probably figure out a way to fuck everybody else up. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5954.78s)]
*  And also like this drive, this championship mindset. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5957.46s)]
*  These are just rare humans that choose to focus on [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5961.0199999999995s)]
*  football or soccer or basketball or whatever it is. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5964.54s)]
*  The thing they get obsessed with. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5968.5s)]
*  But if they put the same amount of energy [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5969.74s)]
*  from the same amount, an early enough age, [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5971.7s)]
*  there's certain barriers that cannot be overcome [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5975.3s)]
*  and one of them is physical maturity. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5978.0599999999995s)]
*  Once you're 36 years old, [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5980.66s)]
*  if you start boxing at 36 years old, [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5982.78s)]
*  I don't care what, you're not gonna be a world champion. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5984.78s)]
*  It's too hard. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5987.0599999999995s)]
*  It's too hard to like. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5987.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5988.74s)]
*  It's the way you saw with like Francis Ngannou [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5989.58s)]
*  when he fought Anthony Joshua. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5991.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5992.54s)]
*  That's the difference. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5993.5s)]
*  You can't just jump on in and fight [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5994.78s)]
*  like an Olympic gold medalist [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5997.259999999999s)]
*  who's like been doing it his whole life. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=5998.86s)]
*  He's gonna do things to you. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6000.5s)]
*  You're not gonna know what he's doing [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6002.099999999999s)]
*  and he's gonna crack you. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6003.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6004.5s)]
*  It's just, but the reason why he thinks that, [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6005.34s)]
*  like Ocho Senko thinks that [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6008.74s)]
*  is because he was a fucking monster athlete. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6011.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6013.9s)]
*  He knows how hard he works. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6014.74s)]
*  He knows how gifted he is. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6016.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6017.98s)]
*  But he just thinks, but if you put him in there with a guy, [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6018.82s)]
*  like a Drekas Duplassi or something like that, [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6022.0199999999995s)]
*  like he gets fucking mauled. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6024.0599999999995s)]
*  No, he's thinking yeah, [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6026.5s)]
*  because he was a fucking precision route runner. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6027.459999999999s)]
*  Like really. Great. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6029.78s)]
*  When someone's mounting you, [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6030.94s)]

*  Like it doesn't matter. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6035.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6036.62s)]
*  You don't know how to block him. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6037.459999999999s)]

*  Margarita and Philip, they play in tournaments. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6304.2s)]
*  So is Bruce Buffer. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6305.84s)]
*  Bruce Buffer played in the World Series of Poker. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6306.92s)]
*  I never got into poker. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6309.0s)]
*  And I remember when I was working in post-production, [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6310.76s)]
*  like in the early 2000s. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6313.4s)]
*  It was starting to get more and more, [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6315.64s)]
*  like now it's I think immensely popular. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6317.5199999999995s)]
*  But there was like an uptick [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6319.12s)]
*  when they started to like televise it. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6320.6s)]
*  You know what it was? [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6322.2s)]
*  You know what made it uptick? [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6323.04s)]
*  No. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6323.96s)]
*  You could see the cards. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6324.8s)]
*  When at home. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6326.0s)]
*  You know who's got what. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6327.24s)]
*  You know who's got what. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6328.32s)]
*  Right. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6329.16s)]
*  And he's watching it play out. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6330.96s)]
*  That's a huge element. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6331.96s)]
*  That's true. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6334.08s)]
*  That's on home. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6334.92s)]
*  Because Anthony Giordano, my friend from the UFC, [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6335.74s)]
*  who he does all the UFC direction. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6337.96s)]
*  He's done my comedy specials too. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6341.32s)]
*  He explained it to me. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6343.28s)]
*  He's like the moment you can see those cards, [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6344.2s)]
*  that changed the game. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6346.28s)]
*  Because now it made it exciting for people to watch. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6347.12s)]
*  Because you're watching people play poker. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6348.76s)]
*  You don't know what anybody's hand is until the end. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6350.48s)]
*  This is stupid. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6352.52s)]
*  But if this is like you got a camera. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6353.68s)]
*  So like as they fan open their cards, [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6355.64s)]
*  there's a camera under the table. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6358.12s)]
*  And it shows you what everybody's got. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6360.52s)]
*  Like ooh. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6362.0s)]
*  That's more exciting. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6362.84s)]
*  That makes a lot of sense. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6363.68s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6365.2s)]
*  It's way more fun. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6366.04s)]
*  Dude, I don't even know how to play poker. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6366.96s)]
*  And I would accept invites. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6368.88s)]
*  To some poker games. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6370.72s)]
*  And what happens is, [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6372.64s)]
*  you start playing with like how you think to play. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6374.4400000000005s)]
*  And people start, when they don't know you, [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6377.64s)]
*  they're like this guy, [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6379.04s)]
*  he's either fucking really ballsy and good. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6380.360000000001s)]
*  Or he's a retard. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6383.0s)]
*  And that's what would happen to me is like [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6386.320000000001s)]
*  couple games in, [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6388.0s)]
*  people were like okay. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6389.0s)]
*  Yeah, this guy. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6390.72s)]
*  And then pretty soon they're like do you play poker? [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6392.12s)]
*  And I was like I'm not really sure what we're doing here. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6394.08s)]
*  They're like get the fuck out of here man. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6396.08s)]
*  Well they also want to rob you. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6399.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6400.92s)]
*  That's a big thing too. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6401.76s)]
*  Because you're a big fish. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6402.6s)]
*  Well I wasn't at all then. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6403.72s)]
*  At the dawn. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6405.64s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6406.48s)]
*  I was just like going with people from work. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6407.3s)]
*  I was just like doing it socially. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6410.16s)]
*  That's gotta be a thing where a lot of people [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6411.4s)]
*  that are really wealthy that get into gambling. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6414.12s)]
*  Oh, be a target? [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6416.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6417.96s)]
*  Well that's a big thing with pool players too. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6419.6s)]
*  Is occasionally poker players. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6422.2s)]
*  Because poker players, [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6425.8s)]
*  a lot of them they gamble on a bunch of different stuff. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6427.2s)]
*  A lot of them are just gambling addicts. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6429.6s)]
*  Totally. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6431.4800000000005s)]
*  And so there was always a bunch of poker players [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6432.320000000001s)]
*  that would play pool. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6434.56s)]
*  And they were kind of okay at pool. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6435.84s)]
*  But they would get insane spots. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6437.72s)]
*  Like say if, [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6440.6s)]
*  like I knew this guy that was playing one pocket [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6442.0s)]
*  for like $100,000 a set. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6444.42s)]
*  And one pocket is a weird game where, [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6447.84s)]
*  a pool table has six pockets. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6450.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6452.400000000001s)]
*  And so like if we were playing one pocket, [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6453.24s)]
*  you would have this pocket on the right, [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6456.12s)]
*  I'd have this pocket on the left. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6457.76s)]
*  And there's 15 balls. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6459.28s)]
*  And so all I have to do is make eight balls [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6460.76s)]
*  into my hole and I win the game. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6465.56s)]
*  Okay. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6467.32s)]
*  Normally. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6468.16s)]
*  But if you don't know how to play, [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6469.0s)]
*  and I'm trying to sucker you into playing me, [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6471.56s)]
*  I go okay listen. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6473.28s)]
*  I will spot you on 15 ball game. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6475.48s)]
*  I'll spot you 13 balls. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6478.2s)]
*  13. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6480.5199999999995s)]
*  13 balls. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6481.339999999999s)]
*  You just have to get two. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6482.179999999999s)]
*  We're gonna play for big money. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6483.0s)]
*  We're gonna play for big money. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6484.679999999999s)]
*  We're gonna play for a race to five for $100,000. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6486.36s)]
*  So that means whoever, [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6491.08s)]
*  and a game of one pocket takes a long time. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6491.919999999999s)]
*  It's not like a game of nine ball. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6494.5199999999995s)]
*  Game of nine ball, [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6495.919999999999s)]
*  you could be done in two minutes. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6496.74s)]
*  You just run the rack. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6498.78s)]
*  Like a good player. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6500.32s)]
*  Because anywhere you can go. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6501.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6502.5199999999995s)]
*  But in this case you have to go [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6503.36s)]
*  one to nine. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6504.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6505.8s)]
*  One pocket. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6506.639999999999s)]
*  And you can't leave a shot. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6507.48s)]
*  Because if you're playing a good player, [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6509.08s)]
*  so like if you were playing, [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6510.96s)]
*  okay me, let's say me. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6514.08s)]
*  Because I'm like what's called a B player. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6515.76s)]
*  Like I can't beat pros, [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6519.12s)]
*  but compared to regular people, [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6520.58s)]
*  oh my God. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6522.12s)]
*  How do you play so good? [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6522.96s)]
*  Regular people don't know how to play. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6526.16s)]
*  That's why it is. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6527.28s)]
*  But if I played like a pro, [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6528.8s)]
*  like if I played like my friend Fator Ghorst, [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6531.0s)]
*  who's like world champion. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6534.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6536.32s)]
*  Like I would probably need like out of 15 balls, [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6537.16s)]
*  I'd probably need 11 balls to have a chance. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6541.56s)]
*  And even then I'm probably getting robbed. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6545.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6546.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6547.76s)]
*  Because he's just gonna. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6548.58s)]
*  He's gonna figure out a way to never leave me a shot. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6549.42s)]
*  And then he's gonna calculate when he has a shot, [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6551.44s)]
*  can he open up the stack, [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6555.36s)]
*  and then run all the other balls. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6557.12s)]
*  Because you don't break like you break with eight ball, [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6558.52s)]
*  when you break with one pocket, [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6560.919999999999s)]
*  it's a very calculated game. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6561.759999999999s)]
*  And it's a big gambling game. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6563.28s)]
*  The most money gets spent on. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6564.48s)]
*  Like I was just watching online the other day a game, [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6566.639999999999s)]
*  they were playing it for $240,000. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6568.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6571.96s)]
*  It was a match for $240,000. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6572.799999999999s)]
*  I think it was a three day match. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6575.16s)]
*  I gotta watch one of these. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6577.04s)]
*  The pressure's insane. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6579.12s)]
*  But this guy, Justin Bergman, [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6580.679999999999s)]
*  who's like one of the best players in the world, [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6582.599999999999s)]
*  was playing this guy and he gave him a crazy spot. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6584.32s)]
*  I think it was, [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6586.5199999999995s)]
*  I think it was, [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6588.4s)]
*  it might have been like, [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6590.04s)]
*  it was something crazy like 10-6 or something like that. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6593.04s)]
*  Where he had to make 10 balls, [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6595.88s)]
*  the other guy had to make six balls. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6597.92s)]
*  And the guy was a good player too. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6599.5599999999995s)]
*  And so, if you're, [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6600.839999999999s)]
*  so this is like, it's more like chess almost, [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6602.28s)]
*  it feels like, right? [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6604.4s)]
*  Because you're like, they're calculating like. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6605.24s)]
*  You have to risk reward. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6606.96s)]
*  Because like say you might have a long spot in your hole, [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6608.36s)]
*  and if you make it, [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6611.28s)]
*  you have all these balls and you can run out the set, [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6613.0s)]
*  or you can run out the game. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6615.679999999999s)]
*  But if you miss, you're selling out, [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6617.28s)]
*  and this guy only has to make six balls, [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6618.96s)]
*  and he might be able to make six balls. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6620.5199999999995s)]
*  Because we're all like. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6621.719999999999s)]
*  And it's any six. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6622.5599999999995s)]
*  Exactly, any six. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6623.38s)]
*  Wow. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6624.219999999999s)]
*  It's just, any ball just has to be in your hole, [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6625.04s)]
*  in any order. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6627.28s)]
*  It's not a thing, [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6628.24s)]
*  it's not like a rotation game, [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6629.84s)]
*  like one through nine, [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6631.12s)]
*  or eight ball where you're like, [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6631.96s)]
*  I got stripes, you got solids. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6633.08s)]
*  It's just, anything goes. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6634.5199999999995s)]

*  Yeah, that's a lot of football, dude. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6800.320000000001s)]
*  Well, there's been a lot of scandals with the NBA, right? [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6801.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, yeah, the, the. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6804.64s)]
*  Referees, shaving points. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6806.320000000001s)]
*  Donahay, I think this is his name. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6807.68s)]
*  That was nuts. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6809.200000000001s)]
*  There's gotta be a lot of those dirt bags out there. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6810.4800000000005s)]
*  Which totally makes sense. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6812.52s)]
*  And it's so funny too, [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6814.04s)]
*  because the NBA, there's probably like, [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6815.12s)]
*  in football, there's this thing that happens [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6817.64s)]
*  where like every single down, you could call holding [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6819.4s)]
*  if you wanted to. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6822.92s)]
*  Holding just happens in every play, right? [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6823.76s)]
*  Every play. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6826.5199999999995s)]
*  But what they tend to call are egregious holds. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6827.36s)]
*  Meaning that the guy who's the defender is going past you [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6830.88s)]
*  and you see the offensive guy's arm extended, [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6834.64s)]
*  pulling the jersey. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6837.48s)]
*  They're like, I would call that. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6838.84s)]
*  Basketball, it is so ticky tack [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6840.48s)]
*  what can be called and what can be ignored [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6844.36s)]
*  and what is ignored and what is called. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6846.84s)]
*  And it's just like ref to ref. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6848.4s)]
*  Like there's these clear palming, traveling charges. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6850.44s)]
*  Like you see it sometimes, you're like, what was that? [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6855.679999999999s)]
*  Like fingertips like graze the guy's arm [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6857.799999999999s)]
*  and they fucking call the foul. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6861.5199999999995s)]
*  And then somebody gets hacked. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6863.4s)]
*  No foul, right? [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6865.4s)]
*  And it's just, you kind of go, well, [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6866.599999999999s)]
*  that's just like in the moment of the game. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6868.16s)]
*  And like, if that guy wants to be dirty, [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6870.36s)]
*  like the one was. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6872.64s)]
*  You can make some money. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6874.88s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6875.84s)]
*  Yeah, and if you got, [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6876.92s)]
*  you're working for the mob or something like that, [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6877.76s)]
*  like this is your job. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6879.400000000001s)]
*  Your job is to shave points. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6880.4400000000005s)]
*  Your job is to make sure that this, [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6881.88s)]
*  these guys don't score as much. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6883.6s)]
*  They just keep calling the fouls on the other guys, [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6885.240000000001s)]
*  sending you to the foul line and God, keep that spread open. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6887.76s)]
*  It's really gross, man. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6891.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6893.160000000001s)]
*  There's a real problem with it with MMA too. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6894.0s)]
*  Is there really? [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6895.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6896.52s)]
*  There's a real problem with MMA with, [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6897.34s)]
*  here's the problem with MMA gambling. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6900.4800000000005s)]
*  It's like, you're just doing incompetent judging. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6902.8s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6904.48s)]
*  Is it incompetent or is it? [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6905.32s)]
*  Dirty. Dirty. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6907.04s)]
*  With boxing too. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6907.88s)]
*  We've never seen anything. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6909.28s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6910.84s)]
*  Because like even the lay person [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6911.679999999999s)]
*  can watch someone beat the shit out of somebody [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6914.32s)]
*  and be like, this guy's fucking whooping this guy's ass. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6917.08s)]
*  And then the decision go the other way [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6919.76s)]
*  and you're like, what happened? [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6921.12s)]
*  There's been a few decisions like that. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6922.5199999999995s)]
*  There was one lady in Vegas [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6924.5599999999995s)]
*  and she got barred from ever referee or judging fights again. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6926.08s)]
*  So. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6929.76s)]
*  There was a few fights that she was involved with [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6930.599999999999s)]
*  and everybody was like, what the fuck? [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6933.04s)]
*  And she was the common denominator. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6934.04s)]
*  I don't know if she's ever been charged. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6936.36s)]
*  I don't want to mention her name. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6938.16s)]
*  But I know that there was like a real issue. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6939.96s)]
*  It was a real issue with world title fights [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6942.5599999999995s)]
*  where people were like, how the fuck is this? [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6945.16s)]
*  Because if, say if like you're, [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6947.96s)]
*  say it's Canelo Alvarez is fighting someone [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6951.88s)]
*  that you know he's gonna win. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6954.5199999999995s)]
*  You know he's gonna be. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6955.96s)]
*  But you can place a prop bet on it being a split decision. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6956.88s)]
*  Or a majority decision. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6963.12s)]
*  All you have to do is get one person to say it's a draw. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6964.5199999999995s)]
*  And that's it. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6967.599999999999s)]
*  And like, look, he's gonna win. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6968.44s)]
*  He's gonna win. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6969.68s)]
*  He's gonna win either way. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6970.5199999999995s)]
*  But if I want to place a shit ton of money [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6971.92s)]
*  on this one thing, some dirty judge could score a draw. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6976.2s)]
*  And you just have to convince that dirty judge. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6982.72s)]
*  Like just listen, doesn't matter. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6985.2s)]
*  You're not affecting this guy's career. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6986.48s)]
*  He's gonna get the win. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6988.5599999999995s)]
*  No one's gonna remember. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6989.599999999999s)]
*  Just make it a majority decision. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6991.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6994.0s)]
*  And you just gotta justify why you thought, [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6995.08s)]
*  I'm a big fan of defense. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6996.84s)]
*  I think the other guy just like, [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=6998.799999999999s)]
*  we blocked a lot of punches. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7000.2s)]
*  I thought it was great. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7001.16s)]
*  It's really, it's. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7002.719999999999s)]
*  There's so many I feel like in combat sports [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7005.12s)]
*  where the judging is. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7008.16s)]
*  Because it's so subjective. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7009.0s)]
*  But it's just for a fighter, [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7010.24s)]
*  the crazy thing is you lose half your purse. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7012.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7015.04s)]
*  Because like you might get 100,000 to fight [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7015.88s)]
*  and then 100,000 dollars to win. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7019.04s)]
*  And so if they hit you with a bullshit decision, [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7022.0s)]
*  you lost 100 grand. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7023.639999999999s)]
*  Because some hometown decision or some corruption. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7025.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7029.88s)]
*  It's really unique that you have a sport [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7030.72s)]
*  when you think about it where there's a subjective winner. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7033.8s)]
*  Right, it's not like football. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7037.24s)]
*  Right, where like there's the score. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7038.639999999999s)]
*  Every time the score, yeah. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7039.48s)]
*  Basketball, ball goes in the net, score. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7040.96s)]
*  You could shave point, you could bullshit. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7043.72s)]
*  But if you're playing Michael Jordan, [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7046.0s)]
*  he's gonna score on you. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7047.5199999999995s)]
*  Like how are you gonna stop him? [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7049.5199999999995s)]
*  You're not gonna stop him, right? [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7051.68s)]
*  So like the numbers he puts up are the numbers he puts up. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7052.52s)]
*  But in boxing and in MMA, [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7055.16s)]
*  like remember when Roy Jones lost in the Olympics? [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7056.96s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7059.52s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7060.36s)]
*  He lost the Olympics in Korea. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7061.2s)]
*  And he fucked that dude up. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7063.08s)]
*  He beat that dude from pillar to post. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7064.84s)]
*  100%. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7067.56s)]
*  It was nationalism. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7069.52s)]
*  It was like it was in Korea. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7070.8s)]
*  Like Koreans are very proud. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7072.36s)]
*  And they're like he won. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7073.56s)]
*  Like what? [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7074.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7075.28s)]
*  Roy Jones Jr. in his prime in the Olympics, [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7076.12s)]
*  I mean not even in his prime yet. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7079.16s)]
*  He fucked that guy up. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7081.88s)]
*  Fucked that guy up. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7082.72s)]
*  And you know, there's been a few decisions like that [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7083.56s)]
*  in boxing where you're like how is this? [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7085.2s)]
*  What was the one, [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7087.56s)]
*  because I watched a video on this, [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7088.400000000001s)]
*  I think recently too where I was like, [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7090.12s)]
*  oh what was the explanation where it was Kennedy, Tim, [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7091.72s)]
*  right, is that his name, the fighter? [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7096.24s)]
*  Tim Kennedy? [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7098.12s)]
*  Right, is that his name? [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7099.08s)]
*  Sure. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7099.92s)]
*  Fighting the Cuban guy? [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7100.74s)]
*  Yo, Romero. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7102.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7103.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7104.0s)]
*  That was a really. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7104.84s)]
*  That was a bad one. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7105.66s)]
*  That was bad. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7106.5s)]
*  That was a bad one, yeah. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7107.32s)]
*  That was a. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7108.16s)]
*  Where like. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7109.0s)]
*  I don't know if that's the referee's fault or whatever, [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7110.32s)]
*  but he didn't get off of his stool. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7112.52s)]
*  So Kennedy, Tim had rocked him real bad [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7113.860000000001s)]
*  at the end of the round, like real bad. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7116.84s)]
*  And then Yoel came, went to his corner, [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7119.0s)]
*  wobbling fucking out of it. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7121.400000000001s)]
*  And at the end of the one minute break [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7123.96s)]
*  that you're supposed to have, [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7125.96s)]
*  sat on the stool. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7126.8s)]
*  It should be, it's over. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7128.360000000001s)]
*  It's over. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7130.16s)]
*  It should be, it's over. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7131.0s)]
*  But he got an additional, [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7131.82s)]
*  I wanna say more than 30 seconds to recover [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7132.76s)]
*  before he got, and then he wound up beating Tim. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7137.0s)]
*  But also psychologically for the guy [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7140.04s)]
*  who was fucking him up, for Tim, [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7141.96s)]
*  it's like no, this fight is over. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7143.679999999999s)]
*  You're fucking me. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7145.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7146.2s)]
*  I'm getting fucked here. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7147.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7147.86s)]
*  And so then your. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7148.7s)]
*  Your brain starts to. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7149.54s)]
*  And then you get out of your fight mindset, [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7150.379999999999s)]
*  which has to be zen. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7152.54s)]
*  Cause he's, you're getting into the injustice mindset. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7154.08s)]
*  Yes. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7156.5599999999995s)]
*  Like why isn't anybody fucking doing anything? [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7157.4s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, yes. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7158.24s)]
*  And there was, that was just like a oversight. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7159.08s)]
*  Yes, it was crazy. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7160.759999999999s)]
*  I don't know who, I don't wanna pass blame. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7162.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7165.879999999999s)]
*  But someone fucked up. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7166.719999999999s)]
*  But it was a crazy one, yeah. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7167.5599999999995s)]
*  In my mind, one minute, get up. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7168.719999999999s)]
*  Are you gonna get up? [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7171.839999999999s)]
*  Fight's over. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7172.759999999999s)]
*  This guy won. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7174.0s)]
*  That's it. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7174.92s)]
*  He retired on his stool. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7175.759999999999s)]
*  Fuck you. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7177.099999999999s)]
*  Fight's over. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7178.12s)]
*  That's what it should have been, in my mind. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7178.96s)]
*  Also, when the fight, when the round does go over [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7180.4s)]
*  one minute and the guy doesn't get up, [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7184.44s)]
*  you put a burden on Kennedy that is just like [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7186.5599999999995s)]
*  totally unfair, totally unfair. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7190.5199999999995s)]
*  Especially when he was rocking him at the end of the round. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7192.96s)]
*  This is like, the more time he gets to recover, [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7195.4s)]
*  there's a reason why in boxing you only get 10 seconds. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7199.16s)]
*  The more time he gets to recover, [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7201.759999999999s)]
*  the more it's possible that he can win, this is not fair. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7203.5199999999995s)]
*  It's supposed to be one minute and that's it. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7206.679999999999s)]
*  If the fight doesn't restart at one minute, [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7209.12s)]
*  he's not ready, it's over. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7210.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7212.12s)]
*  So that's only happened once. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7214.24s)]
*  And unfortunately for Tim, it happened to him. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7215.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that does suck. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7217.8s)]
*  It was a bummer. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7218.679999999999s)]
*  It was a bummer because Yoel Romero went on to, [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7219.759999999999s)]
*  I mean, Yoel was a freak of all freaks, though. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7222.04s)]
*  The guy could recover and he was also like [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7225.24s)]
*  just built like a superhero. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7227.76s)]
*  He looked like a goddamn pit bull. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7230.08s)]
*  He was part of the Cuban athlete program. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7232.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7234.92s)]
*  The fucking traps and the head. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7235.76s)]
*  Everybody who fought him said that like hitting him hurt. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7238.68s)]
*  Hitting him. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7242.08s)]
*  So he was like, he was made out of metal. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7242.92s)]
*  They all said that. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7244.76s)]
*  Everybody said like, like Robert Whitaker, [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7245.6s)]
*  who beat him twice, who was the middleweight champion, [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7247.76s)]
*  he's like every time you hit him, it hurt you. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7250.64s)]
*  Like he's just different. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7253.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7255.2s)]
*  Freaky guy. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7256.04s)]
*  Yeah, so like if Chad Ocho-Shinko [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7257.12s)]
*  thinks he was gonna beat that guy. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7259.36s)]
*  No. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7260.719999999999s)]
*  Like, listen, bro. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7261.5599999999995s)]
*  No. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7262.48s)]
*  Like there's people like you out there [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7263.32s)]
*  that also really know how to fight. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7265.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7267.32s)]
*  You know, like there's like people that have that. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7268.16s)]
*  That's a problem with like really tough guys. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7269.759999999999s)]
*  They think they're the only one like that. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7271.4s)]
*  Like. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7272.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7273.719999999999s)]
*  Ugh. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7274.5599999999995s)]
*  It's like you don't wanna discourage that in a fighter [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7276.88s)]
*  because that's the thing that gets them [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7280.36s)]
*  to a championship level in the first place [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7282.32s)]
*  is this belief that they're just different. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7284.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7286.0s)]
*  They're the chosen one. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7286.84s)]
*  They're destined for this. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7288.639999999999s)]
*  But the wake up call that those guys get [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7290.32s)]
*  when they get knocked unconscious is the craziest thing. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7292.679999999999s)]
*  It's like the reality, like, oh my God, [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7295.92s)]
*  I am the victim now. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7297.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7299.16s)]
*  I am what I have been doing to other people. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7300.0s)]
*  Someone just did to me and now it's over. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7302.2s)]
*  That has to rock you on such a deep level. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7304.599999999999s)]
*  The deepest. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7307.799999999999s)]
*  Well, cause it's also, it fucks with your identity. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7308.639999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7311.8s)]
*  Like who you are. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7312.64s)]
*  Oh yeah, your worth. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7313.4800000000005s)]

*  that the whole world loved. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7568.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7570.32s)]
*  And he probably has a bitch ass friend. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7571.16s)]
*  Yeah, look at you, man. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7572.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7573.92s)]
*  And he's like, Marvin's killing it [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7575.2s)]
*  and you're just a fucking loser. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7576.04s)]
*  Oh. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7577.400000000001s)]
*  Fucking kid. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7578.24s)]
*  What was the, [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7579.92s)]
*  because I always knew that the father, [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7581.56s)]
*  was it like a clear cut homicide one? [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7583.84s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7586.88s)]
*  Yeah, the father just shot him. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7587.72s)]
*  And. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7588.8s)]
*  It was an interesting thing [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7589.62s)]
*  because I think what had happened with Marvin Gaye [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7590.6s)]
*  was Marvin had achieved incredible fame, [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7593.320000000001s)]
*  but he got fucked over in some record deal [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7599.280000000001s)]
*  where he had no money. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7601.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7602.96s)]
*  I think he had like, yeah. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7603.8s)]
*  Like everybody in that era. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7604.64s)]
*  Bro. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7605.96s)]
*  So fucking predatory. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7606.8s)]
*  Bro. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7607.64s)]
*  You wanna talk about predatory. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7608.64s)]
*  The worst. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7609.76s)]
*  Corporations. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7610.6s)]
*  The music business is like the most disgusting. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7611.4400000000005s)]
*  You ever read the thing that Courtney Lover wrote [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7612.72s)]
*  about it, about the music business? [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7614.6s)]
*  A lot of people don't even think she wrote it [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7616.56s)]
*  because it's too good, [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7617.92s)]
*  but it was essentially a breakdown [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7620.16s)]
*  of how bad the music business fucks you. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7621.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7624.52s)]
*  And this is at a time where you actually sold records. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7625.360000000001s)]
*  Tons of them sometimes, yeah. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7627.64s)]
*  Yeah, because now the music business, [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7628.8s)]
*  it's like the mask is off. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7631.24s)]
*  It doesn't provide any value. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7633.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7634.32s)]
*  And they still take 50% of your touring, [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7635.16s)]
*  which is crazy. Of your touring. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7636.12s)]
*  Yeah, 50-50. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7638.32s)]
*  They do 50-50 deals, merch, touring. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7639.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7641.64s)]
*  And then what are they gonna do? [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7642.48s)]
*  What do they provide? [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7643.32s)]
*  They can't even get you on the radio [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7644.16s)]
*  because the radio doesn't exist. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7645.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7646.32s)]
*  Like, you know, that's why people that break through [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7647.16s)]
*  from that model, like Oliver Anthony [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7650.36s)]
*  or Tyler, the creator is a great example, [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7652.32s)]
*  like just makes his own stuff, puts it all in, [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7654.72s)]
*  it doesn't have to be. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7656.64s)]
*  People don't even realize that in that era too, [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7657.8s)]
*  you would, after your tour, [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7659.88s)]
*  after your tour and your hit album, [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7661.72s)]
*  that you'd be in debt. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7665.16s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7666.360000000001s)]
*  To the record companies, so they're like, [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7667.2s)]
*  you gotta do another album. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7668.04s)]
*  Oh yeah, and the record companies, all rich. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7669.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7671.2s)]
*  Everyone's profiting. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7672.04s)]
*  And then also, they want you to subsidize the failures. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7672.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7676.76s)]
*  All these boy bands that they pushed that never made it, [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7677.6s)]
*  all the money that they put into that, [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7679.6s)]
*  that's a part of the accounting. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7680.92s)]
*  So insane. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7682.280000000001s)]
*  And then Hollywood does the same thing. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7683.240000000001s)]
*  They would do the same thing [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7684.68s)]
*  with like how much money a movie made. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7685.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7688.280000000001s)]
*  Like there's been tons of lawsuits [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7689.12s)]
*  that involve that kind of stuff. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7690.599999999999s)]
*  Wait, but where were you with Marvin? [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7692.08s)]
*  You're like, he's broke? [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7694.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so he, if I remember this story correctly, [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7695.96s)]
*  it was so depressing, [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7701.04s)]
*  I didn't even wanna like really get into it, [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7701.88s)]
*  because I think he had become huge superstar [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7703.599999999999s)]
*  and then didn't have any money, [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7707.679999999999s)]
*  which is, it's happened more than once. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7710.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7713.8s)]
*  Like, and I think he might've had to move back in [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7714.639999999999s)]
*  with his parents. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7716.36s)]
*  No. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7717.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's- [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7718.04s)]
*  Really? [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7719.16s)]
*  I think that's the story. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7720.84s)]
*  See if you can find that. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7722.0s)]
*  Oh, I'm looking, I don't know. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7722.84s)]
*  I mean, it says he bought his dad a Cadillac, [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7725.84s)]
*  but this is years later though. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7727.84s)]
*  Right, but the thing is like he might've like bought him [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7729.32s)]
*  money when the money was flowing in. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7731.84s)]
*  And then after a while, [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7733.88s)]
*  that's the other thing that happens with artists. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7736.24s)]
*  Like artists are impulsive, so they spend all their money. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7738.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7740.72s)]
*  And then they don't really, [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7741.56s)]
*  like how many artists get given like a Mercedes Benz [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7742.4s)]
*  by the head of a label and they think like, [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7745.64s)]
*  oh shit, I'm killing it. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7749.24s)]
*  Meanwhile, it's a leased car. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7750.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7751.719999999999s)]
*  And they're just siphoning money out of you. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7752.5599999999995s)]
*  Someone is writing that loss. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7755.679999999999s)]
*  You're just getting fucked. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7757.48s)]
*  You're getting fucked left and right and right and left. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7758.36s)]
*  And all they do is sell art. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7760.679999999999s)]
*  All they do is sell art. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7764.719999999999s)]
*  They don't make any of it [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7766.4s)]
*  and they make more money than anybody. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7767.44s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7769.32s)]
*  People didn't know, [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7770.32s)]
*  cause now if you are into music, whatever, [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7771.16s)]
*  you don't realize how much it was a thing [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7774.44s)]
*  to have music videos, right? [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7776.84s)]
*  That used to be such the biggest thing. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7778.5199999999995s)]
*  And a lot of artists, especially like the young artists, [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7780.88s)]
*  didn't even know that they were paying for the music video. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7783.719999999999s)]
*  So like the label would be like, go shoot your video. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7787.32s)]
*  And they'd be like, cool. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7789.12s)]
*  It's a million dollars. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7790.04s)]
*  And they'd be like, great. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7791.12s)]
*  And then they're like, oh no, you're gonna pay for that. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7792.08s)]
*  But they tell them later, [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7793.92s)]
*  we gotta deduct that million. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7795.2s)]
*  And they're like, wait, what? [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7796.48s)]
*  They're not sophisticated. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7797.48s)]
*  They're not finance majors. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7798.599999999999s)]
*  Which is what we were talking about earlier. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7799.92s)]
*  You should learn that in school. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7801.24s)]
*  No idea that you're like, wait, I pay, [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7802.88s)]
*  I thought you guys are paying for this. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7804.639999999999s)]
*  It's kind of funny that the video, [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7807.160000000001s)]
*  everything is visual. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7810.08s)]
*  Everything's visual now. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7812.360000000001s)]
*  There's so much video that people watch, [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7813.4800000000005s)]
*  but yet music videos kind of went away. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7815.4800000000005s)]
*  I know. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7818.280000000001s)]
*  Except Kanye's. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7819.120000000001s)]
*  Except for, [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7819.96s)]
*  because that one we definitely all saw. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7820.8s)]
*  And the new one looks like you made it for $40. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7823.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7825.64s)]
*  Like it doesn't, [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7826.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, it's like you got a drone [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7827.320000000001s)]
*  and a bunch of people on Hile Hitler. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7828.76s)]
*  And he had like the black light kind of effect. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7830.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7832.6s)]
*  Doesn't seem like that cost a lot of money. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7833.4400000000005s)]
*  No, I don't think that probably cost a lot. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7834.280000000001s)]
*  You can make things now too for so much less. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7836.64s)]
*  Oh, with AI. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7839.08s)]
*  It's so accessible. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7839.92s)]
*  With AI, you don't even have to have [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7841.320000000001s)]
*  the actual people doing it. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7843.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7844.400000000001s)]
*  Which is really crazy. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7845.240000000001s)]
*  Like what you can do now is nuts. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7847.08s)]
*  My daughter was showing me some stuff [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7848.400000000001s)]
*  that you could do with just photographs. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7849.84s)]
*  Where she could take photographs [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7851.72s)]
*  and then she throws them through this filter [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7853.04s)]
*  and then they're dancing around and moving. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7854.6s)]
*  You're like, this is nuts. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7856.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7857.8s)]
*  So all you need is a photograph. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7858.64s)]
*  And especially if you chose to have like effects in it, [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7860.0s)]
*  like some sort of psychedelic fucking weird things [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7864.46s)]
*  where things morph and change. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7868.54s)]
*  It could all be done with AI now. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7870.18s)]
*  That's incredible. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7872.58s)]
*  Easily. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7873.74s)]
*  Well, there's articles out about some studio. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7874.58s)]
*  Maybe it's here in Texas. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7879.02s)]
*  I got the, somebody sent me the link to this [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7882.14s)]
*  that this company wants to, yeah, [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7886.58s)]
*  they wanna start making studio quality movies [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7889.34s)]
*  for 500K AI movies. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7892.46s)]
*  I bet they can make it for cheaper than that. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7895.22s)]
*  But that's, yeah. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7896.9s)]
*  These are, I mean that's. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7899.14s)]
*  They probably have AI write the script, man. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7900.42s)]
*  I mean, if you're thinking about [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7903.5s)]
*  some dumb ass fucking cop movie, [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7904.34s)]
*  some silly bank heist movie. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7908.66s)]
*  You got a hero who's gonna go in [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7911.9s)]
*  and fucking kill the bad guys. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7913.84s)]
*  Fraction of the cost. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7915.3s)]
*  You could write that easy with just take, [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7916.18s)]
*  all AI has to do is like, [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7919.94s)]
*  it's a large language model, right? [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7921.82s)]
*  It almost is searched through Steve McQueen movies [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7923.78s)]
*  and Tom Hardy movies. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7927.7s)]
*  Write me a movie. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7929.259999999999s)]
*  And fucking Guy Ritchie movies. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7930.099999999999s)]
*  Put it together, make me a movie. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7931.74s)]
*  No, it bums me out though. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7933.0199999999995s)]
*  Like I don't wanna watch that movie. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7934.219999999999s)]
*  It should. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7935.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7936.179999999999s)]
*  What is this? [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7937.0s)]
*  This is the company, this is the first piece they made [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7937.84s)]
*  and it shows a little bit of how they made it here. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7939.299999999999s)]
*  The woman with red hair. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7940.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7942.139999999999s)]
*  They still are doing it. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7942.98s)]
*  Oh, so they have actors. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7943.799999999999s)]
*  They have real actors. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7944.639999999999s)]
*  Then they're replaced. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7946.38s)]
*  God damn, like look, it looks so good. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7947.34s)]
*  It looks so good. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7950.9400000000005s)]
*  Like that's not a real person. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7952.3s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7953.620000000001s)]
*  Well, she does. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7954.46s)]
*  It's the uncanny valley. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7955.5s)]
*  It looks a little weird. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7956.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7957.9400000000005s)]
*  But getting better all the time [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7958.780000000001s)]
*  and the only reason why it looks weird [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7960.4800000000005s)]
*  is because it's so well lit. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7962.26s)]
*  Like if you wanted to do it like Sin City style, [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7964.14s)]
*  there's no, like Sin City, [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7967.660000000001s)]
*  if Robert Rodriguez wanted to do Sin City today, [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7968.900000000001s)]
*  the whole thing could be AI. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7971.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7972.740000000001s)]
*  No one would know. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7973.58s)]
*  No. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7974.42s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7975.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7976.08s)]
*  These are all fake people. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7976.900000000001s)]
*  And dude, just a few years ago, [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7978.42s)]
*  you couldn't do hair. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7980.66s)]
*  Hair was weird. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7982.06s)]
*  Right. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7983.1s)]
*  And so were like extremities, right? [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7984.14s)]
*  Fingers, yeah. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7985.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7986.54s)]
*  Now, I mean, just in a short amount of time, [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7987.38s)]
*  it's incredible. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7990.16s)]
*  Why is that, that's so interesting. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7992.14s)]
*  Why are fingers? [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7993.54s)]
*  Like, you know? [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7995.9800000000005s)]
*  It's a good question. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7996.82s)]
*  And well, hair seems like [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7997.64s)]
*  it would take a lot of computing power, right? [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=7999.1s)]
*  Cause you have your- [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8000.9400000000005s)]
*  Strands, single strands moving. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8001.78s)]
*  Like her hair is not moving. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8003.86s)]
*  It's pretty static. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8004.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, but it's, no, it isn't. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8005.9800000000005s)]
*  Go back. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8007.1s)]
*  But it is all moving. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8008.299999999999s)]
*  Not the way it would. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8009.7s)]
*  It would if, yeah, you're right. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8010.86s)]
*  You're right. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8012.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8013.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's moving almost like a little bit of a helmet. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8014.339999999999s)]
*  Like that would be a tell. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8017.58s)]
*  Like it's a little bit of movement, but not enough. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8019.099999999999s)]
*  A little bit of bounce, but not, [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8021.62s)]
*  like it's all spray painted. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8023.379999999999s)]
*  Like as if, if her hair was like sprayed [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8025.099999999999s)]
*  with a shit ton of hairspray, [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8027.759999999999s)]
*  where it couldn't move at all, [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8029.099999999999s)]
*  that would kind of make sense. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8030.339999999999s)]
*  But it's not moving. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8031.58s)]
*  So they all need that scene [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8032.419999999999s)]
*  at the beginning of every of their movies. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8033.24s)]
*  Like. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8034.9s)]
*  Shit. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8035.74s)]
*  At least. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8036.58s)]

*  But I was the winner of the game. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8315.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8319.44s)]

*  the way you interface with reality itself. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8381.5s)]
*  The brain. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8384.48s)]

*  You don't get to be a special person. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8446.42s)]
*  Most people don't get to be a special person. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8448.94s)]
*  And a special fighter [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8451.300000000001s)]

*  That sucks. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8464.86s)]
*  Fucking horrible. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8465.699999999999s)]
*  So imagine if you had a fight, [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8466.539999999999s)]
*  and now you were a big time fighter [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8468.82s)]
*  and you hurt yourself playing basketball with Burt Crusher. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8471.26s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8473.5s)]
*  And then you gotta build yourself back up to fight again, [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8474.34s)]
*  but you kinda know that your left arm [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8476.42s)]
*  is kinda still fucked a little bit. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8478.46s)]

*  Be careful. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8491.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8492.34s)]
*  Don't do that. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8493.18s)]
*  And I, you know, I've had three knee surgeries. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8494.1s)]
*  And I'm having a problem with this left knee [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8497.140000000001s)]
*  that I really hurt. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8499.94s)]

*  And the last time I ski, [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8504.34s)]
*  because I cracked the bone that's at the top of the tibia. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8505.94s)]
*  And then I probably messed up the cartilage [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8511.7s)]
*  and shit in there too. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8513.94s)]
*  But it's still better than most people's knees. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8515.62s)]
*  Like it's better than a regular knee. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8518.14s)]
*  Like people are like, how bad is your knee? [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8519.98s)]
*  Like it's not fucked up, like compared to your knees, [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8522.26s)]
*  like a regular person's knees. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8524.94s)]
*  Yeah, because you. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8526.14s)]
*  But I need my knee to be able to kick 60 miles an hour [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8526.98s)]
*  and do a bag of sand. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8532.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8534.18s)]
*  Like I'm requiring different things [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8535.02s)]
*  from my knees to most people. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8536.5s)]
*  But I know it's not the same. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8538.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8541.7s)]
*  Like, and if you're a fighter and you know you got a bum knee, [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8542.539999999999s)]
*  nobody can tell when you're moving around. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8544.859999999999s)]
*  But you know. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8547.06s)]
*  And you know your hand breaks easier now. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8548.019999999999s)]

*  And you know you got a pinched nerve. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8551.539999999999s)]
*  And you know your lower back gives out sometimes. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8552.98s)]
*  And you know your kidneys kinda hurt [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8555.26s)]
*  because you cut weight for too many years. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8557.74s)]
*  It sounds like you know you shouldn't be fighting. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8559.5s)]
*  And you know your memory's not so good anymore. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8561.1s)]
*  And also you know you can't take a punch anymore. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8564.22s)]
*  Like a lot of guys know that they used to be able [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8566.3s)]
*  to take a great punch, but now you can't get hit. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8568.34s)]
*  So now you're gun shy. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8570.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8571.859999999999s)]
*  Did you see Devin Haney's fight last weekend? [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8572.7s)]
*  No. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8574.980000000001s)]
*  He fought like you know Ryan Garcia fucked him up [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8576.140000000001s)]
*  in the last fight. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8579.380000000001s)]
*  Dropped him a bunch of times. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8580.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8581.42s)]
*  And this fight like it looks like he's done. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8582.26s)]
*  Like he's moving around just like [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8584.1s)]
*  it was just constantly moving. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8585.94s)]
*  Who'd he fight? [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8587.26s)]
*  I forget the gentleman's name. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8589.060000000001s)]
*  But there were rounds where neither one [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8590.740000000002s)]
*  of them landed a punch. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8593.820000000002s)]
*  The whole round? [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8595.66s)]
*  The whole round. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8596.5s)]
*  And Garcia, that's the one where he was, [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8597.34s)]
*  he won the fight but then there was all this bullshit. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8599.34s)]
*  He protested positive for some sort of performance [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8601.18s)]
*  enhancing metabolite at a very low level by the way. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8604.02s)]
*  Like not a level where it would be performance enhancing. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8608.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8612.06s)]
*  So I don't know what happened. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8612.9s)]
*  He says he didn't take anything. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8613.74s)]
*  What ended up happening with the decision [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8615.9s)]
*  or the purse or whatever? [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8618.7s)]
*  It became a no contest. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8619.9s)]
*  Oh it became a no contest. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8621.5s)]
*  Yeah and I think he's also getting sued [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8622.34s)]
*  because you know Devin Haney claimed that he won [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8624.62s)]
*  because he was on steroids and that's a bad look. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8627.82s)]
*  But you could tell that like mind fucked Devin Haney. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8630.34s)]
*  And a lot of people like totally are writing off [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8632.9s)]
*  Devin Haney now which is crazy. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8635.42s)]
*  Because I remember when he beat Cambosa. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8637.82s)]
*  So I was like damn Devin Haney's slick. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8639.98s)]
*  He's so good. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8642.22s)]
*  And now like that guy is just, [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8643.62s)]
*  he was just moving constantly. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8645.98s)]
*  And still very skilled boxer. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8648.22s)]
*  But it just shows you like one devastating loss. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8650.26s)]
*  Can fuck you up. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8654.22s)]
*  Or an undefeated fighter can fuck you up. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8655.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8657.42s)]
*  And some guys they come back and they're fine. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8658.26s)]
*  Garcia for instance, like Gervonta Davis fucked him up. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8660.3s)]
*  Bad. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8664.34s)]
*  He came back and he was fine. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8665.18s)]
*  But then this weekend, that weekend rather, [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8666.02s)]
*  he fought Rolly Romero and Romero dropped him [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8668.06s)]
*  and he lost the decision. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8670.66s)]
*  So they were gonna like set up a big rematch. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8672.18s)]
*  Now nobody wants to see the rematch [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8673.98s)]
*  because they both lost. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8675.18s)]
*  They both lost. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8676.0s)]
*  Well actually Devin didn't lose. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8676.84s)]
*  He won a decision but he lost public credibility [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8678.619999999999s)]
*  because it was a very boring fight. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8682.42s)]
*  Still incredibly skillful boxer. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8684.539999999999s)]
*  World champion boxer. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8686.86s)]
*  Very good boxer. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8689.019999999999s)]
*  But even the commentary like Antonio Tarver was like, [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8690.699999999999s)]
*  I don't like the way he's moving. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8693.859999999999s)]
*  His footwork seems erratic. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8695.5s)]
*  Everything is like he needs to settle down. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8697.3s)]
*  They, Jose Ramirez. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8699.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8701.779999999999s)]
*  But they- [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8702.619999999999s)]
*  So Haney won this fight. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8703.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he won a decision. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8704.859999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8706.3s)]
*  But it was the fans lost. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8707.14s)]
*  And this was this big event in Times Square. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8709.3s)]
*  This is also a big event because [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8712.019999999999s)]
*  I think Turkey Al-Ashik, the guy from Saudi Arabia, [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8715.02s)]
*  his excellency is the guy who's dumping [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8720.22s)]
*  incredible amounts of money into boxing [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8721.98s)]
*  so that he can get these guys to fight each other. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8724.02s)]
*  So he's like, what do you need for the fight? [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8726.26s)]
*  How much to make this fight happen? [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8728.46s)]
*  Like I need $10 million. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8729.9s)]
*  Like done. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8731.3s)]
*  And they're like, what? [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8732.619999999999s)]
*  Like fuck, I should ask for 20. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8733.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8735.06s)]
*  It's that kind of a situation [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8735.9s)]
*  because the Saudis have so much money. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8737.5s)]
*  So Oscar De La Hoya was talking about this [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8739.3s)]
*  and he was saying these guys are spoiled [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8742.62s)]
*  and they're afraid to risk anything. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8745.660000000002s)]
*  Right. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8747.94s)]
*  Because the money's so much, which is so interesting. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8748.78s)]
*  Like you need a guy who's willing to risk it all [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8750.78s)]
*  to really fucking go for it. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8754.220000000001s)]
*  And these guys aren't willing to do that. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8756.54s)]
*  And I think the Devin Haney thing, [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8758.740000000002s)]
*  it's one of those things where you see a guy [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8760.18s)]
*  who is an unbelievably skilled fighter [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8761.980000000001s)]
*  but loses one fight and they're just not the same again. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8764.26s)]
*  Not the same. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8766.7s)]
*  And Gervonta's still- [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8767.54s)]
*  Gervonta's still killing it. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8768.94s)]
*  Killing it. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8769.980000000001s)]
*  But he had that fight with Lamont Roach [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8770.820000000002s)]
*  where it was a draw. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8773.22s)]
*  There was a legit draw. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8775.460000000001s)]
*  And you could even make the argument [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8776.78s)]
*  that Roach won that fight and they're gonna fight again. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8779.1s)]
*  That should be very interesting. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8782.18s)]
*  But I think it's also, for boxers, [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8783.14s)]
*  there's a situation where you can only keep up [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8785.7s)]
*  the RPMs for so long. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8787.74s)]
*  All the greats, there's a certain amount of times [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8789.38s)]
*  that you can keep training. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8792.82s)]
*  A certain amount of times you can keep competing. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8794.02s)]
*  And like we're talking about your arm, [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8795.9s)]
*  you know it's kinda fucked up. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8797.34s)]
*  That happens with them too. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8798.82s)]
*  Like the ankles are bad, something's bad. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8799.94s)]
*  They can't do the same level of output. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8803.179999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's not the same. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8804.38s)]
*  They're not who they used to be. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8805.22s)]
*  They might look the same but they can't do [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8807.099999999999s)]
*  what they could do five years ago, six years ago. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8808.939999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8811.34s)]
*  It's hard. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8813.179999999998s)]
*  It's a hard sport, man. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8814.019999999999s)]
*  But it's also because the glory is so high [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8816.099999999999s)]
*  if you're successful. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8818.699999999999s)]
*  So great. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=8819.9s)]

*  And they're like, fuck. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9064.380000000001s)]
*  I think I'm gonna start doing standup again. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9065.220000000001s)]
*  Like, and they start trying to put together an act, [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9066.900000000001s)]
*  and they wanna show up, [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9068.980000000001s)]
*  and then the club doesn't know who they are anymore. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9069.820000000002s)]
*  Oh, God. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9071.900000000001s)]
*  Oh. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9072.740000000002s)]
*  Give me anxiety. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9073.580000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9074.42s)]
*  Oh. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9075.26s)]
*  Scary. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9076.1s)]
*  It's a scary feeling. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9076.92s)]
*  It's the worst. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9077.76s)]
*  But it's like, these decisions that you make in life, [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9078.62s)]
*  like what are you going to do? [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9081.86s)]
*  Like, what are you going to do with your life? [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9084.18s)]
*  Those are personal decisions. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9086.18s)]
*  Which is why they're like, [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9088.300000000001s)]
*  this whole free will versus determinism thing [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9089.300000000001s)]
*  drives me crazy. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9092.78s)]
*  Because these people that wanna believe [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9094.78s)]
*  there is no such thing as free will, [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9096.26s)]
*  like, yeah, you can do that cute little thing, [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9098.02s)]
*  but you know that free will's real [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9100.24s)]
*  because you know that you decide to get up in the morning. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9101.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9104.060000000001s)]
*  Like, you're telling me Jelly Roll [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9104.900000000001s)]
*  didn't have free will to lose that 200 pounds? [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9106.02s)]
*  No shit. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9109.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9110.900000000001s)]
*  Perfect example. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9111.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9112.560000000001s)]
*  Like, that's hard to do. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9113.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9114.380000000001s)]
*  You're 400 plus pounds, you're fat as fuck, [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9115.220000000001s)]
*  you're drinking and partying every night, [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9118.34s)]
*  and then one day you put your foot down, [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9119.7s)]
*  and that's it. Not doing the shit, yeah. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9121.300000000001s)]
*  That's enough. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9123.5s)]
*  I'm gonna get healthy. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9124.34s)]
*  That's free will. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9125.38s)]
*  Like, you're telling me determinism [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9126.86s)]
*  like forced him into a position at 39 years old [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9129.06s)]
*  where he's all of a sudden gonna decide to lose [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9132.18s)]
*  all this weight and has nothing to do with his free will? [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9134.22s)]
*  That's silly. [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9136.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9137.78s)]
*  Will's a real thing. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9138.619999999999s)]
*  Of course. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9139.44s)]
*  And we all have it, and you can just deny it. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9140.28s)]
*  But it's why, I don't know, [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9142.66s)]
*  anything that you accomplish that's work [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9144.94s)]
*  is through free will. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9148.5s)]
*  It's through making choices, man. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9150.42s)]
*  But then there is also a certain amount of determinism. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9151.94s)]
*  If you grow up in a terribly abusive household, [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9155.66s)]
*  and you're around drug addicts and violence, [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9159.26s)]
*  and then you go and commit that, [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9162.62s)]
*  it's almost like you have no other examples. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9164.34s)]
*  You're- [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9169.42s)]
*  It's true. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9170.26s)]
*  I get that, but you still make a choice. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9171.1s)]
*  You do, but you don't even know what a good choice is [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9173.060000000001s)]
*  because you've never even seen a good choice. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9175.02s)]
*  That's a valuable analysis [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9176.380000000001s)]
*  that you had a horrible modeling, [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9180.3s)]
*  so you're just following a path you think is the only path. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9183.38s)]
*  And some of those guys get involved in athletics. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9187.099999999999s)]
*  Some of those guys get lucky and they become a fighter, [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9189.74s)]
*  or maybe they get lucky and they become a musician, [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9191.74s)]
*  or maybe they get lucky and they become something else, [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9194.259999999998s)]
*  or a comic. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9196.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9196.98s)]
*  Yeah, but it's just the choices that you make in this life [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9197.8s)]
*  are that you don't know if it's the right choice [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9201.74s)]
*  while you're doing it, while you're making that choice. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9205.019999999999s)]
*  Well, I'm about to find out [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9207.259999999998s)]
*  whether making this TV show was the right choice. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9208.22s)]
*  No. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9210.619999999999s)]
*  I'll find out. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9211.46s)]
*  Do you have to piss? [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU&t=9212.42s)]
