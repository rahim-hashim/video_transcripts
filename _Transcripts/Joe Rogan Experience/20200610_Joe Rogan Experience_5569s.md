# Joe Rogan Experience #1489 - Ronnie Coleman
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 10, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi5OlUE3BLc)
*  One, Mr. Coleman.
*  What's going on?
*  Great to meet you, brother.
*  It's a real honor.
*  I mean, you are, when I was like really into bodybuilding and reading the magazines, and
*  I always said that you look like a dude who they invented in a Marvel comic book to kill
*  the Hulk.
*  Like, that's what you looked like when you were in your prime, man.
*  Yeah, I felt like I probably could too, like in those days.
*  I mean, God damn, you were freakishly huge.
*  It was crazy to see.
*  I remember paying attention to bodybuilding from the beginning, like the Franco Colombo
*  and Schwarzenegger days, to what you guys had become when you were in your prime.
*  You just redefined everything.
*  Everything was just so extreme.
*  Yeah, we were pretty tough back in the old days.
*  Everything was hard.
*  The guys I was competing against were real good.
*  I just came out of nowhere because I got into bodybuilding real late.
*  Where I'm from, we didn't have it, and I didn't find out about it until I graduated
*  college, went out to Texas, and started working for the police department.
*  How old were you at the time?
*  I was about 24.
*  So that's when you started bodybuilding.
*  That's when I started.
*  But I had been working out since I was 12, 13.
*  For sports?
*  Yeah, I was on the powerlifting team.
*  Oh, okay.
*  I did powerlifting in high school.
*  So I was on the powerlifting team.
*  Where I'm from, Louisiana, a real small town, a lot of the guys are kind of big like me,
*  kind of strong like me.
*  A lot of people don't understand, but strength is something like a natural gift.
*  You can work on it and get better at it, but you also have to be gifted a little bit.
*  Have to have a nice base.
*  Yeah, you have to have a nice base and you have to have a little talent.
*  I like this guy, I can't remember his name, but he deadlifted 1,100 pounds.
*  Oh, that Game of Thrones guy?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  The Mountain?
*  That's a gift.
*  That's talent.
*  Yeah.
*  He's gifted.
*  Everybody can do that.
*  I did 800 for a couple of reps, but I don't think I can do 1,100.
*  That's a lot of weight.
*  That's a lot of weight.
*  He's an enormous human being, though.
*  That guy, that's a Viking right there.
*  You have to have a lot of weight to be able to pull a lot of weight like that, too.
*  In your career, you were known for lifting large amounts of weight, too.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Like I was saying, I started powerlifting when I was in high school.
*  I had the gift of strength.
*  I was pretty strong in high school all throughout my college days.
*  It was just something that I ... I think I was kind of born with it a little bit.
*  You don't just start lifting heavy weights like that all of a sudden.
*  You have to have a ... Like I said, you have to have some kind of natural talent for it.
*  Well, there's some crazy photos of you during the midst of the Olympia days when you were
*  a police officer.
*  Is that you?
*  Look at that.
*  Yeah, that's me in the ninth grade on the left, and that's me winning the ...
*  What happened to your arm on the left?
*  You got a cast on.
*  Yeah, I broke my ...
*  You fucked somebody up.
*  Yeah, no.
*  I got fucked myself.
*  I think I fell on my wrist or something and cracked it or something.
*  That's me winning the Mr. Universe, turning pro in the middle.
*  That's me winning the 99 Mr. Olympia, far right there.
*  Wow.
*  Damn, you were big.
*  Yeah, I was kind of big a little bit there.
*  A little bit?
*  Well, you know I got a lot bigger than that.
*  That was my second Olympia.
*  I only weighed about 255 there.
*  What's the biggest you ever got?
*  I was 295, my seventh one.
*  I put on a little bit more weight as I got on up there.
*  But is it one of those things where you just kind of have to keep up with everybody else
*  and everybody just keeps getting bigger and bigger?
*  No, it was that thing where me, I was trying to distance myself from everybody else.
*  So I kept getting bigger and bigger so nobody would catch up with me.
*  And what a lot of people don't understand is you see me big up there like that, but
*  it took a long time for me to get there.
*  That didn't happen overnight.
*  I put on about five pounds of muscle, between five and ten pounds of muscle a year.
*  And that came from all that heavy lifting, a lot of eating, a lot of eating.
*  What was the standard meal for you?
*  I mean, it wasn't a lot to me, but if somebody would try to eat it, it would probably be
*  a lot.
*  So I'd eat probably like a pound of chicken, grilled breast with half a cup of rice.
*  That was a normal meal?
*  Yeah, that was normal.
*  And how many of those did you have a day?
*  I had about six meals a day.
*  It's kind of hard to eat like that.
*  So I would have to wake up in the middle of the night to eat and go back to sleep.
*  Really?
*  Was that annoying?
*  No, no.
*  I would think that would be annoying.
*  You're tired and sleeping and you've got to wake up to eat?
*  No, you kind of get used to it.
*  When you eat like that, you're hungry every three hours.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah, every two or three hours you're hungry.
*  Because I'm not eating a lot of fat.
*  You know, it's lean.
*  I'm not eating a lot of carbs.
*  So it's a little bit of food at a time for me.
*  And you would get down to what percent body fat?
*  I was .33.
*  .33?
*  What does that mean?
*  Is that less than 3%?
*  That's less than half a percent.
*  Oh, .33.
*  Like what?
*  .33.
*  How does a human get that low?
*  I got a triplet to my genetics.
*  But was it also like a trickle down system?
*  Off season, say if you like, how many weeks would it take for you to get ready for Mr.
*  Olympia?
*  10 to 12.
*  10 to 12.
*  So at 12 weeks out, how much body fat do you think you were carrying around then?
*  About 3%.
*  So three was a high?
*  That's the highest, yeah.
*  Jesus.
*  Would you get tired all the time?
*  I'm 330 pounds at that though.
*  Oh my God.
*  Would you get tired all the time with that little body fat?
*  Well, I'm real good and fat.
*  That's good and fat.
*  3% body fat is good and fat.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Jamie, see if you can pull up a picture of him winning the seventh Mr. Olympia title
*  when he was at his heaviest.
*  I want to see what that looks like.
*  I was pretty big at that one.
*  Yeah, you were big, man.
*  I remember looking at the magazines and shaking my head.
*  Today, I would say, oh, that's Photoshopped.
*  They didn't have Photoshop back then.
*  No, they didn't have it back then.
*  I was a little bit too big for that one.
*  They had me to come down a little bit for the next one.
*  Oh, really?
*  So I came down to like 275.
*  So when you said they, coaches, your...
*  Some of the judges.
*  The judges?
*  Yeah.
*  The judges were telling you you're too big?
*  Yeah.
*  That's when you know you fucked up.
*  That's when you're getting crazy.
*  When the judges at Mr. Olympia are telling you, the guy who's won it, multiple years
*  in a row.
*  Yeah, seven years in a row, yeah.
*  They're telling you you're getting too big.
*  Yeah, getting too big.
*  Ronnie, take it down a notch.
*  Yeah.
*  Because the guy next to me is only like 250.
*  But why were they saying...
*  You still looked amazing.
*  Why were they saying you were too big?
*  Because I was at the time.
*  It really was too big?
*  Yeah, for standards back then.
*  They didn't have guys get that big.
*  How do they define that, though?
*  It's really just taste, right?
*  They look at it and they decide.
*  Subjective, yeah, in a way.
*  It's kind of subjective, in a way.
*  What year was the seventh one?
*  I think it was 05.
*  Was it 05, Ronnie?
*  No, that's the eighth one.
*  04 is number seven.
*  Yeah, there we go.
*  Yeah, that's it right there.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  God, you were huge.
*  That does look like a guy who comes out of a lab to kill the Hulk.
*  Like some evil genius, like the Hulk is working for the Avengers.
*  Yeah.
*  So how do they make that conversation with you when they say, Ronnie, you're too big?
*  Well, just talking to my nutritionist.
*  I had a nutritionist that did all my diets and all that kind of stuff for me.
*  So they probably just told him real nicely.
*  Yeah.
*  Break it down a notch.
*  Remember there's a photo of you when you were still on the police force and you were also,
*  I don't know if you were Mr. Olympian when you were on the police force, were you?
*  Yeah, three times, yeah.
*  And then you eventually left the force.
*  Yeah.
*  You were so big, you're sitting there with the uniform on, I'm like, there is no way
*  that's a regular uniform.
*  No, it's not.
*  No, it's not a uniform.
*  Did you wear those shorts?
*  That can't be real.
*  Did you arrest people with those shorts on?
*  No, I made those shorts myself.
*  But we did wear shorts though.
*  We did have shorts on at the police department.
*  I think you see that picture right there, I got on shorts in the briefing room, but
*  they're not showing my legs right there.
*  Right there.
*  Yeah, right there.
*  I have on shorts if you, that picture is actually bigger than that, but you just can't see.
*  Did that inspire other guys you worked with to start lifting too?
*  Yeah, yeah, pretty much.
*  I imagine.
*  Yeah, we had a gym at the station.
*  Oh really?
*  We had about four or five stations.
*  Every station has a gym.
*  We have a training center with a huge gym.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, I started working out there when I first hired on.
*  I worked out with me and the chief and some other guys when I worked out together there
*  for a while.
*  And this is in the beginning before you were gigantic.
*  Yeah, before I got real big.
*  You know, I had to start small.
*  Of course, everybody's a baby at one point in time.
*  So I was about, I was 215 when I first started.
*  When you first started, did you have this idea that one day, was this a dream?
*  No, no, no, no.
*  I did it because the guy gave me a free membership to the gym.
*  I never had a dream.
*  I just wanted a free membership because I was poor back then.
*  I couldn't afford to pay for a gym membership because I just hired on there.
*  Coming from Domino's Pizza, where I had to eat pizza every day to survive because I didn't
*  make that much money.
*  By the time I got to the police department, I was still struggling and trying to get back
*  on my feet and I couldn't afford a membership still.
*  And this was when you were 24?
*  Yeah, I was 24.
*  So you were just a big guy.
*  Yeah, I've been big and muscular my whole entire life.
*  But regular big, not like Mr. Olympia Big.
*  Well, I would say put a picture up there that somebody took not too long ago.
*  When I first got into the sport of bodybuilding, I was doing security at a Mr. Olympia event.
*  And most of the people in the audience thought that I should be on stage back then.
*  I didn't think so.
*  You know, what they thought that.
*  I had 22, 23 inch arms back then.
*  I had those 22, 21, 22 inch arms in college.
*  How big were they when you were at your biggest?
*  24.
*  24, that's the biggest they got.
*  That's like a waist.
*  Yeah, some girl.
*  Yeah, but like a runner.
*  Like Zach Bitter.
*  I bet Zach Bitter got a 24 inch waist.
*  Actually, my waist was like 29 when I first started.
*  Wow.
*  I remember Holyfield when he was the heavyweight champion of the world, he had a 28 inch waist.
*  That's crazy.
*  That's a V right there.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Yeah, crazy.
*  So you do this security for the Mr. Olympia event.
*  91, yeah.
*  Did that get like the bug in your head?
*  No, no, no.
*  Did you start thinking?
*  No?
*  No, no, no.
*  I never started thinking that.
*  How did it happen?
*  I won the first one in 98.
*  So how do you enter it?
*  What makes you want to enter something like that?
*  Well, like I said, the guy said if you compete, I give you a free membership to the gym.
*  Okay.
*  I was competing for a free membership to the gym because I was working full time at the
*  police department.
*  I had that job, I had like a couple of security jobs on the side.
*  So I didn't really need money from bodybuilding.
*  I had benefits and everything.
*  So you were just doing it for a free membership?
*  I was just doing it for a free membership.
*  So you do it and obviously people go, this guy's got real potential.
*  I guess they were saying that to themselves.
*  I never heard anybody say that.
*  So what did you do?
*  Like you just decided to keep going?
*  I just kept going for the free membership.
*  Yeah, I'm not going to give it up.
*  So competing just was about free memberships at one point in time.
*  When did it become serious?
*  When I won my first Olympia in 98.
*  That's when it became serious?
*  When you won your first Olympia?
*  Yeah.
*  Do you know how many bodybuilders right now want to jump out of a building?
*  They're going to go right to the top floor and fucking leap out a window.
*  Yeah, but see my dream was always to be a professional football player.
*  So I played football, junior high, high school, college and all that kind of stuff.
*  When I'd even drafted, I was like, okay, I got a degree so I can get a good job with
*  an accounting degree and I graduated with honors and all that kind of stuff.
*  I figured I'd just be an accountant and make good money there.
*  So I never had no dreams or aspirations of being in bodybuilding.
*  But you never were an accountant?
*  No, I never made it.
*  You never did?
*  I never got a job.
*  So you just got a job in the police department instead?
*  Uh huh, yeah exactly.
*  I tried for about two years.
*  To get an accountant job?
*  Yeah, I tried real hard.
*  I did a million interviews to some of the biggest accounting firms in the world, in
*  the United States anyway.
*  And nobody never hired me.
*  So I like two years later, okay I'm done.
*  This ain't meant to be, ain't nothing happening here, you know.
*  That's two years.
*  And I always saw an ad for police officers.
*  And when I got the newspaper every weekend.
*  And it was always a big ad, you know, so it stood out.
*  So I'm like, hmm, they hire and you don't need experience.
*  Because all the jobs I went on, you know, interviews I went on, they always want you
*  to have experience.
*  I'm like, well, you know, hire me, you know, you don't get no experience.
*  So I'm like, I might as well just give up on this, you know, just go give me a job where
*  you don't have to have experience.
*  And like I said, the police officer ad was the thing that stood out the most.
*  And I'm like, that's not like a job where I can have a lot of fun, you know.
*  I can't believe that you didn't really get serious until after you won Mr. Olympia.
*  That's hard to believe.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Well, you got to understand, you know, I never had any dreams of being a Mr. Olympia.
*  I never had any dreams of being a bodybuilder.
*  I only did it because the guy gave me a free membership to the gym.
*  But once you started getting going and you won Mr. Olympia and you realized, wow, I'm
*  the best.
*  I got to throw myself into this.
*  Exactly.
*  Because the way you worked out, man, I watched a video of you working out once and like
*  just the intensity and thinking like this guy's not just doing this for 12 weeks straight.
*  The intensity that you had in the gym, like you were, there's a certain level, no matter
*  what the sport is, champions have a certain level of focus and dedication.
*  Exactly.
*  And I remember watching that video and going, that's what a champion looks like.
*  That's what a champion looks like.
*  Well, you got to also think, realize that, you know, I started working out when I was
*  12.
*  I kind of fell in love with it when I was 13.
*  And it just kind of became a hobby once I joined the powerlifting team.
*  So I enjoy it working out.
*  When you won the first Mr. Olympia, how old were you then?
*  34.
*  Okay.
*  So you had a solid eight years of lifting, you know, this is after you were on the force
*  for a while.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  And I had already had the base too, you know, been in high school on the powerlifting team.
*  Now, powerlifting and lifting heavy is always a very controversial thing amongst bodybuilders,
*  right?
*  Because some bodybuilders never lifted as heavy as you did.
*  No, no.
*  What was your philosophy on that?
*  To each his own, you know, I lifted heavy because that's what I like to do.
*  And that's what I was able to do.
*  Like I said, I just was kind of like, in a way, I was kind of gifted to be strong like
*  that, you know.
*  And there's something that I was, I always was, even when I was in high school, I was
*  benching about 350.
*  Wow.
*  I was four.
*  You know, I was squatting five, over five in high school.
*  So that's just always something that's been a part of you?
*  Yes, that's always something that's been a part of me.
*  Now, what is a, when bodybuilders work out, for the most part, it's a lot of high reps
*  with weight that's not in the same, how would you do it?
*  I did it the same way, you know, I started out at, you know, like 20 reps, you know,
*  warming up and then 15 reps, then like 12, 10, something like that, on my last and
*  heaviest set.
*  So you still were doing fairly large number of repetitions?
*  Still doing them fairly large number of repetitions.
*  But much higher weight than a lot of folks were.
*  Yeah, I was like, so when I went up, I squatted, I went up to like 600.
*  I would do like, you know, 20 to 15 reps with that.
*  And benching, same, I'd go up to like 400, 20 to 15 reps with that.
*  That's a tremendous amount of weight.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  It sounds like it.
*  Yeah.
*  Until you go up against some of these guys that are doing crazy amounts of weights.
*  Now, you've also, since then, you've had a bunch of surgeries.
*  13 so far.
*  And what started that off?
*  Well, I kind of hurt my back in high school when I was powerlifting, and then I
*  hurt it again in college when I was playing football, hurt my back and neck.
*  And I did chiropractic for a long time.
*  And then one day in the gym, I hurt it like in 96, I kind of herniated a disc.
*  And I guess it just got worse over time.
*  So when you herniated that disc, what did you do to treat it?
*  Nothing, nothing.
*  I went to chiropractor.
*  Chiropractor, yeah.
*  I've been doing chiropractic all my life.
*  Yeah.
*  So I didn't, you know, I didn't have a surgery or nothing like that when I
*  herniated that disc.
*  They offered me to have surgery.
*  I told Noel.
*  So the surgery they wanted to do was probably trim the disc down because it
*  was pushing against the nerve.
*  Yeah.
*  Laminectomy, whatever they call it.
*  Yeah.
*  And so 13 of those, huh?
*  13.
*  Well, no, no.
*  13 surgeries.
*  Eight back, like two or three hip, two or three neck.
*  And did this all like happen all at once?
*  Where it's like, it felt like everything was falling apart or was it like you
*  get a surgery and then you're better for a little while and then you hurt
*  something else?
*  Yeah, something like that.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause the first one was back.
*  The second one was back.
*  And then I think the third one was neck and then back, back and hip, back,
*  back, back, hip.
*  And then what did you get done to your hips?
*  You get your hips replaced?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Both of them.
*  And like, what was they, what are you, was that 14?
*  I think.
*  Yeah.
*  14.
*  And how are those now?
*  I just had a hip surgery in January.
*  It's, it's, it's holding up a little bit better now.
*  One, one kind of went bad.
*  The sockets broke and they had to replace both of them.
*  And, uh,
*  They say they only last a certain amount of years, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Every night I had the titanium ones and the titanium was the hardest ones
*  because they rough and they titanium and they kind of hard on the body.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And because of that, you know, and me working out and all this kind of stuff,
*  and it kind of just broke the sockets.
*  Well, I follow you on Instagram and I watch your workouts and it's, it's
*  inspiring that after all this, you still love working out.
*  Yeah.
*  You can really tell.
*  I mean, you enjoy it.
*  Still a hobby.
*  Look forward to it every day.
*  Does it give you any pause at all?
*  Knowing that you've been through all these surgeries and no, you know,
*  when you're doing something that you truly love enjoying doing, that's what
*  you look forward to doing all the time.
*  So really regardless of, you know, how you feel, you know, of course I'm still
*  in pain and all that kind of stuff, but are you in pain all the time?
*  Yeah.
*  But as long as I'm doing what I love doing, I'm okay.
*  And you take that away, then probably won't be okay.
*  But so let just even sitting here right now, you're in pain.
*  No, just a minimum amount.
*  It's nothing major.
*  You know, if you're an athlete, you didn't paint all your life.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I can remember in high school and college, you know, I was in pain
*  some days all the time, all the time.
*  Yeah.
*  So after a while you kind of get used to it and doesn't really
*  bother you.
*  That's why, you know, I'm imagining that you have a spectacular tolerance for pain.
*  Yeah.
*  I have a high tolerance.
*  I remember when I, 180 in my days, I finished my workout.
*  I was squatting 600.
*  I remember like it was yesterday.
*  I was coming up on rep number eight and all of a sudden, payah!
*  It was a loud gunshot sound.
*  You know, I do 600 for like 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 20,
*  13 reps all the time.
*  This time I took a couple of weeks off and I thought I was still as strong as I was,
*  you know, when I took the time off, but I wasn't.
*  I lost a little strength.
*  And that's why that disc snapped on me like that.
*  I heard it and I felt it.
*  But, you know, the athlete in you is like,
*  you know, let's go on and finish this up.
*  So I finished up, you know, I did that leg press and some other exercises.
*  And every time after I finished working out, doing legs, I always had a,
*  a real bad pain in my back every single time.
*  But it would always go away in like an hour.
*  This day it didn't.
*  And I was, I just went home, ate, put on my uniform,
*  was headed to work and I'm like, wait a minute, my back is still hurting.
*  This is two hours, almost 12 later.
*  Something's wrong.
*  I ain't going to work today.
*  I'm going to emergency room.
*  Cause it was that bad.
*  Yeah.
*  And so he went to the emergency room.
*  They probably like, what the fuck are you doing?
*  The size of this guy.
*  Yeah.
*  Like we don't see nothing wrong with your back.
*  They probably couldn't get to it.
*  Well, they did x-ray and they like, we don't see anything.
*  So that's when I had an MRI a couple of days later and found out it was honeyed.
*  So I stayed at home for a couple of weeks and sat on the couch and didn't do
*  anything and two weeks later I went back to the gym.
*  First exercise was squats.
*  Oh my God.
*  Did it hurt again?
*  No, no, no, no.
*  I'll get ready for a show.
*  So, so it was okay.
*  Yeah, it was okay.
*  Two weeks after you herniated your disc, you're doing squats again.
*  Yeah.
*  But how much weight?
*  I only did 300.
*  Oh, only 300.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the most I could do for 10 reps, you know, 10 to 12 reps.
*  So I'm like, okay, this good enough, you know, but you knew that something was wrong.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I couldn't do 600 no more, you know, so.
*  So after that, how long before you got your first surgery?
*  10 years later.
*  10 years.
*  10 years.
*  So it was just intolerable pain.
*  Like what was going on?
*  I couldn't, I couldn't walk like no more than like 25 feet without my leg being on fire.
*  Oh, wow.
*  My feet being on fire.
*  And then in my law, a whole lot of pain.
*  Wow.
*  So I knew it's time to get some serious done here now.
*  So what was the first, did they fuse it?
*  Laminectomy.
*  They shaved it off.
*  Okay.
*  So that was the first one.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And I was, I was good for a while.
*  You know, I went back to squatting and everything.
*  And this is while you're still Mr. Olympia?
*  No, you know, I retired.
*  That was, I retired in 07.
*  So I had my first surgery in 07.
*  Okay.
*  So this is after you retired.
*  Yeah.
*  You're not doing too bad.
*  You just in a little bit of pain.
*  Yeah.
*  So how does it all go downhill from there?
*  I don't, I think maybe this, you know, the second, about a year or so later.
*  I started having problems again, being in pain again.
*  Same area?
*  Same area.
*  So squatting heavy still?
*  Yeah.
*  600 pounds still that kind of stuff?
*  No, because I wasn't competing.
*  So I was probably doing about four or 500 somewhere in there, but then, you
*  know, it's still kind of heavy.
*  Yeah.
*  And, uh, I don't have, I didn't have the weight that I used to have either.
*  You know, I wasn't 300 and some pounds or more.
*  So it was a little bit more difficult.
*  So it just kind of went bad on me again and I had to have another surgery.
*  Same kind of surgery.
*  They trim more off of it.
*  Actually, they did what you call like, uh, I forgot actually what they did.
*  It's been so long ago.
*  That was back in like, like 2008, 2009, somewhere in there.
*  They kind of like did a refresh.
*  It like they, I think they did trim a little bit more off it though.
*  But, uh, you know, it was all pretty much kind of like down here from there.
*  And so after that injury and that surgery, then how does, how does, how do
*  you wind up with the other 11 surgeries?
*  Well, I think like the first time you herniated a disc, it's like you can
*  you stack a bunch of cans on top of each other and you snap one out.
*  Well, after a while, the other ones are going to start falling out of place too.
*  And that's kind of what happened.
*  You know, the other day started just herniating on their own.
*  Of course I was working out too.
*  And, uh, I still have one now.
*  You got a herniated disc now?
*  Mm hmm.
*  Yeah.
*  How many discs have you had operated on?
*  All of them.
*  All of them.
*  Every single desk.
*  Every single one.
*  So this one that you have a herniated disc on now, if you already had it
*  operated on before?
*  No, this'll be the first time.
*  This is the last one.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  And so what do they do with your back?
*  They basically fuse everything together now?
*  Yeah.
*  So the whole spine is fused?
*  Yep.
*  Wow.
*  Neck and back.
*  How much mobility do you have?
*  I mean, I still, you know, bend over in Thomas's shoe and do all that kind of stuff.
*  But your back is one solid piece.
*  Yeah.
*  So there's no like articulation of your discs in your, your spine, your spinal
*  column.
*  Nothing.
*  Wow.
*  Nothing like that.
*  What does that feel like?
*  Uh, I mean, I guess it just feels kind of normal after a while.
*  You know, you get used to it.
*  It happens over time.
*  So it's like a gradual thing.
*  So it's not all of a sudden.
*  So it was just like one day, you know, you know, I used to be able to just bend over
*  and do all these stretches, these crazy stretches.
*  Well, I can't do all that no more.
*  Yeah.
*  I just bend over a little bit, you know, do a minor stretch.
*  Now, are the doctors, are they confident that this is the last one?
*  I mean, you've got them all fused.
*  Yeah.
*  It's always something though.
*  You know, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  When you an athlete and you're always working out and always in the gym, it's
*  going to always be something.
*  You just accept that.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  That's a, you're used to it after a while.
*  For a lot of people, that's a hard thing to accept this idea that you're just
*  going to keep smashing your body, but that's just you.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  I've got used to it now.
*  It's been so it's been happening since like oh seven or 13 years now.
*  Wow.
*  Now, are you in this wheelchair all the time?
*  No, no, I don't have crutches.
*  It's just that I left them at home.
*  I can walk maybe about from here to that wall unassisted, but you know, after,
*  after so, so after being up for so long, my legs get real weak.
*  And is it because of your back?
*  Yeah.
*  Closing my back.
*  Is it something that's like cutting off the nerves or something?
*  Exactly.
*  Wow.
*  Cutting off the nerves.
*  Yeah.
*  And is there anything they can do about that?
*  I mean, you know, maybe one day they'll come out with something that'll help get it
*  stronger.
*  I was thinking about trying the stem cell thing.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I said that that should help a lot too right there.
*  Well, there's a bunch of places that they do it where they could do it with a lot
*  stronger stem cells than they could do in America.
*  Like the place in Columbia does it.
*  And there's a place in Panama that actually sent my mom.
*  Yeah.
*  My mom, they wanted to give her a knee replacement.
*  Doctors just didn't want to operate right away.
*  And I was like, let me see if we can send you down to Panama.
*  Let me see if Dr. Reardon, he'd been in here before with Mel Gibson and he was talking
*  about Mel Gibson's dad and Mel Gibson's dad was in real bad shape when he was 92.
*  And then now he's 100 and he's fine.
*  I mean, he's gone back there a bunch of times, keeps going back for stem cells.
*  Yeah.
*  Long story short, my mom was scheduled to get a stem cell transplant.
*  Long story short, my mom was scheduled to get a knee replacement.
*  I sent her down to Panama and six months later, it started to feel good.
*  Eight months later, no pain at all.
*  Yeah.
*  It really did a great.
*  And then I sent her down a second time.
*  It's pretty amazing stuff, what they can do.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's my thing to do next.
*  Yeah.
*  And people I've talked to, they think they'll do me a lot of good.
*  So is it there's scar tissue around the nerves that's pushing against the nerves now?
*  Because if all the discs are gone and everything's fused, what's irritating the nerves?
*  Scar tissue,
*  all that hardware, I got 14 screws, two cages.
*  I got two rods, but this long and there are two.
*  So it's a lot of hardware, a lot of cages.
*  And
*  what are the cages look like?
*  So it's a cage around your spine?
*  Yeah.
*  What's the purpose of that?
*  I hold the discs together, keep them in place.
*  Yeah.
*  After a while, they don't want them to come loose.
*  So they put cages around them, keep them together.
*  So you're like RoboCop in there.
*  Yeah, pretty much.
*  So I got that in my neck and back.
*  You have a cage in your neck?
*  Yeah.
*  You got an x-ray of any of this shit?
*  Yeah.
*  Where is it at? Is it online?
*  I posted a couple of times online.
*  On your Instagram page?
*  Yeah.
*  See if you can find it, Jamie.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  You're just laughing about it.
*  Like, you're fine with it.
*  Well, you get used to it after all.
*  But is it also that you look at like, you're a legitimate legend.
*  And so do you look at it like, hey,
*  this is the price that I paid to be a legend?
*  Yeah, I look at it like, hey, I'm still alive and I can still work out every day.
*  I'm still normal, so I'm good.
*  Wow.
*  That's a great healthy attitude.
*  You're obviously still huge.
*  You're still very strong.
*  Well, I'm not as strong as I used to be.
*  I'm not as big as I used to be either.
*  I'm only like 250 now.
*  But when you say that, you're judging it on you being a multiple time Mr.
*  Olympia. That's not a regular person.
*  I'm not as big as I used to be.
*  You can't stay that big.
*  It's not possible.
*  No, no, no way. No way.
*  How many years you think?
*  I can't eat like that no more.
*  I bet it's nice to be able to eat when you want.
*  I don't eat half the food I used to eat.
*  I can only imagine.
*  Yeah.
*  I used to eat six.
*  I don't eat three now.
*  That's a normal person.
*  Yeah.
*  You got anything, Jamie?
*  Oh, that's going to be hard to find.
*  There it is.
*  Oh, my God.
*  That's crazy.
*  That's what a cage looks like.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  All that stuff's heavy duty.
*  The size of those screws in that picture on the left.
*  Yeah, they're about
*  three inches long,
*  two to three inches long.
*  Yeah. And they got screws on the end of them,
*  bolts on the end of you.
*  You can see on the end right here on that one.
*  On the left, those are bolts right there.
*  And those are big screws in between there, too.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, that goes all the way up.
*  All the way up your whole back.
*  Yeah. To my neck.
*  My neck is the same way.
*  Wow.
*  Three, four, five and six.
*  And so in doing this, they've saved your back,
*  but they've...
*  All the hardware is what's fucking with your nerves.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  All the hardware.
*  Yeah.
*  Pinching on the nerves, causing pain and stuff.
*  And what does the doctor say about that stuff?
*  There ain't nothing they can do about that.
*  It's just going to be like that.
*  They said they can take the screws out maybe one day,
*  but it's a major surgery to do that.
*  Yeah.
*  They got to cut me from all the way top to bottom
*  and take all those out.
*  It's 14 of them.
*  That started from the top all the way down to the bottom.
*  Would that be possible that if they did that,
*  it would alleviate some of the pinching on your nerves?
*  Yeah. Yeah, for sure.
*  Have you thought about it?
*  Yeah. I just went to the doctor and talked to him about it last week.
*  Oh yeah. What does he say?
*  He said, I got another 180 discs.
*  Oh boy.
*  And they need to fix that for anything about taking it out.
*  And where's the one that's herniated?
*  The new one is herniated?
*  It's up top.
*  See, all the ones, the lower ones are already fused.
*  Just the one on the top is the one that's herniated now.
*  Now, is it bulging or is it herniated?
*  He said herniated.
*  So pushing out.
*  I had a bulging disc that I had fixed with something called Regenekin.
*  Have you ever heard of Regenekin?
*  They invented it down in Germany
*  and a lot of athletes like Kobe Bryant and Peyton Manning,
*  they all went to Germany.
*  It's like this blood spinning procedure.
*  Have you heard of it?
*  Yeah, I've heard of it.
*  They do it in America now.
*  They have an office in Dallas.
*  They have an office in Santa Monica.
*  And I went to the one in Santa Monica.
*  And they take your blood out,
*  they spin it and they apply some medication to it.
*  And then it becomes this yellow serum.
*  And then they inject the yellow serum directly into the area where the disc is.
*  And it alleviates all the inflammation.
*  And the disc slowly goes back into place.
*  For me, within two weeks, I had extreme relief.
*  Within two weeks.
*  And then now there's no bulging disc at all.
*  I went back after I did the full round of treatments,
*  which I think was, if I remember correctly, five or six different treatments.
*  I went back, I got a new MRI and there's no bulge anymore.
*  Yeah, that's sort of like what they do when they do a PRP.
*  Yes, it is like PRP.
*  It's just more advanced.
*  It's just another level of PRP.
*  They do the injection thing.
*  Did you do the PRP?
*  Yeah, I did all that.
*  Did that help your neck at all?
*  No, it didn't do anything for me.
*  It did my neck and back, actually.
*  Well, I would wonder what would help you, like stem cells and then
*  get the screws out too.
*  That's going to be pretty much the only thing that's going to help me, I think.
*  So all this stuff with your legs, though,
*  that wasn't the case before the screws and before all those?
*  No, no, no.
*  Yeah, I would imagine that's what's going on, man.
*  It's all fused up, right?
*  It doesn't have to be screwed in, right?
*  No, no.
*  That's why I went to the doctor because they said after a couple of years,
*  everything would be fused up and I could take the screws out.
*  So does the doctor want to operate on your neck as well?
*  No, he just fixed my neck a year ago.
*  But the new bulge?
*  Yeah, this is the new bulge in my back now.
*  Oh, it's in your back?
*  Yes, this is my back.
*  Yeah.
*  That's why
*  that was the result of a cascading I had done last week.
*  Damn, dude, you you're at a hospital like every couple of weeks or?
*  It's not seem like it, though, but
*  I was just wanting to get the screws out because I'm, you know,
*  it's been a long time and still in pain and like I said,
*  still pinching me and still got, you know, the nerves being pinched.
*  And I think, you know, my legs are numb, too.
*  My foot's totally numb.
*  Yeah.
*  And I was thinking maybe if I took the screws out, I get some of this numbness to go away.
*  Yeah.
*  And I get some strength back also.
*  Do you think you're going to wind up doing that?
*  If possible, one day I would like to.
*  Man, I'm hoping someone hears this,
*  that's a specialist that has a solution for you.
*  How many different doctors have you seen?
*  Right now, just
*  one.
*  Just the one doctor.
*  Just the one.
*  Is there a local guy near you?
*  Yeah, yeah, local guy.
*  And Fort Worth, Texas.
*  Also, my first surgery, my, no, no, probably like my fourth or fifth one.
*  They operated on me for about 13 hours.
*  They cut me in the front, turn me over on the side, cut me on the side.
*  And then they put me on my back and cut me on my back.
*  Jesus.
*  And that gave me a lot of problems.
*  That started the immobility thing right there.
*  And what was the surgery?
*  I was good until I did that surgery.
*  What kind of surgery was that?
*  It was another fusion?
*  Yeah.
*  Why do they have to cut you in so many places?
*  Because they had to fuse so many
*  this, putting in so many screws.
*  And that was in 15, I think.
*  Wow.
*  At 16, December 15th, I remember getting off the plane in Russia.
*  In Russia?
*  Yeah.
*  You got that done in Russia?
*  No, no, I remember getting off the plane in Russia and I'm like, man, my back is hurting.
*  And I was walking fine to the hotel.
*  The next day,
*  my mobility got worse.
*  And the day after, I was on crutches.
*  And I've been on them ever since.
*  Just so out of nowhere.
*  Out of nowhere.
*  And how far out from the surgery was this?
*  The surgery was like the next month.
*  Oh, so this is before the surgery?
*  Yeah, this is before.
*  Yeah.
*  OK, so then they cut you open the front and the side and the back.
*  And then everything's downhill from there.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, everything was down here from there.
*  Man, I'm really hoping that somebody
*  listens to this and some doctor hears about this.
*  Well, one thing is you're in Fort Worth.
*  Dr.
*  Reardon is actually his office is in Dallas.
*  That's pretty close to you.
*  Yeah, that's real close to me.
*  I'd love to connect you to him and see if there's anything that he could do.
*  Yeah, that would be nice.
*  Because I'm always looking to get better because these crutches are getting
*  on my nerves.
*  I can only imagine.
*  After five years now.
*  And a guy who is the level of athlete that you were when you were in your prime.
*  And how old are you now?
*  I just turned 56 two weeks ago.
*  You look great.
*  Well, I'm still working out every day and
*  eating good.
*  Yeah, it would be nice if they could do something to turn this back around.
*  I like to get my strength back.
*  Yeah, I guarantee Dr.
*  Reardon could probably help.
*  Yeah, I don't want to guarantee, but he's a real expert in
*  stem cells and the benefits of stem cells.
*  Well, maybe I give him a call.
*  Yeah, I'll connect you to for sure.
*  So what's a normal day like for you these days?
*  Well, I got four kids at home.
*  Five.
*  Six.
*  Eight, nine.
*  So that keeps you busy.
*  That keeps me extremely busy.
*  I'm taking them to Burger King every day.
*  And I'm just riding around with them, doing what I do.
*  You know,
*  if I like, go to car wash, wash the car, they with me.
*  I go to a friend's house with them.
*  You know, they're with me.
*  So most of the time you're just walking on these crutches.
*  Yeah, I'm always on the crutches.
*  So, yeah, I hang out with them all day now.
*  That's my day.
*  Before, you know, I was going on the road every other weekend,
*  every two weeks.
*  Seminars and things like that.
*  All that kind of stuff.
*  Appearances.
*  But since the virus, I've been
*  hanging with them. They become my best friend.
*  Are you enjoying that?
*  Yeah.
*  There's something that a lot of people found some enjoyment from this being locked at home.
*  Yeah, it's a lot of fun.
*  Yeah.
*  Because it forces you to take time off.
*  Yeah, I got used to it now.
*  I got lazy.
*  Now I just want to stay home now.
*  Well, there's something nice about being home a lot.
*  I mean, I've only been on the road a couple of times since this lockdown.
*  It's a lot of niceness about being home.
*  It's nice.
*  And the big thing for me that I found is health.
*  Like you feel better because you're not traveling all the time.
*  Exactly. Well, you know, I don't get sick.
*  So you don't get sick ever?
*  No, no, never.
*  Really?
*  Wow.
*  I can remember like two or three days of my life I've been sick.
*  The funny the way you said it was funny.
*  I don't get sick.
*  Like you're not talking about I don't usually get sick.
*  Like I don't get sick.
*  No, I don't really get sick.
*  Wow.
*  I don't get cold and flu and all that kind of stuff.
*  I've had like a stomach flu like two or three times in my life.
*  Wow.
*  That's about it.
*  But traveling on the road does wear you out though, right?
*  Get a little run down.
*  You get used to it.
*  Yeah. Yeah, you get used to it.
*  Did you have any strategies to like beat jet lag or anything like that?
*  I didn't get jet lag after a while.
*  You don't get colds.
*  You didn't get jet lag.
*  Yeah. When I first started traveling, I used to get it.
*  Yeah. But after a while, you don't get it anymore.
*  Do you just get used to it?
*  You just get used to it.
*  So when you would land somewhere, would you just immediately work out?
*  Go to the gym.
*  Yeah, that's the move, right?
*  I get off the plane, go to the gym.
*  That does reset you.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  That's my favorite thing to do.
*  I've landed in a hotel room.
*  I have it set up like, like, like, you know, after you eat,
*  you brush your teeth. When I land, I go to the gym.
*  Yeah, that's what I do.
*  That's what I do.
*  Yeah.
*  That is one way.
*  It sucks.
*  Like you're tired, you're worn out from travel.
*  But if you can force yourself, you feel a lot better.
*  Well, I've made it to where I can sleep on the airplane.
*  And I sleep pretty good.
*  So by the time I get to where I'm going, you know, I'm all rested up.
*  I'm good to go.
*  Now, when you were competing, were you,
*  I mean, you're eating all these meals a day.
*  Were you drinking a shitload of water, too?
*  Like, how much water are you drinking?
*  Like a shitload of water.
*  Like you said, I was drinking like two or three gallons a day.
*  Two or three gallons.
*  The gym I worked at, there's no AC and it's a hundred and five hundred ten sometimes.
*  Oh, it's in Fort Worth?
*  It's in Arlington, which is right next to Fort Worth.
*  That's hot as fuck.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  And then I worked for the police department.
*  I had this vest on all the time, so I was drenched every day after work.
*  So I'm always drinking water there.
*  So you have to drink a lot of water.
*  Now, as far as like supplements and nutrition and vitamins and things along
*  those lines, you were talking about what you ate.
*  But like, what other stuff would you take?
*  Oh, I had a nutritionist, so he did my whole plan.
*  And some of the stuff I don't even remember that he had me doing.
*  But it was quite a bit of stuff.
*  Was it based on blood work?
*  Do your blood work and then?
*  Yeah, I did blood work probably like three times a year.
*  And he made sure I got plenty vitamins and plenty minerals and other things.
*  You know, because I didn't like vegetables.
*  So he would kind of supplement, you know, vitamins and stuff for that.
*  You didn't eat vegetables at all?
*  At all. Really?
*  No.
*  Some people think you don't need them.
*  There's a whole...
*  That was me.
*  There's a bunch of people that are on what's called a carnivore diet.
*  Have you heard that?
*  Yeah, that's me.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a bunch of people that don't eat vegetables.
*  They basically mostly eat meat.
*  Yeah, I would eat
*  baked potato.
*  And
*  rice. That was about it.
*  But why is it mostly chicken?
*  Why does a bodybuilder mostly eat chicken because it's so lean?
*  Yeah, lean chicken breast.
*  You know, it's the leanest you can get pretty much.
*  I also had steak at least once a day.
*  Also lean steak, you know, like filet mignon.
*  So I'd eat chicken three times a day,
*  turkey also, and steak.
*  Now, when the competition was over and you won,
*  did you pig out? Did you go crazy?
*  I went crazy.
*  Every single time.
*  I started out with Pizza Hut.
*  I'd eat that first.
*  I had that in the room when I got back.
*  As soon as Pizza Hut was over, I went to McDonald's.
*  I pig out there.
*  And when we got left there, I went straight to strip club.
*  And pig out there?
*  And pig out there.
*  Now, how long would you do this before you get back to work?
*  Oh, just that night.
*  Just one night.
*  Yeah.
*  And then back to the gym on Monday?
*  No, no, no. I took three months off after.
*  Oh, three months. Really?
*  Three months with no lifting at all?
*  No lifting, no nothing.
*  I ate what I wanted to eat.
*  I didn't work out, didn't do cardio.
*  Nothing.
*  Why did you take that much time off?
*  Because I felt I needed it.
*  Yeah.
*  I was kind of like, you know, recharging the battery.
*  Because I knew once I started back,
*  wasn't going to be no, you know,
*  no lift, non-lifting kind of stuff.
*  Is it weird to make that transition from this crazy Spartan life of 12 weeks of
*  just hardcore training to, boom, shut it off?
*  No. Three months.
*  No.
*  It was nice?
*  After that 12 weeks of hardcore training, you're looking for a break.
*  I would imagine.
*  Yeah.
*  And, you know, I had also worked out before that, too.
*  So I take off.
*  The show is always in September.
*  So it's like October, November, December, nothing.
*  And then January start back up.
*  And then when you start back up, go all the way to September.
*  And when you would start back up, do you start back up full force, hardcore?
*  Start all over.
*  All over. Start all over.
*  Start all over.
*  Wow.
*  So you just had it down to a science.
*  You knew what to do and when to do it.
*  Yeah, because I hurt myself that one time
*  why I didn't start all over.
*  So you learn from your mistakes.
*  That was when you hurt your back.
*  When you stopped, when you retired for good, was that difficult to do?
*  Is it difficult to change your life?
*  That's still difficult to do.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I miss working police department and competing both.
*  Yeah, yeah, I miss them tremendously.
*  Just because of the action.
*  Yeah.
*  Being having a purpose.
*  Yeah. Basically.
*  Obviously, this is a crazy time for the police.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  It wasn't like that when I was police.
*  Yeah. What was it like?
*  Oh, it was much easier.
*  But where you were was probably a more relaxed place.
*  It was some crazy people.
*  Yeah.
*  We had a lot of crazy people, actually.
*  A lot of crazy people.
*  I didn't know people were that crazy.
*  To join the force.
*  Yeah. We had what?
*  We started with 300 something thousand, I guess.
*  When I retired, there was about almost 600,000 people.
*  The city grew that big.
*  Over 15 years.
*  Yeah. So I worked there for 15 years.
*  Well, we're in the middle of a crazy time when it comes to police and police brutality.
*  And did you see a lot of that shit when you were on the job?
*  No. No.
*  No, we didn't.
*  You didn't have to mistreat people back then, at least me.
*  And most of the guys I worked with, we were all professional.
*  Everybody had to have a four year degree.
*  They used the force was
*  appropriately applied.
*  So I remember I got in trouble a couple of times.
*  Well, one time I got in trouble.
*  Well, I almost I almost used too much force on the guy.
*  But I was vindicated.
*  And all I did was just bend his arm back, put handcuffs on him.
*  But in the process of doing it, he got a bloody nose and a bloody mouth.
*  Arm ripped out of the socket a little bit.
*  But you're just doing what you had to do to subdue him.
*  Yeah.
*  So that was the only time that I really
*  got used to force filed against me.
*  And I got a lot of commendation out of that because I was a writer back in the day.
*  I used to write for the college newspaper.
*  And I was sports editor also.
*  So I was good at writing.
*  I could write real good and I could apply
*  use of force techniques that they taught me in the academy.
*  So that report that I wrote on that use force complaint,
*  they use that report to train recruits.
*  Do you think that that's what's wrong with these abusive cops?
*  Do you think it's a lack of training or do you think it's hiring the wrong people
*  for the job? What do you think it is?
*  Hiring the wrong people for the job.
*  That job is so stressful.
*  Yeah. I mean, you
*  you have to be real confident in your abilities.
*  To protect yourself.
*  And I was very, very confident.
*  I never had to even use my nightstick on anybody.
*  Well, you know, come on.
*  I went to sometimes I would go to work looking for a fight.
*  And I was so bored, you know.
*  And it never happened.
*  Nobody never fought me.
*  What's the size of you, man?
*  And then so all the guys that were half my size,
*  I would just run to their fights
*  and try to help them out.
*  Help them out. Yeah.
*  Because nobody would never fight me.
*  I'm like, oh man.
*  Still. What do you mean still?
*  You're 300 pounds.
*  Well, that's when I was in my twos.
*  Oh, the 290.
*  Yeah, 215 when I first got there.
*  OK. 220, 230, 240, 250.
*  Yeah. Now, of course, you know, heavy I got.
*  I didn't expect it then.
*  But when I was in my twos, I thought for sure somebody.
*  But I had like I said, I had 22 inch arms.
*  Right. You know, I had those uniform that Taylor made.
*  So my arm stuck out.
*  Do you think that I mean, there's all this talk now defunding the police.
*  I keep hearing this about the defunding the police.
*  Yeah, I've been hearing that too.
*  But I don't know if I can agree with that.
*  Because you need the police.
*  You need the police. You need.
*  I agree. Yeah, you agree.
*  You can't defund the police.
*  You really.
*  There are people that really need the police.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  But I went on a lot of calls.
*  Yeah. Well, I needed to be there.
*  Right. So I don't know.
*  I don't know if I really agree with that.
*  I think they've got to get rid of abusive cops.
*  That's what they got to do. That's what they got to do.
*  They got to get rid of the bad apples.
*  Yeah. Once you get rid of the bad apples and.
*  I think it's all good.
*  I try to explain to people when I talk about it.
*  I'm like, you got to understand that there's millions of interactions
*  of people have the cops every day and most of them are positive.
*  Most of them are positive.
*  If you get a hundred people in a room, just a hundred random people in the room,
*  what are the odds that one of them is a fucking idiot?
*  It's pretty good. Right.
*  Well, that's the same thing with cops.
*  You have I don't know how many millions of cops there are in this country.
*  I don't know how many what the number is, but
*  you're going to have a certain amount of cops that should never have that job.
*  They should. They're they're they're they're bullies.
*  They're mean, sociopaths.
*  They're undisciplined.
*  They're not they're abusive.
*  Yeah, they're not built for that job.
*  That job is not for everybody.
*  It takes a strong mind.
*  It takes a strong mind.
*  It takes a lot of heart.
*  And how many cops you think are dealing with just crippling PTSD every day?
*  And all depends on where you are, I think.
*  Like New York City.
*  Yeah, like New York, L.A.
*  You know, Detroit, Chicago, Chicago.
*  Yeah, places like that.
*  Yeah, I can see it.
*  But I was just reading a story about Chicago that over one weekend,
*  25 people were murdered.
*  Yeah. So we had about six, seven a year where I'm from.
*  That's a lot better number.
*  Yeah, they probably have six, seven a day.
*  Yeah. I mean, 25 in a weekend is just crazy.
*  That's the craziest thing you ever hear.
*  Chicago is bad. It's bad.
*  Unimaginable bad.
*  So if you're a cop and you're in an environment like that,
*  you're essentially in a war zone.
*  But kind of. Yeah.
*  I bet you don't look forward to going to work every day.
*  Like I did when I worked.
*  Well, now today, it means people are so mad at cops that they just want to openly
*  disrespect them and and yell at them.
*  But some people know the good cops.
*  Yes, some people do, but some people use it as an excuse to say that all cops suck.
*  And, you know, that guy that I don't remember his name, that guy that killed
*  George Floyd, that guy is an example of everything that's wrong about police
*  officers, everything that's wrong, everything that's wrong.
*  He'd been doing a long time.
*  He'd been abusing people for a long time.
*  He had a bunch of complaints.
*  17 complaints is what I heard.
*  Yeah. But yet they kept him on.
*  Kept him on. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I don't think you could have more than like two or three where I'm from.
*  That's how it should be.
*  And we don't have unions and all that kind of stuff either.
*  Once they fire you, you out of there.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, a lot of guys got fired for bad reports.
*  Hmm.
*  One guy told me got fired for not writing enough tickets.
*  That's fucked up.
*  I was like, that doesn't make any sense to me because what if nobody speeds?
*  Like, what if you like they say you have to write X amount of tickets per week?
*  What if everybody follows the rules?
*  That's the first time I ever heard that.
*  Yeah, that's the first time.
*  I'm still reluctant to believe that.
*  I should have asked somebody that was in
*  a higher power, you know,
*  because when I worked, they always told me you need to write more tickets.
*  I'm like, OK, so I go out and write a ticket.
*  I'll be done with it.
*  You know, that's more tickets, you know.
*  That's one more than I had on my last review.
*  So but they never say we're going to fire you.
*  You know, you're going to write.
*  Maybe there's other things as well.
*  Yeah.
*  But is it a different police department you worked for?
*  All in the police department?
*  No, the guy, the other guy that you were talking about.
*  He worked for the same one.
*  That's why I was just trying to get rid of him.
*  It had to be.
*  It was probably something he did, you know, because, you know, a couple of guys I
*  worked with, they got in trouble once and they're like, no more.
*  And you get in trouble again.
*  They they fire you.
*  But they told you no more, you know, like they're real strict where I work, you know.
*  I think that's how to be 17 complaints.
*  I think they do or three and you out of there.
*  That makes sense. That's yeah.
*  I mean, it's such a rough job to begin with.
*  Yeah. And I'm from a tourist town also.
*  We got six flags.
*  We got cowboys, got Rangers.
*  So you you have to be you have to be good to the people there.
*  That makes sense.
*  Yeah, that should be the whole country mistreating people.
*  That should be the whole country.
*  I think cops should get paid more money.
*  They should be treated better.
*  They should be trained better.
*  We got paid a lot of money.
*  We was like the top five in the state.
*  Always.
*  Well, I mean, I feel like that's the only way you're going to get really good people
*  for the job and you have to have a four year degree.
*  You can't have like two years in a diploma.
*  You can't have 20 years of service in
*  another department and come work there.
*  You have to have a four year degree.
*  So they want people educated, respectful, do a good job.
*  That's the whole country.
*  I totally agree.
*  But you know how many guys would get hired if it was like that?
*  Not as many.
*  But shouldn't that mean I just feel like we're at a tipping point in this country?
*  I totally agree.
*  I mean,
*  it's real sad that the people you call to help you hurt you.
*  Yeah. And all the time.
*  All the time.
*  That's a sad, sad environment to be in.
*  Yeah. I mean, I feel like defunding is just going to make it worse.
*  Make it worse.
*  Yeah. And make these crime-ridden neighborhoods even more dangerous.
*  Yeah. You need you need police everywhere.
*  Yeah. Everywhere.
*  And like I said, defunding is just going to make it worse.
*  You have to have a lot of resources.
*  You have to have a lot of training.
*  Yes. It's a lot of training.
*  You have to be training all the time,
*  all the time, no matter how many years you've been there.
*  You have to be trained up all the time.
*  Yeah. That's I couldn't agree more.
*  I mean, it sounds horrible for people to hear, but I think they needed more funding.
*  Yeah. Even though the police are fucked up, they need more education.
*  They need more money.
*  More money, more training.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  And I feel like they should be trained the same way the military is trained.
*  And that way they weed out the weak people, too.
*  Yeah. Weed out the people with the weak minds.
*  Weed out the bullies, weed out the sociopaths.
*  Yep.
*  But
*  I guess it's just a hard job to get, you know,
*  a not wanted job, I'll say.
*  Yeah. But I think there's also just people in everything.
*  Every job there is, there's people that suck at it.
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  And you're going to you can't suck at being a cop.
*  Yeah. You know, you just you can't.
*  But like I said, it's a lot of people do.
*  Yeah.
*  And like I said, it's kind of hard to find good candidates sometimes.
*  Are you still in touch with all the guys in the force that you worked with?
*  No, all the guys I worked with retired.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, that was that was a while ago.
*  Yeah.
*  See, I started in 1989.
*  So you got to remember that's what, 30 something years later.
*  So most of the guys retired and like we have 20 year retirement.
*  They must have really enjoyed having a guy like you as a cop on the force.
*  I did a lot of recruiting trips for the police department.
*  So they told me
*  when I won the Olympia, she said, you don't have to come work if you want to.
*  Really? Yeah.
*  You just get paid. Yeah.
*  And just wait.
*  If I don't come work, I don't get paid.
*  Oh, but I was making.
*  I was making a million dollars a year being Olympia.
*  I don't need 45
*  from the police department or 50,000, whatever they was paying me.
*  So
*  sometimes I didn't go to work.
*  Like when I got ready for the Olympia.
*  I didn't go to work.
*  So they just let you take time off and then after you'd win, you come back.
*  Yeah. Was it weird to go back to work?
*  No, no. Yeah, I remember.
*  But did you ever get pulled over?
*  I loved that job.
*  I appreciate you enjoyed that job.
*  But was it every time where you pull people over and like, holy shit, are you Ronnie Coleman?
*  Yep.
*  And that's why I quit pulling people over and writing tickets.
*  That's why because of that.
*  What did they assign you to after that?
*  No, no, I still worked patrol.
*  I just didn't pull people over.
*  Oh, I see.
*  That's subjective.
*  That's something you want to do.
*  Oh, you can just make a decision.
*  Yeah, yeah. You're a decision.
*  You know, you can always just answer calls.
*  There's always a disturbance.
*  There's always an accident.
*  I mean, there's always a fight.
*  Did you ever see the TV show where Steven Seagal was a cop?
*  No, never.
*  I could watch.
*  I could watch.
*  I couldn't watch any cop shows as being one.
*  Really? No, because that's what you do.
*  Right. You don't want to see.
*  It's like something you do all the time.
*  You don't want to do it in your spare time.
*  I understand. You're looking for other stuff to do.
*  Yeah.
*  It was a real funny show.
*  Yeah.
*  Steven Seagal was working as a real cop for a while.
*  I heard about it.
*  I heard it was the most ridiculous shit you've ever seen in your life.
*  He would pull people over and they're like, you fucking Steven Seagal?
*  And, you know, it was real, real weird, man.
*  He all of a sudden, I mean, he was in Louisiana.
*  So he adopted from he adopted this fake Louisiana accent, like real heavy.
*  Yeah.
*  A lot of heavy accents there.
*  But he all of a sudden had one.
*  You can you can develop it from being around those people.
*  I can imagine.
*  It seemed like he was just adding it.
*  Well, you know, he's professional.
*  Yeah.
*  But it was just like a real cop.
*  He was really pulling people over.
*  The whole thing was so ridiculous.
*  I guess he was bored.
*  I think he was bored.
*  I think he was, you know, in between.
*  Well, you know, that could be pretty exciting.
*  It can be really exciting.
*  Look at him.
*  I mean, you imagine you're a guy and you're in your house and maybe you're smoking
*  some weed and the cops break down the door and it's fucking Steven Seagal.
*  Well, holding you down.
*  Yeah. Most of the guys, they're trying to get away.
*  So they're not looking at the guy.
*  I understand. But I mean, part why are you getting cuffed?
*  You've got to be looking up going, what the fuck are you doing here, man?
*  I have video of me arresting people on video also.
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
*  I was
*  doing videos and me were training and sometimes I would have a guy just follow
*  me the whole shift and he would film me the whole shift.
*  And I was able to put some of them
*  on tape. I had to get the approval from the police department.
*  Did you put it on YouTube or something?
*  Yeah.
*  So they're out there right now?
*  Yeah, out there right now.
*  Did you learn any martial arts or anything from the police department?
*  Yeah, of course.
*  What did you learn?
*  I mean, they just taught you basic stuff,
*  how to take people down, pressure points and all that kind of stuff.
*  So it's probably not a martial art.
*  It's just take down techniques and stuff like that.
*  Pressure point.
*  I imagine a guy like you just grabbing a hold of someone.
*  They must have felt like they were made out of pillows.
*  You know what?
*  To be honest with you, I never had to really grab anybody.
*  Nobody's amazing.
*  Nobody ever wanted to fight me.
*  That's one good
*  argument for being a huge person.
*  Yeah, it was real good and real bad.
*  Bad in the sense that I missed out on a lot of action.
*  So you
*  missed out on a lot of action.
*  Bad and good at the same time.
*  But you kind of itched for it a little bit.
*  I itched for it every single day.
*  Really?
*  You got to remember, I played football for 15 years and you used to, you know,
*  contact, contact.
*  So you you kind of missed it after a while.
*  You want to engage in a little bit.
*  But you can't you can't violate rights.
*  Of course.
*  So, you know, well, that shows amazing restraint that you wanted to do it every
*  day, but you never did it.
*  Never did it.
*  Yeah.
*  That's maybe they said maybe once or twice.
*  Maybe once twice.
*  Yeah.
*  But nothing serious.
*  Nothing serious.
*  You know, yeah, I may, you know,
*  you know,
*  pull somebody's arm out of the socket or dislocate somebody's shoulder or something
*  like that just because they probably had weak joints.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  There you are.
*  They say, well, yeah, they said imagine this dude walking in your house.
*  I got a choice right there.
*  Look at the size of you.
*  Oh, my God.
*  You were so big.
*  That's so crazy.
*  Three hundred and fifteen pounds right there.
*  But it must have been so crazy for people.
*  Two percent body fat.
*  We had our body fat done at the police department.
*  And the highest I ever got was three percent.
*  And that was with calipers?
*  Yeah, calipers.
*  Did you ever do it?
*  When I had the three point three three was
*  dipped underwater.
*  Wow.
*  It was negative numbers.
*  It was minus two.
*  That's so crazy.
*  Minus two percent body fat.
*  That doesn't even make sense.
*  And yeah, your arms are so big.
*  It looks like you barely pick your arm up to your wrist.
*  Twenty three right there.
*  I'm almost 24.
*  I just can't imagine.
*  They got a choice right there.
*  Yeah, there you go.
*  Those are the company issues.
*  And they fit you?
*  Yeah, yeah. Everything was tailor made.
*  The city has a tailor.
*  So I went to the city tailor for all my clothes and all my vests and everything.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Did you keep any of that stuff?
*  Yeah, I still got it.
*  That should be in like a bodybuilder slash policemen hall of fame somewhere.
*  You know what?
*  They actually took my badge and put it in and on display at the station.
*  Oh, yeah. That's cool.
*  Yeah. Look at the size of you.
*  Does it freak you out when you see yourself that big?
*  No. Wow.
*  No, you don't really see it after you had it for so long.
*  But not looking at it now, I'm kind of missing it.
*  Do you? Oh, yeah.
*  Really? Oh, yeah.
*  Too bad you can't stay like that forever.
*  Well, I'd imagine a lot of your identity gets tied into that.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  You hate getting old, but it happens to everybody.
*  Yeah. Well, if all the time is undefeated.
*  It's old for sure, but it's also for you.
*  It's just the amount of destruction.
*  All that hard training is done to your body.
*  Yeah. Yeah. All the fun I had in the gym.
*  I had a lot of fun lifting all that heavy weight.
*  People ask me if I had any regrets.
*  Yeah, I have some regrets.
*  I didn't go heavy enough.
*  Really?
*  That was one time I was squatting at 800.
*  I thought it was going to be heavy because I deadlifted already.
*  But I was squatting at this time and I didn't take into effect
*  the gravity of the situation.
*  When you pull it from the floor,
*  when you got it way up here on your shoulder,
*  gravity is way down there, so that's pulling.
*  So when I went down for the first rep, I'm like, is this 800?
*  And I came back up and I'm like, let me do another one.
*  It's still easy.
*  But I had in my mind two, because I had already done two on the deadlift.
*  And I put it up and I'm like, oh, man, I could have did at least three or four more.
*  That bothers you to this day?
*  That bothers me to this day.
*  To this day.
*  But I went to the leg press and did 2300
*  pounds on the leg press for eight reps.
*  How much? 2300, 2300.
*  That would crush me.
*  Eight reps. Yeah.
*  That's on YouTube also.
*  That doesn't even make sense.
*  Yeah. That's a car.
*  You had to add it up with a calculator.
*  Yeah, I had to bring out a calculator to add it up.
*  There's so much weight.
*  Why would you lift so much weight?
*  Because I could.
*  No other reason.
*  Look at this.
*  This is so ridiculous.
*  Yeah. How many times have you done this before?
*  I did that one time.
*  What the fuck is that?
*  That's so crazy.
*  That's 2300 pounds.
*  That is so crazy.
*  Yeah. I saw a video of a girl trying to use one of those things and her knee bent
*  backwards and see I came all the way back.
*  Well, some people that put that on there, they didn't come that far back.
*  You know.
*  So this is right after the 800 pound squat.
*  You got to remember that.
*  So I'm a little tired.
*  I'm a little tired.
*  Not real tired.
*  That is insane.
*  Yeah.
*  Back then it was.
*  I couldn't.
*  I can't do.
*  How many reps are you doing?
*  Eight. I think I did eight.
*  That's very hard to believe.
*  Yeah.
*  It's very hard to believe even looking at it.
*  Look at all those 45.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like 50 some place.
*  50 of them.
*  That is bonkers, man.
*  Yeah.
*  I bought that machine specifically to do that because the regular machine couldn't
*  do that because the first time I put it on there, that bar bent.
*  So he had to reinforce the bar
*  for, you know, so I could do it.
*  How are your knees right now?
*  My knees are perfect.
*  I wrapped up all the time.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Wrapped all the time when I went heavy.
*  That's crazy.
*  The knees are OK.
*  No problem whatsoever.
*  And everything else is all.
*  Yeah. Just the back and neck.
*  Yeah.
*  I miss those days.
*  God damn.
*  Now, what kind of steroids were dudes doing back then?
*  I mean, basic.
*  You know, you got, you know, your tests,
*  Deball,
*  it's just basic stuff, you know.
*  And back then, you know, because the DA had come in
*  and, you know, was trying to find out what we were all doing,
*  they made us do it legally.
*  So, you know, you had to go to the doctor and get all these prescriptions.
*  And you would get prescriptions for steroids?
*  Yeah.
*  What kind of steroids would they give you a prescription for?
*  Like any kind of test you needed.
*  They would give growth hormone.
*  They give prescriptions because once the DEA came in, they was like,
*  what are y'all doing? What are y'all taking?
*  But when you think like the DEA,
*  shouldn't you be out there catching people selling meth?
*  Why are you going after bodybuilders who are also cops?
*  That seems ridiculous.
*  Because they had kids out there where they were taking it and committing suicide.
*  See, I didn't know what that was when I was a kid.
*  They were committing suicide because they were getting depressed from the steroids
*  or coming off of it. Coming off of it.
*  Yeah.
*  So they're trying to figure out, you know, what are y'all doing?
*  What it was?
*  We got to get y'all off this stuff.
*  And so that's when you got a doctor that was willing to prescribe everything.
*  So was this while you were doing Mr. Olympia?
*  Yeah.
*  So all that stuff was above board, was all legal.
*  Yeah. Everything was legal back then.
*  What is it? Is that the case now?
*  You know what? That was just when the heat was on.
*  I don't think they got the heat on the guys now.
*  So the DEA would come to you and you would just say, hey, here's my prescriptions.
*  Yeah.
*  And they would go, all right.
*  Yeah.
*  Mm hmm.
*  One time, if you didn't have a prescription, they took your stuff.
*  Really? Yeah.
*  So they'd find whatever you had and take it from you.
*  Yeah.
*  Hmm.
*  Yeah.
*  How do they know where it was?
*  You told them.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Because otherwise they'd put you in jail.
*  Yeah.
*  Then search your house, you know, get a search warrant.
*  But I got this, this.
*  Well, I'd imagine you would have to take something to be as big as you were when
*  you were at your peak.
*  It's not really possible to be that big without it.
*  Without it. No, no.
*  You can't get that big.
*  Another thing you got to have too is genetics.
*  Yes.
*  You know, look at the baseball players that have taken stuff and look at us.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, they can't get that big.
*  They're not gifted for it.
*  Well, they wouldn't try either, right?
*  They weren't trying to get that big.
*  They're pretty fucking big.
*  They couldn't get that big as they wanted to.
*  Really?
*  So it's a small percentage of the population that could get that big.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  And probably like one percent that could get as big as I got.
*  And I was the only guy.
*  Nobody duplicated that sense.
*  And you would be in that condition.
*  Right. And be healthy.
*  Right.
*  I don't have any health problem.
*  Besides the, you know, the back.
*  The injuries.
*  The injuries. Yeah.
*  My liver and my kidneys and my heart is all good.
*  Did you while you were doing things, did you get frequent blood tests?
*  Every three to four months.
*  And the doctor would go over everything and make sure everything was fine.
*  Everything's always good.
*  That seems to be the big misconception about steroids is that people think steroids kill you.
*  And people think you're taking like tons of stuff.
*  I wouldn't take tons of stuff.
*  I probably wouldn't take no more than what those baseball players were taking.
*  Just working out more, lifting more, lifting harder.
*  Just working out, lifting more and gifted genetically for it.
*  Dorian Yates said basically the same thing.
*  Yeah.
*  It wasn't that he was taking a lot.
*  Yeah.
*  Compared to a lot of guys.
*  Yeah.
*  People think I was taking massive amounts of stuff.
*  If I'd been taking massive amounts of stuff, I wouldn't think I'd still be here.
*  I don't think I'd be as healthy as I am now.
*  Right.
*  You know,
*  besides my back surgery, neck surgery, I'm all good.
*  Like I said, my living, my kidneys and heart and everything still hold up real good.
*  Now, when you would get off for that three month period, would you cycle off of everything?
*  No, cold turkey.
*  Cold turkey.
*  Really cold turkey.
*  I didn't take anything or nothing.
*  And what did you feel like over those three months?
*  Normal.
*  Really?
*  No, it didn't bother me a bit.
*  So you just you got just great genetics, man.
*  Craziest ever.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, obviously, there's no way you could take all, you know, cold turkey.
*  I stopped everything one day.
*  I'll be taking, you know, a bunch of stuff.
*  Next day, nothing.
*  And your body would just feel normal.
*  Body felt normal.
*  Then bothered me a bit.
*  That's so crazy.
*  Didn't get depressed or nothing.
*  You know, yeah,
*  felt normal.
*  That's just yeah.
*  I still was strong.
*  Wow.
*  I can still, you know, squat, you know,
*  I can squat, you know, seven, eight hundred naturally.
*  Wow.
*  So you basically kept a lot of your gains.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I was still three hundred pounds, you know,
*  without taking all that stuff.
*  And so then after three months, then you was slowly ramped back up.
*  Slowly ramped back up.
*  Yeah.
*  And all this under doctor supervision.
*  All this under doctor supervision.
*  And all the while I'm getting my blood work done every three to four months.
*  So a lot of guys after they're done competing, then they have to get on
*  testosterone replacement therapy because the endocrine system is kind of messed up.
*  Exactly.
*  Did you have to do that as well?
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  It seems like that's just a part of the sport.
*  Yeah. Yeah, it is.
*  Yeah.
*  It's interesting, though, because, like, for the longest time,
*  these guys were doing these ads and magazines and they were attributing
*  everything to some supplement that they were selling or some creatine or some this.
*  You know, that stuff does something.
*  It helps you out a little bit, but it's not going to get you.
*  It's not going to get you 330 pounds with 3% body fat.
*  No.
*  No, it's definitely not going to do that.
*  Was that something that you were allowed to talk about while you were competing?
*  Uh, yeah.
*  I mean, did it come up?
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I'll talk about it.
*  I didn't
*  have no reason to hide it.
*  People because it seems like people were stupid.
*  They're not. No.
*  When you got that big.
*  Yeah.
*  But it seemed like there was an era where
*  bodybuilding kind of tried to pretend that they weren't taking that.
*  Yeah.
*  Because all those people committing suicide and kids taking all that stuff and
*  doing it the wrong way, you know,
*  not having it prescribed and all this kind of stuff.
*  Also, the more is better.
*  Like not getting bad stuff.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  But there were some guys that would just say, well,
*  the way to win is to take way more than everybody else.
*  Yeah.
*  And see what your body could tolerate.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. The more you take, the better you're going to be.
*  I knew a guy like that.
*  Yeah. And he wanted to have a heart attack.
*  Exactly. We used to call him garden hoses because his arms look like garden hoses
*  for veins. Yeah.
*  Just these giant veins all over his arms.
*  Didn't make sense.
*  But he was just on everything.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  But he didn't make it to 30.
*  Yeah. He died before he was 30.
*  Some people, yeah, they do it the wrong way.
*  Yeah. I didn't start taking anything until I was 30.
*  Really? Yeah.
*  Remember, I was
*  I was a drug free for a long time.
*  And I did everything naturally for a long, long time because I was, like I said,
*  gifted. Right.
*  What inspired you?
*  What made you decide when you were 30 that you had to do something?
*  I got tired of getting my ass kicked.
*  In competitions?
*  Yeah.
*  The highest I would place was like 30 or something.
*  You know, after a while, you know, you competitive.
*  You shit.
*  You
*  the other guy's got a competitive advantage on you.
*  So let's make this thing equal.
*  Is this something somebody suggested to you?
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  So people in the gym like, hey, Ronnie.
*  No, one of the competitors suggested that to me.
*  Oh, by the name of Flex Wheeler.
*  Oh, OK. Best friend in the world.
*  That guy was fucking huge, huge, huge.
*  He taught me everything I know.
*  Did he really? Yeah.
*  Mm hmm.
*  He also got me the best nutritionist ever.
*  That's how I won my first Olympia.
*  So is that how most guys find out about steroids from other guys who are competing?
*  If you were smart, that's the way you would do it.
*  Somebody that's
*  somebody that knows, yeah,
*  what they're doing and somebody that's successful at it, not some
*  dumb trainer that think they know.
*  Right.
*  You know, Flex had won major contest
*  and was a real experienced bodybuilder at the time.
*  You know, I'm still new to the sport.
*  Right. I didn't get into it until I was, what, 24.
*  I think he started probably when he was like 16, 17.
*  I never did that
*  because we didn't have it where I was from.
*  How much of a night and day difference was it once you started taking stuff?
*  Oh, as far as the condition, night and day.
*  Night and day and your ability to work, to put in work?
*  No, no.
*  The way the condition of your body.
*  Yeah. The only thing changed was conditioning.
*  What do you mean by strength didn't go up that much?
*  What do you mean by conditioning?
*  Oh, the way you looked?
*  Yeah, the way I looked.
*  So like leanness?
*  My definition and, you know, leanness and kind of that's the only thing really changed.
*  Well, your strength didn't go up that much.
*  My strength didn't go up that much.
*  I was still, I was deadlifting 750 pounds.
*  Wow.
*  You know,
*  because I was, you know, I was still doing powerlifting shows when I was doing bodybuilding.
*  Were you really?
*  Yeah. At the same time.
*  At the same time.
*  Yeah. That's pretty unusual, isn't it?
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  But, you know, that was something I loved to do.
*  But those powerlifting guys are usually quite a bit fatter.
*  They don't mind having a lot of body fat.
*  The more body fat you have, the stronger you're going to be.
*  Why is that?
*  Because you got more cushion around the muscle.
*  More water around the muscle.
*  And all that stuff makes you stronger, gives you more energy.
*  Really?
*  Especially if you're naturally gifted with strength.
*  So did you ever feel like,
*  was that ever pulling you back?
*  Like powerlifting?
*  Did you ever think about getting back into that again?
*  Or were you just completely committed to bodybuilding at that time?
*  After a while, I kind of just got committed to bodybuilding because I was
*  working full time in the police department, trying to do powerlifting, trying to do
*  bodybuilding, just too much.
*  And I had all these jobs, too.
*  I would do security at Denny's on Fridays and Saturday nights from the Toyota 4.
*  I would work in my apartment complex.
*  That might be the most dangerous spot in the world.
*  Denny's from 12 to 4 the weekend.
*  My first fight was at Denny's.
*  Oh, was it really?
*  My first one, the one that I used to force a fight against me, was at Denny's.
*  Yeah, Denny's can be rough at late night, drunks showing up to eat.
*  Yep.
*  It was a drunk guy.
*  That's of course.
*  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
*  You want to try to resist me?
*  Yeah.
*  Who the fuck is sober at Denny's at 3 o'clock in the morning?
*  Exactly.
*  Hardly nobody.
*  So when you were 30, you started taking
*  steroids and you won the Olympia for the first time when you were 34.
*  So that's like four years.
*  Yeah.
*  That's insane.
*  Yeah.
*  But you got to remember the base I had before that.
*  Right.
*  So it's base and hard work and also genetics.
*  It's the perfect storm.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you think as a bodybuilder, you really
*  need like the perfect storm of things to be a champion?
*  You do.
*  Yeah, you do.
*  You're not going to be it if you don't have it.
*  It's just like trying to be president of the United States.
*  You know, only certain people going to be president of the United States.
*  Everybody's not going to make it at that job.
*  Well, it's like when I look at some some Mr.
*  Olympias, it's so hard.
*  I'm looking at one, two, three and four.
*  I'm like, I don't I'm not.
*  You have to have an eye for it.
*  You have to be trained.
*  Yeah, because I used to be the same way.
*  I thought everybody looked the same.
*  Yeah, that's how I looked at my head.
*  I know exactly what you're talking about.
*  Yeah, they all about it.
*  Just big, huge.
*  Yeah, huge.
*  Yeah.
*  Everybody looks pretty.
*  I thought I could never ever attain it.
*  But you did.
*  I did.
*  Did you set the gold standard?
*  That crazy looking back is crazy looking back.
*  You ever wake up and just say, like, yeah, what the fuck did I do?
*  Look, I did.
*  Yeah, look.
*  Yeah.
*  Because when you're doing it,
*  you always in that mindset of doing it.
*  Yes.
*  You're not enjoying it.
*  Right.
*  You just can't you can't sit around and enjoy it.
*  Right.
*  You got to stay focused and dedicated.
*  You got to be always mindful.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, so there's no enjoying all that when you have success like that.
*  Well, I don't I think that mindset, too, is the only way you become a champion like
*  yourself, that just keep going, keep grinding mindset.
*  You don't enjoy anything.
*  Yeah.
*  You enjoy it later.
*  Yeah.
*  After it's all over with.
*  But I only enjoy it now.
*  There's such a small handful of Mr.
*  Olympias. I mean, that is the elite of the elite club to be in for bodybuilders.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you got to you got to have an amazing sense of satisfaction.
*  And a lot of guys that win it win it multiple times.
*  Yeah. Why is that?
*  Because it's only elite number of guys
*  can be Mr. Olympia.
*  And once you get there, you found the formula.
*  And it takes a while for somebody to come in and knock you off because nobody
*  found that formula like you have.
*  Now, I ate in a row for me, ate in a row for Lee Haney.
*  Yeah.
*  Seven for the Arnold,
*  six for Yates, Cutler four, you know, look at all those.
*  I mean, guys, I just named and how many years is that?
*  That's a lot of years.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, what a group of human beings.
*  Just me, Lee and
*  Arnold is 25 years almost.
*  Yeah, that's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  And three guys, 25 years.
*  When you say the right formula, it's the right amount of training,
*  the right amount of rest, the right amount of food, the right nutrition, all the above.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's hard to do.
*  Hard to dial it in.
*  It's hard to dial it in.
*  And did you dial it in with the help of a coach?
*  Nutritionist.
*  Just a nutritionist.
*  I couldn't have done it by myself.
*  But what about a coach?
*  Like the same thing.
*  But does the nutritionist maintain your schedule for your workouts as well?
*  Yeah. Well, I did my own workout schedule.
*  So you did that all yourself?
*  All myself. Yeah. He did all my other stuff.
*  So he did all the food, made sure your body is well, well fueled.
*  But all the weightlifting, all that was set up by you.
*  Yeah, that was me.
*  How did you know when it's enough and when it's not enough and when it's too much?
*  Well, you can only do so much.
*  You can only do what you can do.
*  You know your limitations and you know what you got to do.
*  So once you figure all this out,
*  that's your formula and that's what you take from year to year.
*  And that formula is based on your body.
*  Your body.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Everybody's body is different.
*  Did you ever have guys coming up to you?
*  I mean, you must have had guys coming up to you saying,
*  what's the what do I have to do to be like you?
*  All the time.
*  What did you tell them?
*  Oh, how personal trainer.
*  That's why I had, you know, I wasn't able to do all that on my own.
*  The guy who gave me the free membership to the gym, Brian Dawson,
*  the guy that taught me all this stuff,
*  he taught me how to pose.
*  He taught me how to train as a bodybuilder and not a powerlifter.
*  It's two different types of training.
*  He taught me everything I need to know.
*  And he was kind of like my personal trainer.
*  You know, if he wouldn't have taught me all that stuff, I wouldn't have knew nothing.
*  And so I always tell people, if you want to know something,
*  learn from somebody that knows all this stuff.
*  And that's how you get the right formula.
*  Was this guy with you throughout your whole career?
*  No, no.
*  Just the beginning, just to teach you the basics.
*  Yeah. And then from then on, it was all you.
*  Yeah.
*  I had to get other trainers and nutritionists.
*  I had some trainers and nutritionists that weren't that good along the way,
*  like a couple.
*  And I finally found the right guy from Flex Wheeler.
*  He turned me on to the guy who helped me win my first Olympia, Chad Nichols.
*  He's the guy that found the right formula for me.
*  And when you had this right formula, how many workouts a day were you doing?
*  One. Just one.
*  Yeah. Just one long workout.
*  Hour and a half. Hour and a half every day.
*  Hour, 15 minutes.
*  So it was really. Yeah.
*  So it's just about the intensity.
*  It's about the intensity.
*  And was there a time when you were working out more than that?
*  Never. You felt like it was too much?
*  No.
*  You just always had it dialed in?
*  Always had it dialed in.
*  Wow.
*  You know, I had to do two hours of cardio a day.
*  Two hours of cardio.
*  Hour in the morning, hour at night after I got off work.
*  Wow.
*  What kind of shit, like elliptical or something?
*  I did
*  stair master.
*  I would do the elliptical and the treadmill.
*  You would run on a treadmill?
*  Well, I ain't going to call it running.
*  I'm just thinking you're so big.
*  That's why I ain't going to call it running.
*  What did you do? Just kind of fast walking?
*  Yeah, like two, about three miles an hour.
*  Oh, OK, OK, OK.
*  Yeah, that makes more sense.
*  Yeah, for an hour.
*  An hour. So this is just to burn off the fat?
*  Yeah, exactly. Wow.
*  Goddamn, you must hate cardio now.
*  No, I still do it. You still do it?
*  Yeah. But I would imagine that that would be enough cardio for the rest of your fucking life.
*  Two hours a day, every day.
*  Like, oh, my God, if I never see another piece of cardio equipment again for the rest of my life.
*  I get used to it after a while, you know.
*  What do you do now?
*  I can only do, I do bike now.
*  I can walk on the treadmill, but I have to hold on.
*  Hold on to the handles.
*  So I don't do it. I just do the bike.
*  Yeah. Well, listen, man, after this show is over,
*  I'm going to connect you to Dr.
*  Neil Reardon, who is in Dallas, and I really hope that he can help you.
*  And it'll be great if you do it.

*  I guarantee that.
*  I believe you.
