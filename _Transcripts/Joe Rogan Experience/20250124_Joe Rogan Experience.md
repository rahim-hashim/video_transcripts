# Joe Rogan Experience #2262 - Dr. Mark Gordon
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6.0s)]
*  Good to see you again my friend. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=10.0s)]
*  Hey, it's always great to be here. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=15.0s)]
*  It's been a while. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=17.0s)]
*  Four years, January 8th, no, January 15th. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=19.0s)]
*  Was it really? Four years, geez. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=22.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's been four years. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=24.0s)]
*  The last time you were here, right? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=25.0s)]
*  Correct. I think the last two were here. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=27.0s)]
*  So that was like right after a couple months after I moved here. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=29.0s)]
*  Yeah, so almost exactly four years. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=32.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=35.0s)]
*  Well, waiting was great. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=36.0s)]
*  Waiting? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=39.0s)]
*  Waiting, I mean the time, four years, waiting to have another chat with you. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=40.0s)]
*  Because so much has gone on since last we met. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=45.0s)]
*  Well, tell me, what's going on? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=48.0s)]
*  Where do you want to start? A? Z? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=51.0s)]
*  Anywhere. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=53.0s)]
*  Anywhere. Let's see, you know, the family's expanding. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=54.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=58.0s)]
*  Which is great. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=59.0s)]
*  All three daughters have been married and each has a grandchild, which is making me feel old. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=60.0s)]
*  So I've ramped up, stepped up my hormonal treatment to keep me on edge because I want to be around a lot longer to take care of these kids or to be with the kids. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=67.0s)]
*  They're just 16 months, but they're still fantastic. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=75.0s)]
*  Unbelievable. I love it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=78.0s)]
*  That's great. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=79.0s)]
*  Absolutely love it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=80.0s)]
*  But in the world that I work in, in the medical arena, it's been expanding rapidly. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=81.0s)]
*  The new administration has a part to play in it, which is great. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=87.0s)]
*  But even before that, the number of results that we're having, the outcome from TBI, PTSD, and what have you, has been accelerating because of some of our testing that we do as well as our treatment that we've initiated. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=90.0s)]
*  That's changed since four years ago, since last time. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=107.0s)]
*  What have you added in the last four years? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=110.0s)]
*  Well, we've added a lot more neutropics, excuse me, not nutraceuticals, natural products into our regimen. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=112.0s)]
*  You know, I spent 16 years looking at the science behind things that can get into the brain and alter the inflammation that occurs in the brain. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=119.0s)]
*  The whole premise of everything that I've been doing for the last 30 years has been based upon inflammation in the brain. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=127.0s)]
*  And the inflammation is what stops all the chemistry and why we develop anger and, you know, problems. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=133.0s)]
*  I don't know if you saw the article, which is called Influence of Media on the Mental Health of America, which used to be called the Trump Derangement Syndrome, but I got so much backlash from having that title. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=140.0s)]
*  People wouldn't read it because of the title. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=151.0s)]
*  And it talks about how constant stress from the media, echo chambers, social media, reading all this bullshit, causes cortisol to go up. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=153.0s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=162.0s)]
*  And it shuts down a chemical that protects your brain called fractalcon. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=163.0s)]
*  And then it starts dumping all this inflammation and causes loss of serotonin. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=167.0s)]
*  So you become more depressed. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=172.0s)]
*  It causes loss of melatonin. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=173.0s)]
*  So you can't sleep. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=175.0s)]
*  Generates another group of chemicals that induce depression. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=176.0s)]
*  Yeah, it essentially generates this response in your body that prepares itself for a fight that never takes place. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=180.0s)]
*  Correct. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=187.0s)]
*  And then you're always thinking you're about to get into some sort of a physical altercation with an armed enemy coming over the top of the hill. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=188.0s)]
*  Vigilant states, just like our army goes through. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=196.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=198.0s)]
*  Constant stress. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=199.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=200.0s)]
*  And the thing, the army and a lot of these people that you've worked with is from IEDs and from blowing through doors and stuff like that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=201.0s)]
*  They get damaged to their pituitary gland. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=210.0s)]
*  You know, we've talked about it many, many times in the podcast. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=212.0s)]
*  But I think one of the misperceptions is, as you said, and I apologize for that, is that we think it's all due to pituitary gland, but it isn't. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=214.0s)]
*  In the work that we've been doing, it shows that when you have inflammation in the brain, regardless of how it's developed, whether or not it's IED or slip and fall, or as we've talked in the past, even wave runners, ski do's or skiing or water skiing, snow skiing, or going to the range. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=222.0s)]
*  The 50 caliber gunners. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=241.0s)]
*  What happens is it creates this inflammation that shuts off the ability of the brain to regulate the pituitary gland. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=243.0s)]
*  So you can do all the MRIs as they do at the VA. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=250.0s)]
*  And they see a normal pituitary gland and says, oh, pituitary is normal. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=253.0s)]
*  You've got PTSD. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=257.0s)]
*  But there's no radiological or neuroradiological procedure that will allow you to look at inflammation in the brain. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=258.0s)]
*  So they assume they can't find any structural damage that it has to be all psychiatric. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=266.0s)]
*  Sort of like when they used to have to diagnose CT after you're already dead. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=273.0s)]
*  Correct. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=277.0s)]
*  Isn't that how they're doing it now? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=278.0s)]
*  No, I think they can scan for it now. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=280.0s)]
*  There's a PET scan that can look for the tau protein. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=282.0s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=284.0s)]
*  So yeah, tau proteins, hyperphosphorylated tau becomes these NFTs, these neurofibral tangles, which is an interesting issue. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=286.0s)]
*  It's been part of my last year of deep dive trying to find out why is it that you develop CTE or the symptoms relative to CT? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=296.0s)]
*  Why is it that you develop the symptoms relative to Parkinson's or Alzheimer's or multiple sclerosis? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=305.0s)]
*  Well, it turns out that the biochemistry is all the same. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=312.0s)]
*  Something called beta amyloid, which is the hallmark for someone with Alzheimer's disease. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=315.0s)]
*  And then these tau proteins, hyperphosphorylated tau proteins that they call NFTs, that they circulate around the blood vessels. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=320.0s)]
*  And they create this intense inflammation. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=328.0s)]
*  And that intense inflammation causes loss of blood supply, damage to neurons. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=330.0s)]
*  And you develop it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=335.0s)]
*  So we've had, using our protocol, we have our six case of multiple sclerosis that was totally put into remission. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=338.0s)]
*  It took 90 days to put them in remission. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=347.0s)]
*  It was a lieutenant. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=350.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a video up on. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=352.0s)]
*  And what's the protocol that did that? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=354.0s)]
*  The protocol is the nutraceutical that drops the inflammation and replacing the hormones that are deficient that protect the brain. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=356.0s)]
*  What is in the nutraceutical? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=364.0s)]
*  In the nutraceuticals, there is quercetin. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=365.0s)]
*  You know about quercetin. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=369.0s)]
*  It's got EDA, DHA from omegas. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=371.0s)]
*  It has in it glutathione, N-acylcysteine. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=378.0s)]
*  It's got B12. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=381.0s)]
*  That's one component of it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=383.0s)]
*  The other component has B1, B2, which deals with neurocommunication. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=385.0s)]
*  And then it's got PQQ and CoQ10. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=390.0s)]
*  PQQ is a form of CoQ10. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=393.0s)]
*  It's a sister. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=395.0s)]
*  And it's 100 to 1,000 times stronger. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=396.0s)]
*  But it's what it does. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=399.0s)]
*  It increases mitochondrial function. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=401.0s)]
*  I know you've had a lot of people here talking about mitochondrial function. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=403.0s)]
*  And that's a major piece in how to reverse things like neurodegenerative diseases and improve mental functioning. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=406.0s)]
*  I mean, products like you have, like AlphaBrain, you know, has an effect on improving mitochondrial function. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=414.0s)]
*  And that's what you want to do. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=422.0s)]
*  That's a key. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=423.0s)]
*  So you have to drop the inflammation because inflammation causes mitochondria that produce ATP. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=424.0s)]
*  It causes mitochondrial dysfunction. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=430.0s)]
*  So in all those neurodegenerative diseases, mitochondrial dysfunction has been ignored in the past. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=432.0s)]
*  And you need to address it. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=440.0s)]
*  So PQQ and CoQ10 are two very, very potent. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=442.0s)]
*  They add it together. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=446.0s)]
*  They stimulate mitochondrial ATP production and replication of mitochondria. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=448.0s)]
*  Quercetin does the same thing. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=454.0s)]
*  That's why it's so important. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=456.0s)]
*  So... [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=457.0s)]
*  Quercetin, you were explaining to me before that it's an ionophore. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=458.0s)]
*  Correct. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=461.0s)]
*  And that it gets ions into the bloodstream better. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=462.0s)]
*  So it's when you consume it with zinc. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=464.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=467.0s)]
*  This is a paid advertisement for better help. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=468.0s)]
*  Life is kind of like a book. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=471.0s)]
*  And every new year is the start of a new chapter. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=473.0s)]
*  Except in this case, the pages are blank. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=475.0s)]
*  And you can write whatever the fuck you want. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=478.0s)]
*  Maybe you're working towards buying a new home. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=480.0s)]
*  Maybe you want to learn how to garden or pick up hunting. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=483.0s)]
*  Or maybe you want to work on your relationships. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=486.0s)]
*  However you want your story to play out, it's going to take work, dedication, and a little bit of help. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=488.0s)]
*  Even the greatest authors have an editorial partner to bounce ideas off. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=494.0s)]
*  And that's nothing to be ashamed about. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=499.0s)]
*  If you need some help living the life you want, therapy is always a great place to start. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=501.0s)]
*  Therapy is for everyone, not just people who've gone through a major trauma. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=506.0s)]
*  It can teach you valuable skills like how to cope with stress, how to communicate better, how to set boundaries, and more. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=510.0s)]
*  One of the best ways to get into therapy is better help. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=518.0s)]
*  It's entirely online. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=521.0s)]
*  So it's easy to get started and more affordable too. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=522.0s)]
*  And as the largest online therapy provider in the world, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=526.0s)]
*  BetterHelp can provide access to mental health professionals with a diverse variety of expertise. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=530.0s)]
*  Write your story with BetterHelp. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=536.0s)]
*  Our listeners get 10% off their first month at betterhelp.com slash JRE. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=538.0s)]
*  That's better, H-E-L-P, dot com slash JRE. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=544.0s)]
*  But that's one. That's one of its functions. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=549.0s)]
*  But there are five functions that it has. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=553.0s)]
*  Kerstin is amazing. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=555.0s)]
*  It's an ionophore, which is when we talked about COVID and zinc. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=556.0s)]
*  It carries zinc into the cell to shut down the ability of the COVID, SARS, from replicating. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=560.0s)]
*  Or any virus, essentially, right? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=566.0s)]
*  Well, it works with SARS, and it works with influenza A and B. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=567.0s)]
*  It works with rhinovirus and enterovirus gut viruses that you can get during summertime. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=571.0s)]
*  So what I was just getting at is it's beneficial for people all year round, not just people that think they might be getting COVID. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=577.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=583.0s)]
*  So I take 500 milligrams twice a day. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=584.0s)]
*  Of quercetin and how much zinc with that? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=587.0s)]
*  Of course, 30 milligrams. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=589.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=590.0s)]
*  I take 30. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=591.0s)]
*  And you do that twice a day? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=592.0s)]
*  I do that, the quercetin, twice a day. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=593.0s)]
*  But zinc, because my levels are where they're at, I don't put a lot of zinc in. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=596.0s)]
*  Because zinc's involved in about 300 processes in the body. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=601.0s)]
*  It's antiviral that we just talked about. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=604.0s)]
*  It's anti-alzheimer's because it turns out that the production of the chemical called beta amyloid, there's an enzyme that regulates it. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=607.0s)]
*  And it's zinc dependent. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=616.0s)]
*  So if it's working, it's called a secretase. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=618.0s)]
*  It's called alpha secretase. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=621.0s)]
*  It's zinc dependent. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=623.0s)]
*  Beta secretase is not. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=624.0s)]
*  So beta secretase takes and makes the beta amyloid that causes the Alzheimer's, the inflammation. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=626.0s)]
*  And with that inflammation, you then start getting the same thing in CTE. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=633.0s)]
*  So in all these inflammatory conditions, they have the same beta amyloid and cause for CTE, the hyperphospholated tau protein that we call NFTs, neurofibril tangles. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=638.0s)]
*  So they're all related. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=653.0s)]
*  So what quercetin does is it increases mitochondrial replication in about seven days, doubles the amount of mitochondria intracellular. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=654.0s)]
*  It helps increase and deliver something called IGF binding protein three, insulin-like binding protein three. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=662.0s)]
*  Binding protein three is always looked at as being the carrier for IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor, growth hormone, turns on and delivers the production of insulin-like growth factor, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=670.0s)]
*  which is the main below-the-neck growth factor for our body, improves protein synthesis, decreases inflammation too. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=681.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=690.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=691.0s)]
*  As side track, when you're talking about beta amyloid and Alzheimer's, wasn't there a significant amount of fraud that was exposed about Alzheimer's studies that put into question a lot of the ideas that people had about Alzheimer's? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=692.0s)]
*  Wasn't that something that happened recently? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=709.0s)]
*  Well, in the train of thought on Alzheimer's, you know, they're saying that it's due to the recessive genes. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=711.0s)]
*  Well, if you look at the real studies recently, 95 percent of the cases of Alzheimer's disease appear to be due to trauma and aging. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=720.0s)]
*  Trauma and aging. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=730.0s)]
*  Only five percent. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=732.0s)]
*  So trauma, like head trauma? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=733.0s)]
*  Head trauma. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=735.0s)]
*  Because what happens is trauma stimulates the brain because of inflammation to increase the production of beta amyloid. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=736.0s)]
*  And it's because there's, they found recently another secretase. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=744.0s)]
*  What secretases are, are the enzymes that convert a protein called APP, Alzheimer's precursor protein. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=748.0s)]
*  And it's a long protein. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=758.0s)]
*  And two enzymes go in and clip it here and clip it here. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=761.0s)]
*  And that piece is beta amyloid. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=764.0s)]
*  That's the bad stuff. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=766.0s)]
*  That's a beta secretase and a gamma secretase. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=768.0s)]
*  But they also have something called alpha secretase. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=771.0s)]
*  So if alpha secretase and gamma secretase cut this APP, it generates alpha amyloid, which is inert, not inflammatory. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=774.0s)]
*  So what did they find recently? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=785.0s)]
*  Something called delta secretase. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=787.0s)]
*  Delta secretase and gamma gives you beta amyloid. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=790.0s)]
*  So how do you generate delta secretase in the body? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=795.0s)]
*  Trauma, aging. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=799.0s)]
*  So that's why most of the cases of Alzheimer's disease are inflammatory based. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=801.0s)]
*  So what are the things that... [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=809.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, but most cases, is there a certain age where people start to develop it? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=810.0s)]
*  And has there been any cases of very young people that get Alzheimer's? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=815.0s)]
*  There's a young form of Alzheimer's. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=818.0s)]
*  And that might be directly due to having had head trauma and developing this delta amyloid or delta secretase generating amyloid, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=820.0s)]
*  beta amyloid that creates the Alzheimer's disease. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=831.0s)]
*  As you get older, 65 years of age and above, that could be 5% genetic. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=834.0s)]
*  But I think what the literature is really speaking towards is that it all has an inflammatory basis. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=840.0s)]
*  Remember, trauma in the brain equates out to inflammatory processes. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=847.0s)]
*  It's part of the brain's ability to try and protect us. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=852.0s)]
*  Okay? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=855.0s)]
*  Remove junk, bacteria, mold, viruses from the brain, and also metabolites of abnormal metabolism in the brain. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=856.0s)]
*  What was the scandal? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=865.0s)]
*  The Alzheimer's research scandal? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=867.0s)]
*  Because it was pretty significant. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=869.0s)]
*  It was pretty significant, and they were saying that it throws into question all of these previous assumptions and therapies [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=870.0s)]
*  that they were providing for Alzheimer's disease. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=877.0s)]
*  And this person had made a significant amount of money. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=879.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's the antibodies. It's the treatment protocols, the antibodies against beta amyloid. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=883.0s)]
*  And they found that even though you were against beta amyloid, you were still progressing on to develop symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=890.0s)]
*  But they were talking about fraud. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=898.0s)]
*  This was like fraud in scientific research. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=900.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is recent. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=903.0s)]
*  How a retracted paper affected the course of Alzheimer's research. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=904.0s)]
*  But it's one paper, and what was the focus of? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=908.0s)]
*  Okay. June 2024 landmark Alzheimer's research was retracted due to fraud allegations. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=910.0s)]
*  Do we waste billions of dollars and thousands of hours of scientist time? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=917.0s)]
*  Maybe not. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=921.0s)]
*  New potentially hopeful drugs on the market targeting the subject of the paper amyloid beta. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=922.0s)]
*  The review video breaks down the amyloid beta hypothesis, the fraud itself, and where we go from here. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=928.0s)]
*  So what is the fraud itself, Jamie? Does it say? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=933.0s)]
*  So you can find an article that's just not a video, not attached to a video. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=936.0s)]
*  Well, beta amyloid data. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=939.0s)]
*  See, they've been relying on beta amyloid as being the focus. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=941.0s)]
*  And what they're finding is the treatment that addresses beta amyloid, the antibody against beta amyloid, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=944.0s)]
*  People are still getting progression of the disease. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=950.0s)]
*  I understand this, but I just want to know what the fraud was. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=953.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=956.0s)]
*  So what is the fraud? Amyloid hypothesis. Scroll down a little bit, Jamie. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=957.0s)]
*  What's the fraud? Where does it get to the what? What did the paper bullshit about? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=961.0s)]
*  Putting it into perspective. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=966.0s)]
*  Mm hmm. Okay. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=968.0s)]
*  What 56 paper lead to? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=972.0s)]
*  But later posted failed to find. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=976.0s)]
*  Where's the fraud? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=979.0s)]
*  What's it say? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=983.0s)]
*  Let me try a different search. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=985.0s)]
*  Yeah, just find out like what was the for this seems like very involved. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=986.0s)]
*  This is a science journal. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=990.0s)]
*  Well, you know that in there are papers that have been written about reproducibility. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=992.0s)]
*  Reproducibility is where a researcher does a paper, makes a claim about the results of his science. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=998.0s)]
*  And then people look at that and they want to go and reproduce it to prove it. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1005.0s)]
*  They found that 70% of them can't be reproduced. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1010.0s)]
*  And when you looked at the actual scientists who did the original work, goes back and tries to reproduce it. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1013.0s)]
*  Seven percent failure rate. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1018.0s)]
*  So there are major publications that have talked about this reproducibility error. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1020.0s)]
*  I mean, you can go on to Google Scholar or else into Google and look at reproducibility. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1025.0s)]
*  OK, here it is. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1032.0s)]
*  But over the past two years, questions have arisen about some of Matt Massilla. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1033.0s)]
*  How do you say his name? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1038.0s)]
*  Masilla. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1040.0s)]
*  Massilla. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1041.0s)]
*  You were great. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1042.0s)]
*  Massilla. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1043.0s)]
*  Massilla. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1044.0s)]
*  Massilla is a research. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1045.0s)]
*  Science investigation has now found that scores of his lab studies at UCSD and NIA are riddled with apparently falsified Western blots. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1046.0s)]
*  Images used to show the presence of proteins and micrographs of brain tissue. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1054.0s)]
*  Numerous images seem to have been inappropriate, really reused within the within and across papers, sometimes published years apart in different journals describing divergent experimental conditions. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1059.0s)]
*  After science brought initial concerns about Massilla's work to their attention, the neuroscientists and forensic analysis specializing in scientific work would previously work with science, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1072.0s)]
*  produced a 300 page dossier revealing a steady stream of suspect images between 1997 and 2023 at 132 of his published research papers. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1084.0s)]
*  Science did not pay them for their work. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1094.0s)]
*  In our opinion, this pattern of anomalous data raises credible concern for research misconduct and calls into question a remarkably large body of scientific work. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1096.0s)]
*  OK, so it seems like the fact that he was reusing the same images, stating that they were new images. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1107.0s)]
*  So he was stacking the deck in his favor, right, because he had a point to make that that's so gross. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1115.0s)]
*  Two point six billion dollars. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1123.0s)]
*  That's what the budget was. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1125.0s)]
*  That's National Institute of Health. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1127.0s)]
*  Yeah, she dwarfs the rest of the National Institute, the NIA combined. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1128.0s)]
*  He was in charge of the division of neuroscience. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1134.0s)]
*  That is so crazy. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1136.0s)]
*  So the budget of the division of neuroscience alone was two point six billion dollars in the last fiscal year. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1137.0s)]
*  And this guy was a key leader for the effort. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1143.0s)]
*  Man, how gross. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1149.0s)]
*  But that's pressure and competition and very ambitious people who have shitty morals. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1152.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's what that is. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1157.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1158.0s)]
*  Publisher perish. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1159.0s)]
*  Publisher perish is the motto, right? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1160.0s)]
*  That's the motto. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1162.0s)]
*  If they don't publish and have a positive finding, they're not going to get funding for the next project that they have. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1163.0s)]
*  And when someone does publish, like this gentleman who allegedly published falsified data, is there someone who goes over that stuff to make sure that that's not the case? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1168.0s)]
*  Yeah, the editors of the journal that he's presenting it to. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1178.0s)]
*  Right. But is there preferential treatment for people that are established scientists that are thought to be beyond criticism? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1182.0s)]
*  Theoretically. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1190.0s)]
*  Like a gentleman like this who has an enormous position of power and a two point six billion dollar budget behind him? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1191.0s)]
*  Well, but look at the bottom line. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1195.0s)]
*  Which pharmaceutical company was involved in it? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1197.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1200.0s)]
*  Which pharmaceutical? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1201.0s)]
*  And, you know, that's one of the problems that, you know, RFK Jr. will be generating is that as he finds that this science is 70 percent, you can't reproduce it, meaning that it's maybe not accurate. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1203.0s)]
*  Maybe there's a little bit of bias. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1220.0s)]
*  That's being kind. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1222.0s)]
*  I'm trying to be kind. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1223.0s)]
*  Yeah, because otherwise it's fraudulent, right? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1225.0s)]
*  It is, correct. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1227.0s)]
*  I was just reading an article about Alzheimer's that was claiming that Alzheimer's didn't even exist until modern times. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1228.0s)]
*  Statins. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1234.0s)]
*  Statins cause Alzheimer's? Is that what you're saying? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1235.0s)]
*  This article was connecting it to our diet, the standard American diet. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1238.0s)]
*  And they were saying that all the bullshit food that people eat is contributing to this condition. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1243.0s)]
*  And what I was going to get to you is that would lead to inflammation, correct? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1249.0s)]
*  You got it. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1253.0s)]
*  Because the bullshit American diet filled with crap is terrible for you. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1254.0s)]
*  And that leads to inflammation. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1258.0s)]
*  You look at the inflammatory neurodegenerative diseases. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1260.0s)]
*  What does everyone have now? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1263.0s)]
*  It says a low inflammatory diet. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1265.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1268.0s)]
*  That's what it talks about. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1269.0s)]
*  And also in HIIT, in high-impact interval training, in high-impact aerobics, what happens is you can increase a chemical in the brain called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1270.0s)]
*  which is something that helps to improve neuron-to-neuron communication and neurology of your brain. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1280.0s)]
*  And I don't know if you saw, we have one of your favorite guys, Gerald McClellan. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1288.0s)]
*  I don't know if you've seen some of the papers that have come out. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1293.0s)]
*  He had a stroke in 95 fighting Nigel Ben in London. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1296.0s)]
*  And during that fight, it was a horrible fight if you've ever seen the... [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1302.0s)]
*  It's a crazy fight. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1306.0s)]
*  So anyway, he had a stroke from that and was hospitalized for 11 days in a coma in ICU in London. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1307.0s)]
*  Gets out, his sister Lisa McClellan refuses to put him into a nursing home, into a hospice health, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1315.0s)]
*  takes him into the house in Chicago and for 29 years dealt with him. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1322.0s)]
*  She develops an organization called Ring of Brotherhood where Muhammad Ali's niece and son are, I think, a part of it. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1326.0s)]
*  And they take care of boxers who are leaving the ring who have symptoms, punch drunk or what do they call it, precox or pugilistic, dementia pugilistic. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1335.0s)]
*  Pugilistic, yeah. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1346.0s)]
*  And she contacted me and told me about her brother and I looked at stuff. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1347.0s)]
*  And what we did was we set up a fund and we paid for his laboratory work and his initial assessment. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1354.0s)]
*  And we found he was hormonally deficient. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1360.0s)]
*  So what we ended up doing is putting him on to the hormone replacement and to one of the peptides that we use, which is called NSEAL-CMAX, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1362.0s)]
*  which stimulates the brain to produce more brain derived neurotrophic factor. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1373.0s)]
*  He's in Chicago. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1378.0s)]
*  I'm in California or here in Texas, in Magnolia, and one of our docs in Chicago took the lead. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1380.0s)]
*  I just gave her what to do. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1387.0s)]
*  He's 20 percent better in four months on the protocol. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1389.0s)]
*  He's now remembering things. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1393.0s)]
*  He's communicating. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1395.0s)]
*  He's on the phone and a boxing journalist, Oliver Fennell, came from London to Chicago and wrote a paper which is called A Day in the Life of Gerald McClellan [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1396.0s)]
*  and talks about what happened and where he's gone. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1408.0s)]
*  And he's had some improvement. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1412.0s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1414.0s)]
*  Yeah, phenomenal. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1416.0s)]
*  20 percent improvement. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1417.0s)]
*  I'm sure we talked about Rick Perry before the podcast started. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1418.0s)]
*  So I'm sure you're aware of his push to legalize Ibogaine and start using Ibogaine for people with traumatic brain injuries. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1422.0s)]
*  And he was talking about how it regenerates neural tissue and helps people significantly. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1432.0s)]
*  And then on top of that, the addiction issue where people have addictions and Ibogaine is incredible for curing those, like literally curing them. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1437.0s)]
*  And one with one session is in the 80 percent range. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1447.0s)]
*  With two sessions, it's somewhere around 97 percent, which is just crazy. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1451.0s)]
*  93 to 97 percent. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1456.0s)]
*  It's phenomenal. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1457.0s)]
*  I give a lot of credit to Rick Perry. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1458.0s)]
*  In 2022, they had HB 1802, which is the first bill in any state where the state put money into a research project at Baylor for it was for a sole assignment. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1460.0s)]
*  That is where he started. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1476.0s)]
*  So it was Rick Perry. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1477.0s)]
*  Andrew Moore was part of it, along with Dr. Martin. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1479.0s)]
*  Shout out to our friend, Andrew. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1482.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1484.0s)]
*  Hello, Andrew. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1485.0s)]
*  And let's see, Dr. Martin Polanco, who I'll cycle back to because the Ibogaine issue is what he helped to develop. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1488.0s)]
*  So it was also Representative Alex Dominguez who helped to push it through to get the funding for it. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1496.0s)]
*  And it's at Baylor with a doctor by the name of Lynette Avril, PhD. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1503.0s)]
*  She's, I believe, the one who's in charge of it. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1509.0s)]
*  But recently, you know, we have ayahuasca. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1511.0s)]
*  We've got Ibogaine. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1514.0s)]
*  We got LSD. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1515.0s)]
*  We've got MNTA. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1516.0s)]
*  The Ibogaine seems to be really good for addiction and for neuro regeneration, which is what you were talking about, to improvement in the neuro function. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1518.0s)]
*  Downside is the cardiovascular. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1529.0s)]
*  So it has to always be under a very strict, very close observation. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1531.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1536.0s)]
*  And the doctor that I talked about, MD, Martin Polanco, who has clinics in Mexico, uses Ibogaine. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1537.0s)]
*  And one of our new vets who came on board in one of the other states set up a 508 charitable organization. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1546.0s)]
*  The eight is a religious organization. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1556.0s)]
*  He imports Ibogaine from I think it's Chile and gets it here in the states and then sends it to Mexico to Dr. Polanco to do studies. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1558.0s)]
*  So right now, I believe he has the largest group of studies. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1568.0s)]
*  And one of the things that really has to be looked at is the compassionate use of these products. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1572.0s)]
*  You've got guys that are coming back from war who everything isn't working, you know, everything. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1579.0s)]
*  So you have to start pulling the stops out and treat them. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1584.0s)]
*  I mean, if you really want them to get better, especially when there's real evidence that there's not just anecdotal evidence that they work, but there's actual scientific evidence of their effectiveness. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1588.0s)]
*  There's mechanisms. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1599.0s)]
*  There's mechanisms, we understand. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1600.0s)]
*  Right. So I think I might have sent you a preliminary paper I'm working on the neurotransmitters to identify how each one of the psychedelic assisted therapeutic agents work in the brain. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1602.0s)]
*  And the science is already out there. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1616.0s)]
*  So what does it tell you? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1618.0s)]
*  The foundation for how they work, why they work and how they work is already there. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1619.0s)]
*  So why aren't we using it? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1623.0s)]
*  Well, because of a stupid law that was passed in 1970 to punish Richard Nixon's political opponents. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1626.0s)]
*  That's really what it is. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1633.0s)]
*  Was it? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1634.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it is. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1635.0s)]
*  It was about the civil rights movement and the anti-war movement. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1636.0s)]
*  And so one of the ways to get at these people, they knew that one of the big shifts of culture, if you go back to like, we talk about it ad nauseam on the podcast, but there's just a gigantic shift in culture from the 1950s to the 1960s. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1639.0s)]
*  It's almost unimaginable the amount of change that takes place. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1653.0s)]
*  And what you have to imagine as a person today is 2015. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1656.0s)]
*  Now you think in time things accelerate even more rapidly and change is more exponential. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1661.0s)]
*  It's more crazy in time. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1667.0s)]
*  And it's kind of sort of true with some technologies, especially today with AI. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1669.0s)]
*  But if you go back to 2015 and if you were just driving around in 2015, everything is essentially the same. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1672.0s)]
*  The phones look pretty much the same. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1679.0s)]
*  The cars look pretty much the same. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1681.0s)]
*  There's not much difference. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1683.0s)]
*  There's not much difference in your life. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1684.0s)]
*  If you go from 1959 to 1969, you have a totally different fucking world. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1686.0s)]
*  You have a totally different world of culture, totally different world of movies, totally different world of music, totally different world of automobile design. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1692.0s)]
*  You have a totally different world that I believe is inspired by psychedelic drugs. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1701.0s)]
*  And when Nixon throws the water on the psychedelic movement in 1970 and makes them all schedule one, including things that aren't even psychoactive, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1707.0s)]
*  by the way, missed a bunch of really good ones, missed a bunch of really good ones that are still legal. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1716.0s)]
*  One of them was salvia, which is fucking bananas, an insanely potent psychedelic drug that was completely legal. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1721.0s)]
*  So if you look at it culturally, you see this shift. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1730.0s)]
*  You see the movies get clunkier and goofy. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1735.0s)]
*  You see the cars start to look like shit. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1738.0s)]
*  You see the music starts to suck. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1741.0s)]
*  It starts to be like real frivolous and very surface. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1743.0s)]
*  It's cocaine music, right? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1747.0s)]
*  It's not Led Zeppelin. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1749.0s)]
*  It's not psychedelic music. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1751.0s)]
*  It's not the doors. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1753.0s)]
*  It's not Hendrix. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1754.0s)]
*  It's not Voodoo Child. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1756.0s)]
*  It's something completely divorced from feeling. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1758.0s)]
*  And this is because of Richard Nixon. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1762.0s)]
*  So you're basically saying the importance of psychedelics in expanding the visions that we have to advance our culture and society has been removed. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1765.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1775.0s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1776.0s)]
*  We talked about the sympathetic use. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1777.0s)]

*  That actually doesn't taste bad at all. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1938.0s)]
*  I always get nervous when you're eating something out of a tube. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1939.0s)]
*  It depends on whose tube it is. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1942.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1945.0s)]
*  Isn't that true? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1946.0s)]
*  It's not actually a tube. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1947.0s)]
*  I don't know why I said a tube. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1948.0s)]
*  It's a packet, like a ketchup packet. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1949.0s)]
*  There you go. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1951.0s)]
*  It's not ketchup. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1952.0s)]
*  But it doesn't taste bad at all. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1953.0s)]
*  No. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1954.0s)]
*  You turned me on to glutathione a decade ago. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1955.0s)]
*  A decade plus. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1958.0s)]
*  13. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1959.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1960.0s)]
*  Long time ago. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1961.0s)]
*  Long time ago. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1962.0s)]
*  But because of meeting you, I really ramped up all of my nutritional supplements in a [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1963.0s)]
*  big way. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1969.12s)]
*  Because back then when I first met you, it had to be 15 years ago, right? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1970.12s)]
*  Somewhere around then? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1973.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1974.4s)]
*  At least. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1975.4s)]
*  When I first met you, I was just basically taking multivitamins. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1976.4s)]
*  I wasn't really strict about it. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1979.0s)]
*  And then when you started doing blood work and explaining things to me and breaking down [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1981.04s)]
*  the nutritional deficiencies, like you need niacin, you need this, you need that, and [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1986.24s)]
*  I started taking all that stuff, it makes a significant difference. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1990.32s)]
*  It really does. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1993.68s)]
*  And I talk to a lot of people that are skeptical about vitamins, and they talk to their doctors, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1994.68s)]
*  unfortunately. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1998.6399999999999s)]
*  And the reality is that you're very educated in this department, but many doctors have [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=1999.76s)]
*  a cursory at best understanding of nutrition. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2005.04s)]
*  Their specialty is their specialty. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2009.52s)]
*  If they're a urologist or they're an orthopedic surgeon, that's their specialty. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2011.76s)]
*  And most of them are very unhealthy, unfortunately. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2016.12s)]
*  Correct. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2018.96s)]
*  And they're under the illusion that you can get everything that you need to live optimally [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2019.96s)]
*  with a balanced diet. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2024.52s)]
*  That's horse shit, people. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2027.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2028.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2029.92s)]
*  And you notice it eventually. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2030.92s)]
*  Look, when I go on vacation, I've gone on vacation before, like seven day vacations, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2031.92s)]
*  and not taken vitamins with me. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2035.56s)]
*  You feel shitty. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2036.96s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2037.96s)]
*  I feel different. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2039.4s)]
*  Like at the end of seven days, I'm like, Jesus, I need some fucking vitamins. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2040.4s)]
*  So I don't do that anymore. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2042.96s)]
*  Now, when I go on vacation, I take vitamins with me. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2043.96s)]
*  I'm like, what's the big deal? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2046.16s)]
*  I pack underwear, pack my fucking vitamins, and I just make sure that I have everything [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2047.16s)]
*  that I need. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2051.7200000000003s)]
*  And if I don't do that, I don't feel the same. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2052.7200000000003s)]
*  And I think it's just the difference between being alive, do you need it to be alive? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2054.68s)]
*  No. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2059.44s)]
*  But we're not talking about just alive. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2060.44s)]
*  We're talking about optimization. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2062.04s)]
*  And if you want to feel better, and everybody does, you should take vitamins. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2064.2400000000002s)]
*  And you should take a bunch. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2068.84s)]
*  You should take a lot of different stuff. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2069.84s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2071.32s)]
*  One of the times you're talking about our progression throughout time, back in the 90s, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2073.04s)]
*  doctors were against vitamins saying that it's expensive urine, expensive flushing. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2081.2400000000002s)]
*  You remember that? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2086.92s)]
*  My doctor told me that. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2087.92s)]
*  Yeah, and then what happened? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2088.92s)]
*  And then all the science started coming out saying how we needed B12 because our nutrition [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2089.92s)]
*  because the soil not being rotated, devoid in the nutrients to feed the plants, to give [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2095.44s)]
*  us our... [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2100.04s)]
*  I thought B12 was essentially from animals. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2101.04s)]
*  It is, muscle. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2103.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2104.48s)]
*  From muscle. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2105.48s)]
*  But talking about B complex, really, you can get it in plants as well. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2106.48s)]
*  But it's the trace elements as well, the minerals. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2109.62s)]
*  And without having adequate amount in, you've got to replenish it. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2112.76s)]
*  And if you don't replenish it, you lose important pathways. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2116.44s)]
*  What about folks that are getting their food organically? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2121.16s)]
*  They go to a farmer's market, they get really good organic groceries. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2124.36s)]
*  Most of the organic people supplement the animals with quality supplementation food. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2128.48s)]
*  I mean organic vegetables. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2135.6400000000003s)]
*  Organic vegetables. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2137.6s)]
*  To be organic, you can't have pesticides on it, you can't have heavy metals, so it has [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2140.1200000000003s)]
*  to be nutritionally enriched with positive soil. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2144.6s)]
*  They might put at... [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2151.8s)]
*  They might put additives in it. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2153.2400000000002s)]
*  Ideally, you'd like just a natural process of compost and manure and stuff like that. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2154.6000000000004s)]
*  And that's where... [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2159.84s)]
*  I use chicken shit on... [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2160.84s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2162.44s)]
*  Chicken shit's great, right? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2163.44s)]
*  It works, yeah. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2164.44s)]
*  I've got some great lemons and vegetables. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2165.44s)]
*  Do you know that people used to go to war over bat shit? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2167.6400000000003s)]
*  Iguano, yes. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2170.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2171.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2172.44s)]
*  Isn't that nuts? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2173.44s)]
*  Iguano was so important for fertilizer. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2174.44s)]
*  Not only fertilizer, then it became the base foundation for lipstick and eyeliner. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2176.96s)]
*  What? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2182.76s)]
*  Bat shit was the foundation for lipstick? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2183.76s)]
*  Iguano. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2185.76s)]
*  Iguano. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2186.76s)]
*  You imagine kissing someone, they got bat shit lipstick on. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2187.76s)]
*  They had guano wars. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2189.76s)]
*  Yeah, they really did have guano wars. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2190.76s)]
*  Isn't that nuts? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2193.0s)]
*  Isn't that where bat shit crazy came from? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2194.0s)]
*  Crazy is bat shit, bat shit crazy. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2197.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2198.44s)]
*  I think the term bat shit crazy, I think that had something to do with how feverant people [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2199.44s)]
*  would fight in a war over bat shit. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2204.72s)]
*  Is it fervent? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2208.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2209.24s)]
*  Yeah, fervent. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2210.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good word. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2211.24s)]
*  I like bat shit. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2212.24s)]
*  There's a lot of words I don't use, but I read them. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2213.24s)]
*  Then when it's time to use them, I'm like, that's the appropriate road. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2215.24s)]
*  I'm like, how do you even fucking say that? [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2217.68s)]
*  That's where the term bat shit crazy came from. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2221.3999999999996s)]
*  It's one bizarre blink. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2223.3999999999996s)]
*  In one bizarre blink, guano ruled US agriculture and the world. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2225.3999999999996s)]
*  How fertilizer madness sparked into a third war and turned guano into gold. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2229.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2234.2s)]
*  People needed that for fertilizer. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2235.2s)]
*  Does it talk about the cosmetic use of guano? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2236.72s)]
*  Fountain of youth. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2240.8399999999997s)]
*  Bat shit's the fountain of youth? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2241.8399999999997s)]
*  What is it? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2246.2799999999997s)]
*  The nitrogen composition of it is very good for growth of plants. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2247.2799999999997s)]
*  This is interesting. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2251.4399999999996s)]
*  It says, prior to modern science and agriculture, the whys and hows of soil health largely were [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2252.4399999999996s)]
*  mysterious. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2257.52s)]
*  How soil additives functioned or the knowledge of which minerals were needed and when. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2258.64s)]
*  As the realm of the blind, beyond animal manure, farmers added soil amendments by the barrel, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2263.76s)]
*  composts, human waste, fish, coal bribe products, chalk, or whatever unholy concoction was hawked [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2269.5600000000004s)]
*  by the latest charlatan to pull up in a wagon at town's edge and promise a yield bloom. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2275.4s)]
*  Decade upon decade, the pitfalls of fertilization tormented growers until 1802 when German explorer [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2281.48s)]
*  and scientist Alexander von Humboldt strolled down a waterfront in Peru and felt his nose [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2287.0800000000004s)]
*  hairs curl in ammonia rebellion and an odor emanating from barge loads of yellow-brown [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2293.52s)]
*  cake guano. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2299.48s)]
*  Von Humboldt was told the stinking bird droppings covered the nearby Chincha Islands in deep [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2301.4s)]
*  layers and were massively popular with Peruvian farmers. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2307.44s)]
*  So this is interesting. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2311.8s)]
*  So that's how they started doing this. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2312.8s)]
*  So this is in the 1800s. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2313.8s)]
*  Can I read the next sentence? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2314.8s)]
*  Sure. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2316.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2317.32s)]
*  A little dabble, do ya? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2318.32s)]
*  Curiosity building the nostril-burning von Humboldt took home a scoop of guano to Europe [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2320.0s)]
*  and turned the spigot on agricultural fountain of youth, i.e. he sparked a fertilizer war. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2324.88s)]
*  You know what's the most interesting stuff about fertilizer? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2330.56s)]
*  It's shit to me. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2332.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2335.16s)]
*  Do you know that soil that they have in the Amazon that was created by man? [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2336.16s)]
*  No. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2341.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2342.64s)]
*  It's called terra preta. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2343.64s)]
*  And Graham Hancock told me about it. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2344.82s)]
*  There's a very specific soil in the Amazon that they think people from thousands of years [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2348.08s)]
*  ago figured out how to make. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2356.16s)]
*  And this is like some sort of a compost process. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2358.8s)]
*  And it's a very dark soil called terra preta. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2362.56s)]
*  And this dark soil that exists on the surface layer of a lot of the Amazon was put there [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2366.2s)]
*  by man. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2371.64s)]
*  And not just put there by man, but created. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2373.4s)]
*  That they had a process that they have not replicated to this day. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2376.04s)]
*  They don't know what it is or how they did it. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2378.84s)]
*  But they're very aware that there was a process involved in making this stuff and that it's [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2380.98s)]
*  not a natural process of this stuff forming. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2384.96s)]
*  At least that's what he said. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2387.56s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2389.16s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2390.16s)]
*  But let me show him some terra preta. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2391.16s)]
*  It's pretty fascinating. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2393.6s)]
*  So it's a dark, dark earth. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2394.6s)]
*  It's very interesting because you see it and you're like, this is, that's what it looks [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2397.96s)]
*  like. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2401.48s)]
*  So you see the terra preta is on the surface. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2402.52s)]
*  And then you go below it and you just get like regular dirt. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2405.42s)]
*  But this terra preta made everything very, very rich. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2408.32s)]
*  And it grew so much plants. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2412.8s)]
*  It's just like, do you know that the Amazon is mostly human planted plants that grew out [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2415.4s)]
*  of control? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2421.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2422.56s)]
*  Who planted it? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2423.56s)]
*  The original settlers of the Amazon. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2424.72s)]
*  This is the theory, right? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2426.66s)]
*  So they know now that the Amazon was heavily populated. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2428.36s)]
*  They didn't used to think that. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2433.08s)]
*  They used to think there was just this crazy wild jungle and there's indigenous populations [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2434.52s)]
*  to live inside of it. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2438.6600000000003s)]
*  Well, at one point in time there were cities. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2439.6600000000003s)]
*  So there's grids. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2441.76s)]
*  They found indications of some sort of transportation of water. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2442.8s)]
*  They had streets. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2448.84s)]
*  They had grids that indicate there were structures there all throughout from the use of LIDAR. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2450.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh, sure. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2455.92s)]
*  A satellite. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2456.92s)]
*  Well, it's from actually drones. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2458.48s)]
*  So they fly over with drones and they scan the area. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2459.76s)]
*  They probably could use satellites too, but they use drones. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2463.36s)]
*  They scan the air and even airplanes. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2466.2000000000003s)]
*  They scan the area and then they get these images that show these geometric patterns [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2468.04s)]
*  that exist below. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2473.12s)]
*  And so they've unearthed a lot of these. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2474.58s)]
*  And so now they think there were millions of people living in the Amazon and that what [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2476.48s)]
*  probably happened was Europeans came over and gave them all smallpox. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2480.94s)]
*  Yeah, that's the theory. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2485.08s)]
*  That's what killed everybody. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2486.72s)]
*  It was almost like they did with 90% of Native Americans. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2487.72s)]
*  But what was done there was done in a place where they had made this environment with [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2489.8799999999997s)]
*  terra preta and just because of the lush rainforest, it rains constantly and vegetation grows so [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2495.3599999999997s)]
*  well that as soon as they were gone, within a couple hundred years, everything's consumed [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2501.52s)]
*  by the jungle. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2505.8799999999997s)]
*  And then you lead thousands and thousands and thousands of years in the future, there's [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2507.16s)]
*  nothing left. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2511.08s)]
*  And that's what they think they're looking at when they're looking at these large sections [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2512.64s)]
*  of the Amazon that have these patterns and structures that indicate civilization. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2516.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2520.48s)]
*  It's pretty wild. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2521.48s)]
*  Yeah, I start my mornings looking at archaeology. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2523.0400000000004s)]
*  You do? [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2526.88s)]
*  Yeah, I look at archaeology, but the archaeology that I look at in LIDAR is in Europe because [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2527.88s)]
*  I collect ancient coins from Europe, from Italy and Germany and so forth and Spain. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2533.8s)]
*  And I've seen the photos where they go over and they see the foundation, as you said, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2540.48s)]
*  in the structures that are manmade structures. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2544.72s)]
*  So it's neat stuff. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2548.2s)]
*  It just makes you wonder how many of those exist out there in the Mexican jungles and [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2549.68s)]
*  in the Guatemalan jungles and that we don't even know about. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2555.08s)]
*  Toltecs, Aztecs, Mayan. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2557.8799999999997s)]
*  There's probably a ton of them back there. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2559.9199999999996s)]
*  There's probably a bunch of stuff because the Amazon is so huge and most of it is not [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2562.58s)]
*  explored. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2569.48s)]
*  Most of it is, there's a bunch of different uncontacted tribes that live in there. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2570.74s)]
*  In fact, my friend Paul Rosalie, do you know who Paul Rosalie is? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2575.54s)]
*  No. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2578.74s)]
*  Is he the one with the archaeology? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2579.74s)]
*  No. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2581.74s)]
*  He's essentially working to save the rainforest and what he does is he goes down there and [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2582.74s)]
*  he hires these people that were loggers to have a new job and the new job is to protect [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2588.2999999999997s)]
*  the forest instead. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2593.06s)]
*  And they've saved like shit, I don't know what the number is, but an incredible large [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2594.72s)]
*  number of acres they've saved this way and they continue to do this and they're trying [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2600.1400000000003s)]
*  to work with these people and try to stop them from just destroying the Amazon. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2603.5800000000004s)]
*  I think Sting donated a large amount of money to the Brazilian Amazon and a lot of entertainers [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2608.6600000000003s)]
*  who have donated a lot of money to protect it. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2614.9s)]
*  So my friend Paul, he runs into uncontacted tribes all the time. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2617.26s)]
*  Really? [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2620.78s)]
*  Many times. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2621.78s)]
*  I'd love to go there. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2622.78s)]
*  He sent me a video the other day that I can't share. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2623.78s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2625.02s)]
*  These uncontacted tribes, these naked people in the jungle in 2025. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2626.02s)]
*  It's really wild. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2631.2200000000003s)]
*  They live in isolation. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2632.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, isolation from what? [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2634.2200000000003s)]
*  From us. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2636.5800000000004s)]
*  From us. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2637.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, but they live the way people lived 100,000 years ago and I would, God, if I could be [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2638.5800000000004s)]
*  a fly on the wall. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2645.1400000000003s)]
*  Can you imagine the documentary? [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2646.5400000000004s)]
*  If we get really good at drones to the point where you can have a bunch of drones that [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2648.38s)]
*  do look like insects and fly them in there and film these folks. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2653.46s)]
*  But the problem then, people would want to go visit them. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2658.8599999999997s)]
*  And then they'd fuck everything up. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2661.06s)]
*  You have to keep it hidden like your video you were talking about. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2663.54s)]
*  That's the reason why he doesn't want the video to get out. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2667.8199999999997s)]
*  He doesn't want people to know that there's these people out there. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2669.98s)]
*  And there's a lot of them. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2673.42s)]
*  He said one of his friends was killed. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2674.8599999999997s)]
*  One of his friends was murdered by these people. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2677.22s)]
*  With the darts. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2680.66s)]
*  No, they got him with arrows. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2681.7799999999997s)]
*  With Carrara on it. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2683.66s)]
*  They could do that, but they shot him with bows and arrows. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2684.8199999999997s)]
*  They just fucking killed him. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2687.42s)]
*  And this was a guy that was giving them stuff too. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2689.58s)]
*  It's like he was bringing over rafts of food and they were like, you know what, today, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2692.14s)]
*  fuck you. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2696.58s)]
*  We killed a bunch of fish today. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2697.58s)]
*  We don't need your bananas. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2699.1s)]
*  Have you seen them where the ones, the Indians living in the Amazons, they're shooting down [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2700.94s)]
*  the monkeys for food. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2705.98s)]
*  Oh yeah, they love monkeys. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2709.14s)]
*  They don't need anything. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2710.2599999999998s)]
*  They've already established a culture of hunting, harvesting, and building their homes or building [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2711.6600000000003s)]
*  their towns. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2720.42s)]
*  You know what I found out recently? [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2721.42s)]
*  The term Indian is not because Columbus thought that he was in India. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2722.42s)]
*  I'd been told that in fucking high school. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2727.94s)]
*  So what is it? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2730.86s)]
*  It's the children of God. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2731.86s)]
*  What is the original term of Indios? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2734.6200000000003s)]
*  I forget the term, but it's not about India. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2737.66s)]
*  They called them Indians because they were the people that were living here in this place [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2745.54s)]
*  that they had named. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2749.62s)]
*  The indigenous. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2750.8999999999996s)]
*  But everybody thinks like America. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2751.8999999999996s)]
*  You think of Native Americans, we used to call them Indians because they thought Columbus [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2756.2999999999997s)]
*  landed in India. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2762.54s)]
*  Or he thought he landed in India. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2763.54s)]
*  Did he really? [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2765.2999999999997s)]
*  What's that? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2766.7000000000003s)]
*  It says that the Portuguese were Indios, but because Columbus was Portuguese. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2767.7000000000003s)]
*  Right, but there's a term though. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2772.1000000000004s)]
*  There's a term like the people of God. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2774.38s)]
*  The Portuguese were Indios. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2776.38s)]
*  That's what the AI said. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2778.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but there's another term. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2780.1800000000003s)]
*  Something that has to do with Indios. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2784.1800000000003s)]
*  See AI is wrong about stuff sometimes. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2786.46s)]
*  Where did the term? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2792.0600000000004s)]
*  I just typed in the word. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2794.9s)]
*  Just type in why are Native Americans called Indians. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2797.62s)]
*  That's not going to get you there either. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2802.2200000000003s)]
*  What was the? [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2805.98s)]
*  The origin of the word Indian. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2806.98s)]
*  So I was listening to this guy talk about this in a lecture. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2812.26s)]
*  I wish I saved it. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2815.5s)]
*  I absorb too much information and don't follow up through. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2817.54s)]
*  I'll go with our Reddit post. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2822.7s)]
*  Here's a small one. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2824.4199999999996s)]
*  What does it say? [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2825.4199999999996s)]
*  Always had the impression that we used the term Indian because Europeans were mistaken [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2826.4199999999996s)]
*  that they landed in India. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2830.1s)]
*  However, this HuffPost article explains that it wasn't possible that we used the term Hindustan [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2831.1s)]
*  for India. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2836.06s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2837.06s)]
*  And that Europeans used the term Indio earlier on, which had morphed into Indian. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2838.14s)]
*  That's right. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2843.18s)]
*  It was Indio. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2844.18s)]
*  So click on the HuffPost article. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2845.18s)]
*  The name Indian and political correctness. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2846.18s)]
*  2007. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2848.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2849.46s)]
*  Well, this guy was, it was a lecture this guy was giving. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2851.06s)]
*  Whoever wrote this could be the guy that gave the lecture. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2854.62s)]
*  Could be. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2858.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2859.06s)]
*  Could be. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2860.06s)]
*  What is he saying? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2861.06s)]
*  What's his term? [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2863.5s)]
*  Because there was something, there was something that had to do. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2864.5s)]
*  That's right. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2869.66s)]
*  Los Ninos in Dios. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2870.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2872.2200000000003s)]
*  Who called them Los Ninos. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2873.2200000000003s)]
*  Spelling may be wrong. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2875.1s)]
*  The Children of God. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2876.1s)]
*  The description by the Padre means something like the Children of God. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2877.34s)]
*  After many years of use, the word Indios emerged and to this day the indigenous people of South [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2880.42s)]
*  and Central America are called Indios. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2885.3s)]
*  So this is what this guy was saying. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2888.1400000000003s)]
*  So it said, stop, scroll back, go back. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2889.5s)]
*  So it said, here I'm a firm believer that most historians are wrong when they credit [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2894.06s)]
*  Christopher Columbus for corning the word Indian because he thought he was landing his [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2897.46s)]
*  ships in India. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2900.98s)]
*  By 1492, there was no country known as India. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2901.98s)]
*  Instead, that country was called Hindustan. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2905.06s)]
*  I think that it's closer to the truth that Spanish Padre that sailed with Columbus was [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2907.7400000000002s)]
*  so impressed by the innocence of the natives, he observed that he called them Los Ninos [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2911.42s)]
*  in Dios. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2916.18s)]
*  Meaning spelling may be wrong in the Spanish words, but the description by the Padre means [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2918.14s)]
*  something like the Children of God. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2921.86s)]
*  After many years of use, the word Indios emerged and to this day the indigenous people of South [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2924.02s)]
*  and Central America are called Indios. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2929.18s)]
*  I'm told that as the word wound its way north, it evolved into Indian. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2931.94s)]
*  Of course, some will say that there was a place in the East Indies in 1492 and Columbus [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2938.34s)]
*  may have thought he was headed for that region. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2943.6200000000003s)]
*  So how and when did the effort to politicize the name start? [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2946.38s)]
*  In fact, some of it started when Native Americans enrolled in some of the white colleges. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2949.38s)]
*  I think they found the word Indian offensive and set about to remake it. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2954.3s)]
*  They found that the word Indian was often used in a derogatory fashion such as drunken [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2959.02s)]
*  Indian or rotten Indian. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2964.2200000000003s)]
*  Perhaps the white people would have found it more difficult to say drunken Native American. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2966.9s)]
*  Yeah, those white people. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2970.82s)]
*  Yeah, those dirty white people. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2972.86s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2974.62s)]
*  Their problem. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2975.62s)]
*  And finally, when some Indian journalists made it to the newsrooms of large and prestigious [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2976.62s)]
*  mainstream newspapers, they reacted to the word Indian as they did when they were in [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2980.78s)]
*  college. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2985.66s)]
*  They responded to their editors and tried to impress upon them. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2986.66s)]
*  The paper should no longer use the word Indian, but instead switch to Native American or Native. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2988.8999999999996s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2994.2599999999998s)]
*  The problem even with Native American is Native for how long? [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=2995.2599999999998s)]
*  So like, if you believe the Bering landmass theory that they came across that way, that [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3002.94s)]
*  a lot of Native Americans, and this was actually tested because of Mormons. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3009.58s)]
*  So there was a wealthy Mormon who spent a bunch of money on DNA testing for Native Americans [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3014.66s)]
*  because he was sure that it was going to show that they were from the lost tribe of Israel. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3019.22s)]
*  Because he believed that the Mormon teaching is that the Indians and Native Americans are [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3025.8999999999996s)]
*  lost tribes of Israel. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3031.62s)]
*  But then he found out when they did the DNA testing, no, they're from Siberia. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3033.3399999999997s)]
*  Like a lot of them are from Siberia. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3037.22s)]
*  So that would make sense. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3039.5s)]
*  So they crossed the Bering land bridge, their ancestors did, and they wound up in North America. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3041.34s)]
*  Well, my people came from Communist Podolsk in Russia. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3045.34s)]
*  That's connected. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3049.62s)]
*  Yeah, it was from there, from Siberia. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3050.62s)]
*  Yeah, we bought Alaska for like 50 bucks. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3053.02s)]
*  That was like the deal of a lifetime. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3055.46s)]
*  The end of the century. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3057.46s)]
*  Manhattan might be the better deal. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3058.98s)]
*  Like financially, it's worth a lot more. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3060.62s)]
*  But goddamn, Alaska is bigger than Texas. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3062.82s)]
*  Alaska is huge. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3064.5s)]
*  And you've gone there hunting, right? [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3066.38s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3067.66s)]
*  I've gone there a few times. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3068.66s)]
*  It's an incredible place. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3070.46s)]
*  Alaska is incredible. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3071.46s)]
*  It's really wild. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3072.86s)]
*  Like that's the last real frontier. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3075.1s)]
*  If you want to get away, move to a small town in Alaska and go live next to Sarah Palin. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3077.02s)]
*  I can see Russia from there, so I should become Secretary of State. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3083.22s)]
*  Remember when she said that? [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3086.7s)]
*  You can see Russia, but you can't even see the rest of Alaska. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3087.7s)]
*  Alaska is huge. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3092.26s)]
*  What are you saying? [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3093.42s)]
*  I loved it there. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3095.46s)]
*  It's gorgeous. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3096.46s)]

*  I love the people. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3098.94s)]
*  The people are just different. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3101.46s)]
*  They're just rugged people. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3102.46s)]
*  They're more reliable. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3104.26s)]
*  They're built better. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3105.26s)]
*  You know how certain gene expressions are turned on and off due to stress. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3107.1s)]
*  Imagine their genes. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3114.5s)]

*  in what's now Levesque, California. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3164.5s)]
*  They named the town after him. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3166.7000000000003s)]
*  And it's right outside of Tahoe Ranch. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3168.86s)]
*  I'll have to show you the pictures. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3170.82s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you what it is. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3172.38s)]
*  It's called a color-faced bear. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3173.5800000000004s)]
*  So it's a different bear. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3175.3s)]
*  So there's a brown bear, which is a grizzly bear and the Kodiak bear and those bears. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3177.82s)]
*  But they're all the same bear. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3185.94s)]
*  The difference between a grizzly bear and a brown bear is just mostly what they eat. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3187.82s)]
*  So the brown bears in Alaska have so much salmon that they have immense amounts of protein [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3192.26s)]
*  and they're the largest of all the brown bears. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3197.34s)]
*  They're fucking huge. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3199.46s)]
*  They're much, much, much, much bigger than a black bear. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3201.42s)]
*  We had Parks and Rangers come to our house because one of our refrigerators failed. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3204.78s)]
*  So we had all this great beef in there so I had to throw it out. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3210.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh and the bears found it. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3214.1400000000003s)]
*  The next day the bears found it. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3215.54s)]
*  It was in a canister and they came there. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3217.62s)]
*  So I took videos of these, what I thought were brown bears coming in. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3220.1s)]
*  So you're saying they're not. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3224.58s)]
*  What's the... [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3226.3s)]
*  No, they're brown color-faced. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3227.3s)]
*  So brown bears can be, excuse me, black bears. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3228.9s)]
*  Black bears can be brown. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3233.16s)]
*  Most of them are black. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3235.3s)]
*  Some of them are even blonde. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3236.54s)]
*  There's blonde color-faced bears that they find up in Alberta. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3238.7400000000002s)]
*  But they're black bears. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3242.14s)]
*  So a black bear is less aggressive than a grizzly bear. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3243.7s)]
*  A grizzly bear is a brown bear and they were killing so many people in California that [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3247.2999999999997s)]
*  they wiped them out. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3250.7s)]
*  That's what happened. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3252.22s)]
*  Well this one jumped over a six-foot fence. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3253.22s)]
*  But before it jumped over the six-foot fence it ended up eating chicken and filet mignon [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3254.8599999999997s)]
*  and rib eye and everything. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3260.8999999999996s)]
*  The only thing it didn't eat was the garlic naan. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3262.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, tell you what, that bear's going to be back. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3265.8599999999997s)]
*  It came back three times. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3269.86s)]
*  On the third time, Parks and Recreation came by with a dart gun to try and put it down [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3271.42s)]
*  so that they can transport it to someplace else. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3277.42s)]
*  Did they get it? [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3279.6600000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3280.6600000000003s)]
*  It jumped over the fence. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3281.6600000000003s)]
*  I've never seen a bear jump six feet. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3282.6600000000003s)]
*  Oh, they can move, man. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3285.1s)]
*  It was 250 pounds at least is what they said. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3286.1s)]
*  Oh, they can move. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3288.78s)]
*  They move very, very, very fast. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3289.78s)]
*  It was unbelievable. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3291.3s)]
*  You'd be amazed at how fast they can move. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3292.3s)]
*  Like when they're chasing after another bear or something's happening, they move very fast. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3294.5s)]
*  It jumped into our swimming pool. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3300.1400000000003s)]
*  In Pasadena they have a lot of those. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3304.5400000000004s)]
*  In Pasadena? [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3306.7400000000002s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3307.7400000000002s)]
*  There's a funny video of this guy in Pasadena. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3308.7400000000002s)]
*  He's walking down a street and he turns into Ali and he's just staring at his phone. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3310.82s)]
*  He's walking with his phone and this guy gets within 30 feet of a fucking bear. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3315.38s)]
*  Wow. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3319.6200000000003s)]
*  See, you can find it. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3320.6200000000003s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3321.78s)]
*  I was like 10 feet away. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3322.78s)]
*  It's Pasadena, like in full-on Pasadena, not like the outskirts and the bush. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3323.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3329.7400000000002s)]
*  No, like actual street, city street in Pasadena, black bear. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3330.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so what do you do when it's looking you face to face? [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3334.5s)]
*  Well, you usually make a noise and try to startle it and frighten it and get the fuck [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3337.9s)]
*  out of there. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3342.98s)]
*  You yell at it. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3343.98s)]
*  Like, hey bear. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3344.98s)]
*  You say, hey bear. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3345.98s)]
*  That's what people do. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3346.98s)]
*  They say, hey bear. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3347.98s)]
*  The thing is bears that have been accustomed to people, so that right there is a black [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3348.98s)]
*  bear. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3352.1400000000003s)]
*  The one that I saw, and I think I might have it on my cell phone, but it was lighter than [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3353.5s)]
*  that. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3359.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, like I said, they get even blonde. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3360.2599999999998s)]
*  So that's a brown, black, that's a color-phase black bear. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3362.18s)]
*  Intimidating. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3365.66s)]
*  Yeah, well let's see the difference though. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3366.66s)]
*  Pull up grizzly bear. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3368.66s)]
*  So a grizzly bear is a completely different motherfucker. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3370.16s)]
*  Yeah, so on the state flag of California. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3373.3799999999997s)]
*  That's a grizzly bear. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3375.94s)]
*  That's a grizzly bear. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3376.94s)]
*  Yes, that is a brown bear that is no longer, look at the size of those motherfuckers. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3377.94s)]
*  See that's a different thing. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3381.42s)]
*  See the difference in the size? [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3382.7000000000003s)]
*  So that's a black bear and that's a grizzly bear. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3385.1800000000003s)]
*  Grizzlies are much bigger, much more aggressive, much more dangerous. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3387.62s)]
*  But interestingly enough, black bears turn out to be more predatory towards humans. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3392.02s)]
*  So when a black bear attacks people, usually it's trying to eat them. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3398.0s)]
*  Whereas when a grizzly attacks people, generally, like a large percentage of the attacks are, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3401.46s)]
*  I'm good, a large percentage of the attacks are people accidentally stumbling upon a mother [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3406.98s)]
*  and their cubs. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3411.72s)]
*  That's the worst case scenario. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3412.72s)]
*  Because it's protective. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3415.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you get near a mama bear, that's so terrifying. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3416.3599999999997s)]
*  Because they just try to eliminate the threat immediately and they just go after you and [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3421.7999999999997s)]
*  fuck you up. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3426.2799999999997s)]
*  They don't look at you and go, what are you doing? [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3427.2799999999997s)]
*  What's this about? [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3429.7999999999997s)]
*  They have to protect their cubs. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3430.7999999999997s)]
*  And there's so much cannibalism in the bear world. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3432.3599999999997s)]
*  They eat their babes? [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3435.56s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3436.9199999999996s)]
*  Male grizzlies eat cubs and they hunt cubs. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3439.08s)]
*  And so there's so much cannibalism of cubs from male grizzlies that the females are always [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3443.6s)]
*  on edge. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3448.42s)]
*  Because everywhere they go, their fear is that they run into a male who's going to eat [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3449.92s)]
*  their cubs. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3453.42s)]
*  Grizzlies are fucking ruthless. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3455.24s)]
*  These assholes that think they want to bring grizzlies back to California, this is like [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3457.2799999999997s)]
*  a movement now to bring grizzlies back. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3461.38s)]
*  Because just like they brought wolves back to Colorado, these people are retarded and [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3463.48s)]
*  they've never spent a second in the woods. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3468.2799999999997s)]
*  They don't know what the fuck they're dealing with. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3470.8799999999997s)]
*  They don't know what you're bringing back and what the consequences are going to be [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3473.08s)]
*  of those things. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3477.04s)]
*  And look, there's places they exist and they're great. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3478.04s)]
*  It's awesome. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3480.3199999999997s)]
*  Go to Montana, you can see them. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3481.3199999999997s)]
*  Go to Wyoming, you can see them. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3482.52s)]
*  They're starting to make their way into Colorado. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3485.2s)]
*  A friend of mine saw one in the San Juan Mountains. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3486.7599999999998s)]
*  You got video footage of it. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3488.7999999999997s)]
*  I know you go with your archery hunting. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3490.3599999999997s)]
*  There's no hunting of bears? [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3494.56s)]
*  Yo, there's a lot of hunting of bears, not in the lower 48. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3495.88s)]
*  So they're trying to change that. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3498.6800000000003s)]
*  They're trying to change that in Montana because they have so many instances and attacks. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3500.1600000000003s)]
*  A woman was killed a couple years ago. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3505.84s)]
*  She was dragged out of her tent. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3507.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's scary shit, man. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3509.76s)]
*  And I'm not advocating for the eradication of grizzlies. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3512.8s)]
*  I'm just saying that with our modern society, when they haven't existed in an ecosystem, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3515.5200000000004s)]
*  to reintroduce that to the ecosystem, you're going to cause chaos. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3520.44s)]
*  You're going to cause havoc. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3523.84s)]
*  And if you want healthy breeding populations of them, good luck. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3525.36s)]
*  Good luck because now everything changes. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3530.0800000000004s)]
*  All your livestock changes, your dogs change, your dogs are going to get eaten. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3532.0800000000004s)]
*  Anything you have a dog chained up in the backyard, that's meat on a stick. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3537.0s)]
*  Meat on a chain. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3540.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's over. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3542.1600000000003s)]
*  They're going to do that. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3543.1600000000003s)]
*  They're going to target your garbage. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3545.88s)]
*  You're not going to be able to get rid of them. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3547.4s)]
*  They're going to keep coming back. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3549.0s)]
*  They're dangerous animals and they're beautiful and amazing and an important part of the ecosystems [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3551.2799999999997s)]
*  that they exist in currently, like Montana and Wyoming, where there's elk populations [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3556.52s)]
*  and a lot of food for them. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3561.12s)]
*  Yeah, I personally can't see for myself going out hunting for bears or elks or moose. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3562.64s)]
*  And I know you do that, but they're such incredible animals. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3570.72s)]
*  They're just incredible animals. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3576.3199999999997s)]
*  They are. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3577.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3578.64s)]
*  The way they die without me is way worse. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3580.6s)]
*  If I get them, I'm going to get them with an arrow and they're going to be dead in seconds. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3583.68s)]
*  If they get attacked by a bear or a mountain lion, it's fucking brutal. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3587.4s)]
*  It's brutal. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3591.3599999999997s)]
*  And the worst, I mean, they might just freeze to death. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3592.3599999999997s)]
*  That's how most of them go. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3594.6s)]
*  I know. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3595.6s)]
*  I shot an elk a couple years ago that was 11 years old and he had almost no teeth left. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3596.6s)]
*  His teeth were ground down because they don't live long and part of it is because they can't [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3600.68s)]
*  grind food after a certain age. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3607.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, because no teeth. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3609.48s)]
*  No teeth. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3610.8399999999997s)]
*  Because their teeth are, I mean, they're just digging into the ground and pulling out shrubs [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3611.8399999999997s)]
*  and grasses and they're constantly mashing and smashing. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3616.9599999999996s)]
*  And over the period of, you know, 11 years, his teeth had worn down to the roots. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3621.04s)]
*  So you've gone after bears? [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3627.3199999999997s)]
*  I've hunted bears before. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3629.48s)]
*  You've hunted bears? [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3630.48s)]
*  I've eaten bears before. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3631.48s)]
*  And you've eaten it? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3632.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3633.48s)]
*  What's the meat like? [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3634.48s)]
*  It's like beef. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3635.48s)]
*  Like a pig fucked a cow. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3636.64s)]
*  That's what it's like. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3639.4s)]
*  It's like a weird kind of beef. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3640.4s)]
*  Maybe a deer fucked a cow. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3642.28s)]
*  It's good though. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3644.72s)]
*  But it's dependent upon the diet of the animal. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3646.0s)]
*  So like the people that hunt grizzly bears and they've eaten grizzly bears or brown bears, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3648.88s)]
*  they say they taste so fishy, it's almost intolerable. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3653.96s)]
*  But you could turn them into sausage. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3657.08s)]
*  You could do it with the right spices and stuff. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3658.92s)]
*  Like bear sausage is great. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3660.84s)]
*  But you also have to be careful because of trichinosis. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3662.88s)]
*  You have to make sure you cook it to 160 plus degrees to kill off the trichinosis. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3666.48s)]
*  Because I know several people that got trichinosis from bear meat. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3671.6400000000003s)]
*  Heart? [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3675.04s)]
*  Well, it's just parasites in your muscles. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3676.04s)]
*  And it doesn't have too many adverse effects. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3678.56s)]
*  It means very painful and brutal for the beginning exposure, you know, the beginning infection. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3681.04s)]
*  But then the thing is like if you're a cannibal and you eat that dude and you don't cook [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3686.6s)]
*  them right, you're going to get it from him, which is really crazy. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3690.6s)]
*  One of the reasons why I don't eat pig that you got after me in the last time we were [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3693.12s)]
*  here. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3697.2s)]
*  Pig has a lot of parasites and a lot of them aren't cooked to the level to kill the parasites, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3699.84s)]
*  cysticercosis and so forth. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3705.7999999999997s)]
*  And trichinosis. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3707.7599999999998s)]
*  And trichinosis. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3708.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, especially wild pigs. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3709.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3710.7599999999998s)]
*  You know what the number one source of trichinosis is for people in America? [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3711.7599999999998s)]
*  No. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3715.2s)]
*  Black bears. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3716.2s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3717.2s)]
*  Think about how few people eat black bears. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3718.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3719.48s)]
*  It's the number one source of trichinosis in America for people that test positive for [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3721.4s)]
*  it. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3725.48s)]
*  So it's through contamination? [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3726.48s)]
*  From food. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3727.48s)]
*  From eating them. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3728.48s)]
*  From eating them. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3729.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3730.48s)]
*  Because there's a lot of people that hunt black bears. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3731.48s)]
*  Wow. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3732.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3733.48s)]
*  Want to really get blown away? [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3734.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3735.48s)]
*  You know what has the state has the largest population per capita of black bears in the [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3736.48s)]
*  country? [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3739.96s)]
*  Uh, Wyoming, Manhattan. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3740.96s)]
*  New Jersey. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3741.96s)]
*  No way. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3742.96s)]
*  Yep. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3743.96s)]
*  New Jersey. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3744.96s)]
*  New Jersey. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3745.96s)]
*  New Jersey has an infestation of black bears. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3746.96s)]
*  New Jersey, we played this video a hundred times with these giant bears that are duking [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3750.28s)]
*  it out in a beautiful suburb of far Rockaway, New Jersey. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3754.1600000000003s)]
*  So it's like nice, nice normal, not like the woods. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3758.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3761.48s)]
*  Not like, you know, fucking. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3762.48s)]
*  Residential area. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3763.48s)]
*  Yeah, not the mountains. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3764.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3765.48s)]
*  Residential area. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3766.48s)]
*  They knock over this mailbox and they're duking it out in the street. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3767.48s)]
*  Big fucking bears. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3769.96s)]
*  Big bears. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3771.2000000000003s)]
*  A guy recently shot the state record black bear in New Jersey and it was 800 pounds. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3772.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3778.28s)]
*  You should see it. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3779.6800000000003s)]
*  Pull that video up. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3780.6800000000003s)]
*  The photo rather up of this guy's bear. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3781.7200000000003s)]
*  So I'm pretty sure that was archery as well. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3783.84s)]
*  They banned bear hunting in New Jersey when the new governor came into place. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3786.92s)]
*  That lasted for about a year. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3791.2000000000003s)]
*  And then the human interactions with bears were so frequent and so that they restarted [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3793.1000000000004s)]
*  their bear hunting program. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3798.0400000000004s)]
*  It's an important tool. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3799.7000000000003s)]
*  Look at the size of the bear. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3800.7000000000003s)]
*  Look at the fucking size. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3801.7000000000003s)]
*  770. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3802.7000000000003s)]
*  770 dressed. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3803.7000000000003s)]
*  Wow. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3804.7000000000003s)]
*  770 after they gutted it. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3806.12s)]
*  And they added another 800 pounds for its intestines and organs. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3807.98s)]
*  Another 100 pounds. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3814.46s)]
*  So it's field dressed, the bear, before it was officially weighed in at 770. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3815.46s)]
*  So it's probably quite a bit heavier than that. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3822.46s)]
*  Pretty nuts. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3827.98s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3828.98s)]
*  So if you see there's other pictures of it where you really get a better size of it, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3829.98s)]
*  see if you can find some other pictures of it. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3833.12s)]
*  That is huge. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3834.54s)]
*  Yeah, some other pictures have it laid out and you can see what it looks like. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3836.38s)]
*  It's a fucking giant bear. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3840.1s)]
*  But it's because they have so much food there. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3842.22s)]
*  And a lot of these bears exist, look at the size of that thing. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3844.14s)]
*  A lot of these bears exist around humans. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3847.62s)]
*  And you've gone after a black bear? [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3850.74s)]
*  Not that big. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3852.46s)]
*  The black bears that I've shot are like 200 pounds, 250 pounds. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3854.06s)]
*  Babies. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3856.58s)]
*  Well, they didn't look like babies. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3857.58s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3859.14s)]
*  But yeah, you eat them, man. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3861.18s)]
*  Also it's an important part of conservation because if you don't control their populations, [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3863.0600000000004s)]
*  no one does. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3868.0600000000004s)]
*  This is the thing about bears, they are the top of the food chain. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3869.32s)]
*  So if you're not controlling them, no one does. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3872.36s)]
*  And so what they do is they eat each other. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3875.28s)]
*  That's the only control of bears is the infanticide of the cubs by the males. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3877.48s)]
*  And the females too, by the way. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3884.94s)]
*  You want to hear a crazy thing? [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3885.94s)]
*  My friend Jonathan, he watched this bear and this female bear. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3887.1800000000003s)]
*  So the male bear came around, the female bear is trying to fight him off, and she eventually [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3892.66s)]
*  can't. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3896.02s)]
*  And the male bear gets a hold of one of her cubs and kills it. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3897.02s)]
*  And she chases him off of her dead cub, then she eats her cub. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3899.18s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3903.58s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3904.58s)]
*  That's the real world. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3905.58s)]
*  That's the real world. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3907.46s)]
*  She ate her cub right in front of him. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3908.46s)]
*  And he came back to camp and he was like, fuck. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3909.86s)]
*  So that's the balance that has to be struck. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3914.42s)]
*  Where was it? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3917.58s)]
*  Was it where they had open season for elk or for moose? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3919.18s)]
*  No. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3924.18s)]
*  Was it moose? [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3925.18s)]
*  No, there's no open season. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3926.18s)]
*  Which state was it? [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3928.2999999999997s)]
*  Open season means? [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3929.2999999999997s)]
*  Where you didn't need a permit. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3930.2999999999997s)]
*  They had a cold. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3932.58s)]
*  There's no way. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3934.18s)]
*  They would never do that with elk. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3935.18s)]
*  Elk is a very valuable. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3936.22s)]
*  So it's moose. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3937.22s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3938.22s)]
*  They would never do that with moose either. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3939.22s)]
*  They do it in some communities with white-tailed deer. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3941.9s)]
*  And the reason why they do it is because they're completely overpopulated. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3945.18s)]
*  And oddly enough, this happens a lot in the suburbs. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3948.02s)]
*  Like, there's places in the suburbs, yeah, where there's people who bow hunt in the suburbs. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3950.2200000000003s)]
*  Because look, if you're bow hunting, your arrow doesn't go more than 100 yards. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3956.34s)]
*  It's not like you have to worry about you shoot and someone a mile away gets hit by [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3960.82s)]
*  a bullet if you miss. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3963.7000000000003s)]
*  Your arrow drops. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3966.54s)]
*  It arcs, right? [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3967.54s)]
*  Archery. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3968.54s)]
*  It arcs. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3969.54s)]
*  So it drops down to the ground. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3970.54s)]
*  It only goes so far. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3971.54s)]
*  And so it's safer if you have competent hunters who are skilled to hunt in the suburbs. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3973.06s)]
*  Most of these suburbs have wooded areas. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3978.46s)]
*  And they're infested with deer. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3980.38s)]
*  So I think it was Pennsylvania. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3983.1400000000003s)]
*  The states that were bringing in bow hunters. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3985.5800000000004s)]
*  In New York, and in all their wisdom, these fucking dorks, in the area around the Hamptons, [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3989.1000000000004s)]
*  they have this issue. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3994.98s)]
*  But the people are so fucking retarded. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3995.98s)]
*  Long Island. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3997.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3998.7400000000002s)]
*  Well, it's the Hamptons, because they're rich. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=3999.7400000000002s)]
*  It's like if you have regular Long Island, regular Long Island would probably say, yeah, [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4001.5400000000004s)]
*  we should hunt them, because they're food. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4004.42s)]
*  I'm from Queens. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4005.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4006.7000000000003s)]
*  So they decided they were going to just try to sterilize the deer and give them birth [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4008.3799999999997s)]
*  control. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4012.66s)]
*  They came up with all these wacky concepts, but they didn't want to bring in bow hunters. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4013.66s)]
*  But wasn't there in the last, what, five years, there was an overpopulation of moose or deer, [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4017.1s)]
*  elk on this side? [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4021.8599999999997s)]
*  Never. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4022.8599999999997s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4023.8599999999997s)]
*  No? [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4024.8599999999997s)]
*  There's been times where they had seasons in winter for elk in Montana. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4025.8599999999997s)]
*  And the reason, it was a complete depopulation effort. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4030.9399999999996s)]
*  So they had had, this is before the reintroduction of wolves, though. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4033.7799999999997s)]
*  So the reintroduction of wolves, which is in the 1990s, has significantly impacted the [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4037.8999999999996s)]
*  elk population. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4041.9399999999996s)]
*  And now it's actually more difficult to get a tag. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4043.7799999999997s)]
*  But back then, they would have certain seasons that would have in the winter. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4046.9799999999996s)]
*  So you'd be able to get these elk that were out there in the snow moving very slowly in [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4050.8199999999997s)]
*  the deep snow, and you could just kind of pick them off. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4056.66s)]
*  And it was basically just a meat hunt. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4059.3799999999997s)]
*  They killed a lot of cows that way, cow elk. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4061.78s)]
*  And it was just a way for people to get meat. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4064.7400000000002s)]
*  And also, they were trying to put a dent on the population because it wasn't sustainable. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4068.2200000000003s)]
*  So they would have an elk herd of thousands of elk, where it really should have been like [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4072.32s)]
*  800 elk with the sustainability of the area. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4077.1000000000004s)]
*  And the bear couldn't keep up. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4081.6200000000003s)]
*  They couldn't eat enough of them. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4083.26s)]
*  The mountain lions couldn't eat enough of them. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4084.4s)]
*  And then they brought in the wolves. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4086.0400000000004s)]
*  And the wolves were way better than everybody else because they hunt together. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4087.4s)]
*  And they started really chipping away at them. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4090.3s)]
*  And now they've knocked the elk population down. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4092.6400000000003s)]
*  I think it's in the neighborhood. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4095.0800000000004s)]
*  Or they dropped it by 40% plus. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4096.52s)]
*  What was the need for reducing the elk population? [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4098.76s)]
*  Well, if you don't have a balanced ecosystem, right? [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4103.360000000001s)]
*  If you don't have enough predators and you have a large animal like an elk, like a bull [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4106.92s)]
*  elk is an 800 pound animal. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4112.4400000000005s)]
*  And a cow elk, a mature cow elk is north of 300 pounds, 400 pounds. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4114.400000000001s)]
*  This is a lot of food. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4119.2s)]
*  And they can decimate vegetation. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4120.76s)]
*  And there is a documentary that's kind of like pooh-poohed by people, but interesting [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4123.84s)]
*  nonetheless. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4129.5599999999995s)]
*  It's how wolves changed rivers. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4130.5599999999995s)]
*  And it's all about how the Yellowstone ecosystem changed because of their introduction to wolves. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4134.24s)]
*  And more songbirds came in because there was more vegetation. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4139.16s)]
*  Because the introduction of wolves, they killed off a lot of the elk. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4142.0s)]
*  The elk had been just like maybe overbalanced in the fact that they were overrepresented. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4144.74s)]
*  They were eating too much vegetation. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4150.66s)]
*  It's all interesting. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4152.98s)]
*  But what you really want is things to happen naturally. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4153.98s)]
*  And then when there's a problem, really the best way to handle the problem if there's [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4157.0199999999995s)]
*  like an overabundance of these animals is to bring in hunters. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4163.42s)]
*  The other solution would be to bring in predators. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4168.58s)]
*  The problem with bringing in predators is if you have a predator like wolves that has [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4171.14s)]
*  been forever maligned because they go after livestock and they do target ranchers. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4176.46s)]
*  There was an article I read today actually about these ranchers that were kind of optimistic [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4183.46s)]
*  about wolves being introduced into Colorado and now they vehemently oppose it because [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4187.780000000001s)]
*  they've seen the impact. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4192.22s)]
*  And one of the reasons why they saw the impact is because the governor of Colorado, in all [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4193.820000000001s)]
*  his fucking infinite wisdom, he had a mandate to get these wolves introduced during a certain [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4197.62s)]
*  amount of time and they didn't have the wolves. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4203.42s)]
*  So they got wolves from Oregon that they had captured while they were preying on livestock. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4205.5s)]
*  So these wolves were already accustomed to preying on livestock and those are the wolves [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4212.14s)]
*  they reintroduced into Colorado. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4216.22s)]
*  They reintroduced wolves that had already been naturalized to killing livestock. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4218.26s)]
*  And so what'd they start doing? [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4224.38s)]
*  They started finding livestock and killing them again. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4225.82s)]
*  Duh! [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4228.0199999999995s)]
*  But that's the thing. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4229.0199999999995s)]
*  It's like you're fucking around with nature and you don't know how this calculation is [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4231.38s)]
*  going to end. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4235.74s)]
*  A good example is Australia. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4237.94s)]
*  Australia is a fucking mess because they kept bringing in animals and then they'd bring [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4240.5s)]
*  in animals to kill the animals and then they'd have an overpopulation of certain animals [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4245.34s)]
*  so they'd bring in cats and now they have an overpopulation of feral cats to the point [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4249.219999999999s)]
*  where they hunt feral cats. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4253.099999999999s)]
*  If you look at an Australian bow hunting journal, you know they have bow hunting magazines. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4255.22s)]
*  My buddy Adam Green Tree, shout out to Adam Green Tree. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4259.14s)]
*  My buddy Adam gave me a magazine from Australia bow hunting and I'm like, bro what the fuck [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4261.9400000000005s)]
*  is this? [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4266.02s)]
*  It's all cats. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4267.02s)]
*  These guys are holding up house cats because they kill feral cats whenever they can because [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4268.02s)]
*  feral cats have decimated ground nesting birds and they've destroyed a shit ton of native [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4273.5s)]
*  animals that were in that area. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4281.06s)]
*  They brought them in to kill some other animal they brought in. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4283.5s)]
*  It's like you can't fuck around with nature like that. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4286.06s)]
*  You don't know what the consequences are and when you do ballot box biology, which is essentially [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4290.46s)]
*  what this stuff is. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4295.1s)]
*  The reintroduction of wolves is something people voted on. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4296.46s)]
*  The people that voted on it are living in fucking Denver. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4299.7s)]
*  They don't encounter wolves. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4302.06s)]
*  They don't know what they're doing. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4303.58s)]
*  It's like the same thing happened in Vancouver. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4304.58s)]
*  In British Columbia, they outlawed grizzly bear hunting. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4307.22s)]
*  Why did they do that? [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4309.62s)]
*  Because, man, why would you kill it? [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4310.62s)]
*  They call it trophy hunting, but it's important to manage the predators. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4312.1s)]
*  The people that knew this were the people that lived in the rural areas that were vehemently [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4317.14s)]
*  opposed to this ban. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4320.900000000001s)]
*  And then what happens? [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4322.620000000001s)]
*  Well, you got ballot box biology. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4323.620000000001s)]
*  You get people that have no experience with bears, don't encounter bears, don't have to [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4325.54s)]
*  worry about bears. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4329.26s)]
*  They say, yeah, let's not ban them anymore. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4330.660000000001s)]
*  Now you got bears breaking into people's houses and there's much more of them than ever before. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4332.34s)]
*  People are freaked out. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4336.620000000001s)]
*  You can't do anything about it. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4337.620000000001s)]
*  I freaked out when the bear came to the house. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4339.94s)]
*  Yeah, you should. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4342.259999999999s)]
*  It was like, whoa. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4343.259999999999s)]
*  You should. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4344.259999999999s)]
*  And then seeing this fucking bear, 250 pounds, swimming in my swimming pool, going back and [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4345.259999999999s)]
*  forth. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4351.299999999999s)]
*  And then the Department of Parks and Rangers came in to try and deal with it. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4352.299999999999s)]
*  They said, stop feeding it. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4359.54s)]
*  I'm not feeding it. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4360.94s)]
*  I put the fucking beef into the garbage can because it's no longer, it wasn't frozen. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4361.94s)]
*  The bear kept on going, don't put it there. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4368.22s)]
*  Where should I put it? [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4370.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4371.22s)]
*  Where do you put the meat? [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4372.22s)]
*  You should put it at your asshole neighbor's house. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4373.22s)]
*  You have some guy that's annoying. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4375.22s)]
*  Go use his garbage in the middle of the night. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4377.86s)]
*  I've got a bad neighbor. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4379.34s)]
*  I'm going to have to put it into there. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4380.34s)]
*  Yeah, you should dress up though. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4381.34s)]
*  Dress up like a Ku Klux Klan member or something like that so they don't know what you look [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4382.7s)]
*  like. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4385.46s)]
*  No, dress up as a bear to go into Rolls Royce to destroy the Rolls Royce. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4386.46s)]
*  Oh, there you go. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4388.7s)]
*  You remember that one? [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4389.7s)]
*  No, what was that? [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4390.7s)]
*  You didn't see that? [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4391.7s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4392.7s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4393.74s)]
*  A guy was wearing a bear suit and did insurance fraud. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4394.74s)]
*  Insurance fraud. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4398.9s)]
*  They brought in a bear expert and said, that bear would not have gone into the Rolls Royce [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4399.9s)]
*  and done those scrape marks on it. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4404.66s)]
*  So this guy was trying to get rid of his car? [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4407.74s)]
*  He was trying to get insurance money. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4409.38s)]
*  Oh, what a moron. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4411.54s)]
*  What a silly bitch. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4413.54s)]
*  I've learned right now so much more about bears. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4415.74s)]
*  Incredible. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4419.3s)]
*  Yeah, they're a wild animal. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4420.3s)]
*  Not wild, just wild, but fascinating. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4423.099999999999s)]
*  I love them. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4424.099999999999s)]
*  Teddy Roosevelt, when he did his bear hunting, loved it. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4425.099999999999s)]
*  Bears are such incredible animals. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4430.58s)]
*  You know what the scariest bear to run across is? [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4431.58s)]
*  Take a guess. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4433.62s)]
*  Polar bear. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4435.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, white bear. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4436.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4437.0199999999995s)]
*  You know why? [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4438.0199999999995s)]
*  No. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4439.0199999999995s)]
*  Because they don't eat anything but meat. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4440.0199999999995s)]
*  At least grizzly bears. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4441.0199999999995s)]
*  If you find a grizzly bear that's in a blueberry field, you probably don't even have to worry [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4442.0199999999995s)]
*  about them. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4445.62s)]
*  They eat blueberries? [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4446.62s)]
*  Oh yeah, they'd be gorging on blueberries. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4447.62s)]
*  But black bears and grizzly bears are omnivorous. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4449.339999999999s)]
*  So they eat vegetation and they also eat meat. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4452.32s)]
*  Polar bears are just carnivores. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4455.719999999999s)]
*  And they're hyper aggressive. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4457.88s)]
*  They just eat seals and occasionally people. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4459.12s)]
*  But they hunt people. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4462.12s)]
*  No way. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4463.599999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, they'll go after you. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4464.599999999999s)]
*  They smell you from a distance to hunt you. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4465.96s)]
*  Bad body odor or something? [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4468.28s)]
*  Just you smell. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4471.2s)]
*  Everybody smells. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4472.759999999999s)]
*  You'd be amazed at how much a bear can smell. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4473.759999999999s)]
*  There was a video where my friend was in, I think they were in Montana, maybe Idaho. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4476.96s)]
*  And a bear was 700 yards away plus and the wind hit the back of his neck and the bear [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4484.28s)]
*  started running. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4493.64s)]
*  And he's like, did that fucking bear wind us? [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4494.64s)]
*  The bear caught their smell from 700 yards away. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4497.96s)]
*  And went after them. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4501.96s)]
*  No, the other way. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4503.56s)]
*  It ran away. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4504.56s)]
*  Black bears run away. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4505.56s)]
*  Human run. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4507.160000000001s)]
*  In any area where the bears get hunted, they run away. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4509.360000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4512.280000000001s)]
*  Like in Alaska, if they smell you, generally they run away because people hunt bears in [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4513.280000000001s)]
*  Alaska. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=4516.360000000001s)]

*  about ridiculous shit, and you are a doctor, [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5102.34s)]
*  I wanted to bring this up to you [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5105.02s)]
*  because Jamie and I were exchanging text messages [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5106.1s)]
*  yesterday about these mummies that they found in Peru [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5109.1s)]
*  that have three fingers. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5113.820000000001s)]
*  The aliens. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5116.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, I don't know what they are, [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5117.46s)]
*  but they have three fingers, and not three fingers [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5118.780000000001s)]
*  because they cut the fingers off. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5121.620000000001s)]
*  Actually, their structure genetically is three fingers. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5123.46s)]
*  And their cranial capacity, they have a large head, [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5126.46s)]
*  which a lot of times they think was due to, [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5131.5s)]
*  you know, they would form their head [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5133.900000000001s)]
*  and press boards to make their head stretch out, [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5135.34s)]
*  which they definitely did in some tribes. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5137.7s)]
*  Like Chinese do with their feet. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5139.099999999999s)]
*  But the question is why were they doing that, [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5139.94s)]
*  and were they doing it to replicate something else? [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5141.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5144.0599999999995s)]
*  So the thing about these is they had a cranial capacity [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5144.9s)]
*  that is larger than most human beings. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5147.62s)]
*  That's alien. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5150.78s)]
*  It looks like a fucking alien. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5151.78s)]
*  That's correct. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5152.82s)]
*  But is that real? [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5154.46s)]
*  Here's the question. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5155.62s)]
*  Okay, three-fingered alien mummies. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5158.0599999999995s)]
*  Click on that article and see where they get in the center. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5160.099999999999s)]
*  I know it was in, yeah, New York Post. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5162.82s)]
*  So three-fingered alien mummies found in Peru [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5164.9s)]
*  have fingerprints that do not appear to be human. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5168.66s)]
*  So the fingerprints that it has, [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5171.7s)]
*  instead of spirals, I think they're lines. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5173.74s)]
*  But scroll back, scroll back to where you were. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5179.82s)]
*  Look at that image. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5181.98s)]
*  That's X-ray image of their fingers. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5183.219999999999s)]
*  So these are like real bones and digits. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5186.139999999999s)]
*  So this isn't just a statue that someone made. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5188.98s)]
*  This says real bone structure that is exact [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5192.98s)]
*  to what a human being has, [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5195.98s)]
*  all those little tiny muscles in the midhand. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5197.259999999999s)]
*  Right? [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5199.58s)]
*  I mean, that at all looks normal, but weird, [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5200.459999999999s)]
*  with the three fingers and three toes. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5202.66s)]
*  And so if you scroll down, you'll see more images. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5205.0199999999995s)]
*  So this is what it looked like when they found it. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5209.62s)]
*  So the body is covered, go back so I can read that, please. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5213.259999999999s)]
*  It says the body is covered with diatomaceous, [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5218.379999999999s)]
*  how do you say that? [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5221.98s)]
*  Diatomaceous earth, a type of white powder [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5223.66s)]
*  made from the sediment of fossilized algae [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5225.5s)]
*  found in the bodies of water. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5227.46s)]
*  The only possible explanation [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5229.099999999999s)]
*  for the unusually straight fingerprints [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5230.46s)]
*  could possibly have something to do [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5232.98s)]
*  with the way her skin was preserved, he said, [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5234.38s)]
*  noting that it's very odd. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5236.5s)]
*  So the US medical examiners traveled to Peru last April [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5238.299999999999s)]
*  to study the bodies with a lack of human fingerprints [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5241.74s)]
*  as puzzling. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5244.0599999999995s)]
*  He said it would be extremely premature [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5245.0199999999995s)]
*  to make any statements about the mummy's origins. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5247.0599999999995s)]
*  So they know for a fact that these things are biological [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5249.9s)]
*  and they're not created, have they done any sort of DNA? [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5253.14s)]
*  Look at the picture of what it actually looks like. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5255.18s)]
*  That's fucking crazy. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5257.9s)]
*  That does look like an alien. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5260.34s)]
*  I mean, that's exactly what people expect to see [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5262.3s)]
*  at their bed in the middle of the night. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5264.46s)]
*  You said it looks like an alien. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5266.14s)]
*  It is an alien. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5268.18s)]
*  If it's real. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5269.5s)]
*  It's so hard, and no disrespect to the post. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5270.82s)]
*  But people bullshit. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5273.82s)]
*  Not those, those I think have proven to be horseshit. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5275.78s)]
*  But if you scroll up, scroll back to where you were, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5278.74s)]
*  that thing, okay. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5282.22s)]
*  I wanna know what that is. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5284.46s)]
*  Like what is that? [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5285.900000000001s)]
*  Because it's got three fingers and three toes [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5287.18s)]
*  and it's got an alien face. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5289.14s)]
*  It looks like a gray. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5290.860000000001s)]
*  It has a tiny slot for a mouth and tiny dots for a nose. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5292.9400000000005s)]
*  It looks like the archetypal alien [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5295.860000000001s)]
*  that people see in like Close Encounters of the Third Kind. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5300.9800000000005s)]
*  And what was that other movie? [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5305.18s)]
*  The Whitley Stryber movie, Communion. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5306.58s)]
*  Communion. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5309.22s)]
*  I didn't see that one. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5310.06s)]
*  That's a weird one [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5311.299999999999s)]
*  because Whitley Stryber is also a fiction writer. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5312.139999999999s)]
*  And he wrote this book [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5315.78s)]
*  about his own personal experiences with aliens, [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5316.62s)]
*  which I wanna believe him. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5318.66s)]
*  That's a classical impression face-wise [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5320.0199999999995s)]
*  of an alien of gray as you say. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5323.0599999999995s)]
*  100%. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5324.66s)]
*  Even with the shape of the eyes, [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5325.58s)]
*  the eyes are kind of slanted, not like a human's. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5327.379999999999s)]
*  They're at angles. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5330.7s)]
*  Just like they always show them with these kind of, [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5331.54s)]
*  they look, you know. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5334.179999999999s)]
*  Oh, the big eyes, the ominized, the large. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5335.0199999999995s)]
*  We have to have an image of one of them [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5338.099999999999s)]
*  around here somewhere, don't we? [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5338.94s)]
*  Aliens all over this fucking place. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5340.9400000000005s)]
*  But that classic look is exactly [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5342.54s)]
*  what those mummies look like. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5344.9400000000005s)]
*  So they have straight, go back. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5346.900000000001s)]
*  What did you just wear? [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5348.9800000000005s)]
*  Three-fingered. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5350.46s)]
*  Jesus Christ, all these pop-ups. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5351.5s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5352.860000000001s)]
*  It says the humanoid three-fingered alien mummies [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5353.780000000001s)]
*  have straight fingerprints that do not match those of humans [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5355.900000000001s)]
*  according to an attorney who reviewed [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5358.9800000000005s)]
*  one of the controversial specimens. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5360.860000000001s)]
*  Oh, an attorney said that. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5362.580000000001s)]
*  You believe him? [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5364.02s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5364.860000000001s)]
*  That's where the rest of this came from [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5365.700000000001s)]
*  is because this guy didn't believe [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5366.54s)]
*  whatever I was saying. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5368.18s)]
*  So he's like, we're gonna go look. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5369.02s)]
*  So Joshua McDowell, a former Colorado prosecutor [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5370.5s)]
*  and current defense attorney, [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5373.860000000001s)]
*  examined one of the tiny strange bodies named Maria [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5375.26s)]
*  with three independent forensic medical examiners [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5378.5s)]
*  from the United States. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5380.700000000001s)]
*  Scroll. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5381.700000000001s)]
*  It said he and the experts were shocked to discover [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5383.26s)]
*  that the fingerprints in the ET-like corpses [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5385.22s)]
*  were in perfectly straight lines. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5387.26s)]
*  They were not traditional human fingerprint patterns, [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5388.9400000000005s)]
*  he told the Daily Mail. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5391.740000000001s)]
*  But did they do an analysis of the tissue? [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5393.580000000001s)]
*  Like did they find out that it's actually [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5396.34s)]
*  biological tissue? [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5399.86s)]
*  Can you scroll down further? [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5401.259999999999s)]
*  It doesn't say anything like that. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5402.419999999999s)]
*  It doesn't say that? [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5403.259999999999s)]
*  So I was trying to go to different articles [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5404.099999999999s)]
*  to find better. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5404.94s)]
*  So I'm a forensic prosecutor, [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5405.78s)]
*  I'm a criminal defense attorney, [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5406.74s)]
*  I've seen lots of fingerprints [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5408.259999999999s)]
*  and these were not classic fingerprints. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5409.46s)]
*  Look how weird it is. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5411.339999999999s)]
*  Look at that image. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5412.299999999999s)]
*  That's so crazy looking. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5413.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5414.86s)]
*  And also, how did I just find out about this yesterday? [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5415.7s)]
*  You talked about it before. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5419.259999999999s)]
*  I know, but I never saw it look like this. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5420.179999999999s)]
*  What I saw with those other ones [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5422.54s)]
*  that I think have been proven, [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5424.339999999999s)]
*  I might be wrong, [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5426.299999999999s)]
*  but I think at least allegedly [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5427.34s)]
*  had been proven to not be real. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5429.22s)]
*  And that the person who was exposing those, [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5431.34s)]
*  those little tiny ones that were laying down straight, [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5434.82s)]
*  that guy had a history of doing some deceptive stuff, [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5437.7s)]
*  allegedly. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5442.42s)]
*  But you believe that they're there. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5443.860000000001s)]
*  Do I believe? [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5445.54s)]
*  I mean, you believe that the aliens are here. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5446.38s)]
*  I do not not believe. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5447.9400000000005s)]
*  Do not not believe. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5449.3s)]
*  So you're- I don't disbelieve. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5450.66s)]
*  You're ambivalent as to the fact that they're here. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5452.78s)]
*  I believe that they're here. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5454.58s)]
*  I wouldn't even say I'm ambivalent. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5455.66s)]
*  I am open-minded, but- [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5458.18s)]
*  You won't say yes. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5459.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm logical. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5461.14s)]
*  I think there's a lot of deception going on. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5462.46s)]
*  I think there's also the possibility [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5465.02s)]
*  that what we're dealing with is not as simple [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5466.9800000000005s)]
*  as we like to think. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5468.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, these things. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5469.780000000001s)]
*  So these things I've heard are bullshit. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5470.860000000001s)]
*  I don't, might be wrong. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5473.9800000000005s)]
*  But- [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5476.14s)]
*  I'm trying to find out. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5476.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, might that be misinformation? [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5477.820000000001s)]
*  That journalist that unveiled the bodies [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5479.7s)]
*  and the guy who exposed the bodies, [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5484.14s)]
*  the guy who exposed the bodies, I think, was the one, [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5486.34s)]
*  the guy who came up with it. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5488.7s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to figure out how, [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5491.9400000000005s)]
*  so there's an issue of them being found in Peru [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5493.900000000001s)]
*  and taken to Mexico. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5496.62s)]
*  Oh. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5497.9800000000005s)]
*  There's already that issue. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5498.82s)]
*  Okay. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5499.66s)]
*  And then where they said they were found near Nazca in 2017, [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5500.5s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out, okay, who found them? [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5504.54s)]
*  Nazca and lines. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5506.38s)]
*  Yeah, that was the thing about that alien looking one [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5507.22s)]
*  with the three fingers that was even more interesting to me [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5510.860000000001s)]
*  because that's that area where there's these incredible [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5513.86s)]
*  patterns that are made on the ground [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5516.5s)]
*  that you can only see from space. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5518.62s)]
*  Or not space, the air. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5520.5s)]
*  You can only see looking down on them. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5522.42s)]
*  So it's like, why would anybody even make those things? [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5524.78s)]
*  And some of them look like, [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5526.66s)]

*  I forget what they call them, like bird feet, [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5854.08s)]
*  or I forget how they describe them. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5856.12s)]
*  Yeah, these are the folks. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5857.88s)]
*  So see that? [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5859.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5860.0s)]
*  So now if you found these guys, [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5860.84s)]
*  and there's not just one of them, [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5863.2s)]
*  substantial minority of Vodoma have a condition known as [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5864.88s)]
*  extra, you said that, you're the doctor. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5868.68s)]
*  Ectodactyly. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5870.8s)]
*  Ectodactyly, which means the middle three toes are absent, [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5871.96s)]
*  and the two outer ones are turned in, [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5874.68s)]
*  resulting in the tribe being known as the two-toed, [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5876.88s)]
*  or ostrich-footed tribe. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5879.12s)]
*  So go to images and see what that looks like. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5881.04s)]
*  It's really wild, [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5883.639999999999s)]
*  because there's like a bunch of them hanging out together. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5885.24s)]
*  Like look at their feet. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5886.92s)]
*  So now if you found a body that had those, [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5888.04s)]
*  you would say, oh, those are aliens. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5891.36s)]
*  No, but look at that alien, [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5893.48s)]
*  if you go back to the one that was original, [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5895.32s)]
*  with the eyes and the face and the size. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5897.04s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5899.36s)]
*  These are grays, okay? [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5900.2s)]
*  Well, it certainly looks like [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5901.8s)]
*  what I would think a gray would be. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5903.16s)]
*  And the fact that it doesn't have a thumb is odd too. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5905.04s)]
*  But that is also one of the things [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5908.36s)]
*  that people have said about these things. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5909.4s)]
*  There's also, they always have said [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5911.16s)]
*  that they have very long fingers. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5914.16s)]
*  And you look at his fingers in relation to the size [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5915.56s)]
*  of the body, they're very long. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5918.68s)]
*  Long fingers and very long toes. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5919.72s)]
*  Yeah, I mean. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5922.56s)]
*  How do you account for the fact that there are multiple, [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5924.04s)]
*  from the Assyrians to the Egyptians [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5927.68s)]
*  to the Aztecs, Toltecs, Mayans, [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5930.84s)]
*  where they have on their structures, [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5936.08s)]
*  they have imagery of flying saucers, [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5938.92s)]
*  helicopters on alien. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5941.6s)]
*  There is a couple with the, they look alien. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5944.32s)]
*  How do you account for that? [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5946.8s)]
*  I think the helicopter one, I think, is a fraud. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5947.64s)]
*  You think it's all fraud? [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5949.64s)]
*  I think that one is. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5950.64s)]
*  But why is it duplicated? [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5951.4800000000005s)]
*  I think that's photoshopped. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5952.320000000001s)]
*  I think it is. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5953.16s)]
*  You think? [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5954.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's been shown. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5954.84s)]
*  But the planes that they found [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5957.72s)]
*  that are like wooden carved planes, [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5960.96s)]
*  like they look like airplanes that they found in tombs. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5964.72s)]
*  That's fascinating, they have a rudder. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5968.64s)]
*  They have a tail, they have wings. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5970.68s)]
*  And it looks like a plane. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5972.56s)]
*  Yeah, so how do you account for that? [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5974.04s)]
*  That is crazy. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5975.2s)]
*  How do you account for that? [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5976.12s)]
*  Well, I don't know what we're looking at. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5977.72s)]
*  And I think there's more to reality than we see. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5981.599999999999s)]
*  I have a feeling that our senses are extremely limited [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5986.8s)]
*  and that there's other dimensions [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5990.28s)]
*  that we don't have access to that might have access to us. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5993.08s)]
*  I don't necessarily discredit the idea [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5997.0s)]
*  of something traveling from another planet. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=5999.88s)]
*  Right, dimensional. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6002.12s)]
*  I think we might be dealing with that too. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6002.96s)]
*  I think we might be dealing with [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6004.88s)]
*  a bunch of different civilizations and entities [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6006.4800000000005s)]
*  that are at very different stages of evolution. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6009.4400000000005s)]
*  So if life exists all throughout the galaxy, [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6013.24s)]
*  we know a bunch of things, right? [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6016.68s)]
*  We know that planets have certain ages. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6018.68s)]
*  We know that some planets are very old [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6022.46s)]
*  and some planets are much younger. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6024.68s)]
*  And we know that some planets are much closer to the sun [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6026.28s)]
*  and some planets live in a very hospitable environment. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6029.32s)]
*  We know that some planets like ours [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6032.08s)]
*  are essentially in a shooting gallery [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6034.0s)]
*  because there's 900,000 near earth objects or more [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6035.8s)]
*  that are flying around, slamming into things. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6040.2s)]
*  And if it wasn't for Jupiter, we'd be fucked. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6042.64s)]
*  If it wasn't for Jupiter's enormous gravity and mass [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6044.64s)]
*  pulling everything into it, [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6048.08s)]
*  that's like basically our catcher. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6049.84s)]
*  It catches all the shit that flies into our solar system [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6051.88s)]
*  and slams into Jupiter. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6054.48s)]
*  And of course the moon itself is pockmarked with. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6055.84s)]
*  So imagine a planet that doesn't have that issue. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6058.76s)]
*  Imagine a planet that has a different environment [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6062.56s)]
*  where there's not a bunch of shit flying around. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6064.52s)]
*  And they think that flying around stuff [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6066.4800000000005s)]
*  is largely a part of collisions, [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6068.04s)]
*  like planets colliding with each other in the distant past. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6070.4400000000005s)]
*  And that's actually how earth got formed. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6073.200000000001s)]
*  You got a bathroom? [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6075.6s)]
*  Yeah, go, go, go, go, go. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6076.42s)]
*  This is a good time. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6078.26s)]
*  I'm investigating this stuff. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6079.1s)]
*  Jamie's investigating. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6080.200000000001s)]
*  Yes, I'm excited. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6081.64s)]
*  Investigate. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6083.4800000000005s)]
*  Why would there be? [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6084.320000000001s)]
*  Go pee, go pee. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6085.160000000001s)]
*  Come on, buddy. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6086.72s)]
*  To the left. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6089.080000000001s)]
*  To the left. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6089.92s)]
*  This dude's already lit. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6091.0s)]
*  He's had three giant glasses of whiskey. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6093.16s)]
*  And he's 78 years old? [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6096.32s)]
*  Yeah, I got a clearer picture of that egg too. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6097.5199999999995s)]
*  God, I hope my brain works that good when I'm 78. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6099.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6102.04s)]
*  Like that dude just, he doesn't even know any notes. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6102.86s)]
*  He's just pulling all this information out of the ether. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6105.719999999999s)]
*  So the guy who took him, you mean the weight? [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6107.88s)]
*  Which, the egg? [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6110.2s)]
*  No, no, fuck the egg. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6111.32s)]
*  This is the Nazca-mami stuff. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6113.24s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6114.96s)]
*  He said he removed as many as 200 sets [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6116.639999999999s)]
*  of remains from the cave. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6118.599999999999s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6120.36s)]
*  His bodies have been smuggled out of Peru to France, [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6121.2s)]
*  Spain and Russia. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6123.2s)]
*  In an interview with Reuters, he said, [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6125.8s)]
*  this is from. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6129.84s)]
*  What would you do? [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6130.88s)]
*  Let's ask this. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6132.32s)]
*  What would you do if somebody got you one of them mummies? [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6133.16s)]
*  If somebody said, hey Jamie, [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6136.679999999999s)]
*  give me that money that you won from Shane. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6138.36s)]
*  Ooh, look at that. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6140.28s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6141.48s)]
*  The same thing though, three toes. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6142.639999999999s)]
*  Look how long the fucking toes are. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6144.639999999999s)]
*  I think that's where the x-ray comes from is these. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6146.08s)]
*  Oh. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6148.92s)]
*  It's the same guy, the McDowell guy. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6150.24s)]

*  Yeah, it's the same people. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6154.44s)]
*  Little sus, right? [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6155.5199999999995s)]
*  They found about eight, I think, [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6156.88s)]
*  is what they're saying here. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6158.32s)]
*  And then the McDowell's father is saying [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6159.92s)]
*  they're having a hard time getting them to the US [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6161.76s)]
*  to do more studies. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6164.12s)]
*  Oh yeah, super hard. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6165.2s)]
*  Cut the fucking shit. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6166.639999999999s)]
*  They're already pissed about them disappearing. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6167.48s)]
*  He'll shoot a rocket over there, [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6169.44s)]
*  pick those things up quick. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6170.92s)]

*  Have they done an x-ray of the skull? [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6174.04s)]
*  Why would they do that? [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6176.08s)]
*  I had an x-ray on one of these. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6176.92s)]
*  Of the skull? [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6178.36s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6179.24s)]
*  Holy shit, dude, it looks like a skull. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6181.599999999999s)]
*  I think one of the smaller ones though. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6183.32s)]
*  Yeah, but whatever. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6184.72s)]
*  Look at that thing. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6185.96s)]
*  I think this could be eggs. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6186.8s)]
*  What? [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6188.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6189.48s)]
*  What is that? [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6190.5199999999995s)]
*  Like the ribs look a little weird. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6192.2s)]
*  Imagine if you found out those like anal toys [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6193.04s)]
*  and they're just freaks. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6195.639999999999s)]
*  I do believe one of these they were saying [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6196.76s)]
*  was made up of different animal parts and stuff. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6198.16s)]
*  Come sit down and put a microphone on. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6199.72s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6201.92s)]
*  So we're looking at x-rays of one of them is bullshit. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6202.76s)]
*  Look at the fucking x-rays of the skulls, man. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6206.0s)]
*  Like you're a doctor, look at that. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6210.08s)]
*  That looks like real shit, right? [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6211.76s)]
*  That looks like real, yeah. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6213.4s)]
*  Oh, it looks like real bones. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6214.84s)]
*  Well, yeah, the density. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6216.96s)]
*  Completely different, yeah. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6217.8s)]
*  X-ray shows it, the capillary and the space for the brain. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6218.84s)]
*  What is that thing across his chest? [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6223.44s)]
*  What's that thing? [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6226.12s)]
*  Instead of the sternum, it's their form of sternum. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6228.32s)]
*  Yeah, I guess, right? [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6231.24s)]
*  Yeah, because the sternum holes are two sides, [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6232.16s)]
*  left and right together. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6234.68s)]
*  Maybe it had surgery. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6236.52s)]
*  Maybe, yeah, it had surgery. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6237.360000000001s)]
*  The implant. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6238.84s)]
*  Jesus, yeah, maybe that's it's like neural link. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6239.68s)]
*  Where is this from? [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6241.8s)]
*  So this is, I was like digging more. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6243.64s)]
*  This is from this year. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6245.92s)]
*  Look at that one, look at that. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6247.76s)]
*  Show that to Dr. Gordon. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6248.88s)]
*  Look at the same thing, different finger, [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6251.200000000001s)]
*  the long fingers, long toes, same thing, three. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6253.68s)]
*  And real similar in the way they look. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6257.08s)]
*  So all these are coming out of Peru? [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6261.200000000001s)]
*  They all came from the same area. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6263.8s)]
*  When you disappeared, they said they've gotten close [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6266.52s)]
*  to two hundred different parts. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6269.0s)]
*  I didn't disappear, I'm here. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6269.84s)]
*  Well, you disappeared. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6270.68s)]
*  Yeah, I disappeared. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6271.52s)]
*  It just went to the bathroom, Jamie. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6272.360000000001s)]
*  I'm getting mad. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6273.400000000001s)]
*  I did disappear, I just had a pee, come on. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6274.240000000001s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6276.84s)]
*  Disapparacido. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6277.68s)]
*  It's like he left you. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6278.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6279.68s)]
*  Look at that X-ray of the skulls, [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6280.52s)]
*  the skeletons, though, rather. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6283.120000000001s)]
*  Those look real. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6284.52s)]
*  So fascinating. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6285.400000000001s)]
*  Those look real. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6286.92s)]
*  It looks very weird. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6287.76s)]
*  This is what I was seeing too. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6289.200000000001s)]
*  The videographer isn't known. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6290.240000000001s)]
*  They don't know who shot this video. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6293.36s)]
*  Well, it says the videographer behind the new footage [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6297.5199999999995s)]
*  is unknown in no small measure due to the thorny legal [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6300.0s)]
*  and ethical dimensions of handling these allegedly [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6302.96s)]
*  historical and culturally priceless ancient remains. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6305.2s)]
*  That makes sense. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6308.4s)]
*  I don't know exactly who shot the video, [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6309.839999999999s)]
*  but there are context clues in the longer version. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6311.08s)]
*  One source who had also been granted the tape [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6314.639999999999s)]
*  told DailyMail.com. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6319.639999999999s)]
*  They call them Huqueros, who has long been involved [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6321.44s)]
*  in the promotion of these Nazca mummies, [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6325.4s)]
*  was convicted of assault on public monuments [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6327.44s)]
*  for taking artifacts in 2022. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6330.08s)]
*  So if you take these artifacts, they go after you. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6331.879999999999s)]
*  The man received a four-year suspended sentence, [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6335.08s)]
*  was fined about 20,000 Peruvian sols, [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6337.16s)]
*  just $5,190 US dollars, according to Reuters. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6339.92s)]
*  A clear example of the high-risk extra legal measures [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6344.16s)]
*  some have taken to seek either truth or profit [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6346.96s)]
*  from these aliens. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6349.24s)]
*  That makes sense. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6350.0599999999995s)]
*  So it's dangerous to pull them out. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6350.9s)]
*  You can get in trouble. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6352.339999999999s)]
*  So then I think that's what I was getting to too, [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6353.74s)]
*  was the journalist has a lawsuit. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6355.9s)]

*  hoping to negotiate with Peru, as he put it, [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6363.5s)]
*  to be allowed to export the samples to be done in America. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6365.5s)]
*  The lawsuit is already in for $300 million. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6368.74s)]
*  Wow, explain he's pursuing monetary damages [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6372.0599999999995s)]
*  to repair his enterprise's damaged reputation, [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6374.299999999999s)]

*  and hookers and a Ferrari. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6380.14s)]
*  I want a Ferrari. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6382.820000000001s)]
*  Dr. McDowell himself has also recently pled [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6385.820000000001s)]

*  asking for official permission to study these specimens [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6393.1s)]
*  at top flight scientific facilities in the US. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6396.38s)]
*  Well, I like that. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6398.9800000000005s)]
*  I like that at least he's trying to get them, [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6400.14s)]
*  if it's true, that he's trying to get them studied. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6402.58s)]

*  who did find these things, [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6407.740000000001s)]
*  you would receive a tremendous amount of skepticism [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6409.18s)]

*  does that look like horse shit to you, or does it look real? [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6422.02s)]
*  No, it looks real. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6424.1s)]
*  I mean, the x-rays that you were showing. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6425.14s)]
*  You know, the fact that they came from NASCA [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6427.02s)]
*  with all those lines, and I know about it all. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6430.18s)]

*  don't really understand how they built it. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6437.18s)]
*  Correct. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6439.18s)]
*  Alison went there to Machu Picchu. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6441.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6443.58s)]
*  So she was chewing on... [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6444.42s)]
*  She was chewing on coca leaves. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6446.34s)]
*  And a candy, and so forth. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6448.18s)]
*  But I gave her Diamox. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6450.02s)]
*  I gave her Diamox so that she can acclimate. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6451.900000000001s)]
*  Diamox is the tablet you take to boost your... [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6455.22s)]
*  Cordyceps mushroom's good for that too. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6457.54s)]
*  There's a lot of things good for it. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6460.02s)]
*  This is a pharmaceutical pill. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6461.42s)]
*  But, you know, in my mind, [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6463.14s)]
*  knowing that it's NASCA lines [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6465.46s)]
*  and the association of possible aliens, [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6468.14s)]
*  and then finding these corpses coming from NASCA, [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6471.02s)]
*  you know, you put one and one together, [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6476.46s)]
*  and it makes sense that... [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6478.02s)]
*  Sorta. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6479.740000000001s)]
*  Sorta, yeah. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6480.58s)]
*  It also makes sense that if you were gonna hoax things, [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6481.42s)]
*  that's where you would hoax them. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6482.820000000001s)]
*  Correct, I got it. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6483.900000000001s)]
*  And that's skepticism that you have for it. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6485.02s)]
*  Well, I'm just being rational. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6488.06s)]
*  I'm not being skeptical. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6489.660000000001s)]
*  I'm honestly not skeptical. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6490.740000000001s)]
*  I'm kinda open-minded about it. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6491.9800000000005s)]
*  You don't believe that it's real? [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6493.66s)]
*  I don't know if it's real. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6494.5s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6495.34s)]
*  I like to think it's real, [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6496.179999999999s)]
*  but that's the problems that I really want to think it's real. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6497.0199999999995s)]
*  So what do you do? [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6498.86s)]
*  You say it's not real, but it looks real. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6499.7s)]
*  I don't say nothing. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6500.7s)]
*  Okay. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6501.54s)]
*  I just talk shit. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6502.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6503.219999999999s)]
*  That's what got to here. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6504.0599999999995s)]
*  That's what we're doing. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6506.0199999999995s)]
*  We're just talking shit. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6506.86s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6507.94s)]
*  I'm not an expert in biology. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6508.78s)]
*  I don't understand. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6510.0599999999995s)]
*  I mean, the skeleton looks real to me, [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6510.9s)]
*  but what do I know? [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6512.139999999999s)]
*  If I was gonna make a fake skeleton, [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6512.98s)]
*  could I do that with a bunch of discarded bones? [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6514.66s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6517.0599999999995s)]
*  What I'm skeptical about is the way the joints, [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6517.9s)]
*  they extend... [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6520.9s)]
*  On the fingers. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6521.74s)]
*  Yeah, but they look like ours, right? [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6523.58s)]
*  Like the same way... [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6525.0599999999995s)]
*  If you go back to that skeleton again, please. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6525.9s)]
*  Correct. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6528.139999999999s)]
*  If you look at it in the X-ray, [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6528.98s)]
*  what you see is the bones, [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6530.74s)]
*  they're formed, they're very similar [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6533.58s)]
*  to the way ours are formed. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6536.219999999999s)]
*  Correct. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6537.0599999999995s)]
*  Where at the end of it, [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6537.9s)]
*  not the one of the actual skeleton, Jamie. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6538.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6540.86s)]
*  So look at how the bones are at the top [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6541.7s)]
*  and where the joint is. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6543.0199999999995s)]
*  That looks like how our bones are. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6544.9s)]
*  Like the hinge in the joint of the elbow [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6546.9s)]
*  looks exactly like how a human's is, [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6549.5s)]
*  except it's one bone instead of two, [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6551.3s)]
*  which is, let's be honest, probably a better design. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6553.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6556.22s)]
*  The two bones, that little one, [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6557.06s)]
*  I broke that little one before. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6558.06s)]
*  You ever broke the little one? [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6559.22s)]
*  The little owner. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6560.06s)]
*  Yeah, I broke the fibula too. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6561.02s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6562.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6563.78s)]
*  The small one. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6564.62s)]
*  Yeah, the small one on the leg. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6565.46s)]
*  In a jiu-jitsu? [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6566.3s)]
*  No, kickboxing. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6568.3s)]
*  Kickboxing. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6569.14s)]
*  Not even checking a kick. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6569.9800000000005s)]
*  We were kicking at the same time [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6570.820000000001s)]
*  and a heel hit my shin. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6572.14s)]
*  It looks suggestive, okay, [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6574.18s)]
*  of it being something that might be real. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6576.7s)]
*  It definitely looks suggestive [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6579.62s)]
*  of something that might be real and very unique, right? [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6580.78s)]
*  Very different than our anatomy. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6583.0599999999995s)]
*  And it's our prejudice that says that, [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6585.139999999999s)]
*  oh, we're the only people here. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6586.86s)]
*  Well, I don't think that. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6588.54s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6589.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6590.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6591.46s)]
*  I think the possibility that something could be so advanced [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6592.3s)]
*  that all of our ideas of how it got here [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6597.34s)]
*  and how long it's been here are just silly. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6599.78s)]
*  I think we might be just like these people on the Amazon [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6602.58s)]
*  that my friend Paul Rosalie is running into. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6605.46s)]
*  They don't know that he goes on the Joe Rogan Experience [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6607.34s)]
*  and reaches 15 million people. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6610.02s)]
*  They don't have any idea. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6611.46s)]
*  They have no idea. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6612.700000000001s)]
*  So what do they see? [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6613.540000000001s)]
*  They see some guy with clothes on. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6614.9800000000005s)]
*  Like, what's this asshole doing? [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6616.620000000001s)]
*  And he's out there in the Amazon. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6617.860000000001s)]
*  And then he takes a picture. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6620.38s)]
*  And their experience with him is probably kind of similar [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6622.3s)]
*  to our experience, [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6627.9800000000005s)]
*  but except much more exaggerated with aliens. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6629.26s)]
*  Like if you came into contact with something [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6632.06s)]
*  that's a million years more advanced than us, [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6634.620000000001s)]
*  like what would that contact be like? [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6637.26s)]
*  I mean, are we so limited in our understanding [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6639.700000000001s)]
*  of how you move through the universe [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6643.540000000001s)]
*  that we assume that everything has to use rockets [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6647.38s)]
*  and everything has to burn fuel and shoot things [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6650.22s)]
*  and to defy gravity by pushing against it? [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6652.820000000001s)]
*  Maybe not. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6656.5s)]
*  Maybe there's much more advanced propulsion systems [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6657.34s)]
*  that exist. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6659.900000000001s)]
*  These are the hands? [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6661.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they're dissecting it. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6662.46s)]
*  They're dissecting it. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6663.820000000001s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6664.820000000001s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6665.66s)]
*  What the fuck, man? [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6667.98s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6670.9s)]
*  Yeah, the dissection. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6672.26s)]
*  They'll know. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6673.58s)]
*  That looks like weird bones in a hand. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6674.86s)]
*  That's creepy. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6677.9s)]
*  That's so creepy. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6680.86s)]
*  Look at their skin. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6681.74s)]
*  I mean, obviously mummified, but how fucking weird. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6683.099999999999s)]
*  How weird. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6686.58s)]
*  Look at the bones underneath it. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6687.42s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6688.7s)]
*  That is so crazy. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6690.74s)]
*  And you're gonna tell me, [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6692.139999999999s)]
*  someone put this together as a joke. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6693.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6695.82s)]
*  I mean, I'm looking at this. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6696.66s)]
*  I don't know who's a part of this, [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6697.74s)]
*  but when he peels that back and you see those bones again, [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6700.58s)]
*  that is fucking nuts. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6703.62s)]
*  That's so wild. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6706.54s)]
*  But also, why are those bones so clear for a mummified thing? [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6708.9s)]
*  Those bones look, in my mind, they don't look mummified. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6713.82s)]
*  They look like more recent. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6716.419999999999s)]
*  But what do I know? [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6718.339999999999s)]
*  It almost looks wet. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6719.54s)]
*  Go back to that image. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6720.5s)]
*  Yeah, it was wet. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6721.339999999999s)]
*  The other thing was shiny too. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6722.66s)]
*  Right, so is that because they put something on it? [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6724.06s)]
*  Or is that what happens when you cut that thing open? [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6728.18s)]
*  I'm trying to find a longer video [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6731.46s)]
*  and see if I can figure out how they did it. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6732.5s)]
*  Them putting distilled water on it [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6734.06s)]
*  during the process of dissecting it. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6735.780000000001s)]
*  Maybe they're trying to clean off the bones [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6739.66s)]
*  and they did something to it to brush it [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6741.42s)]
*  and put water on it there. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6743.1s)]
*  Whatever that is. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6744.820000000001s)]
*  How old did they say that that was? [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6745.66s)]
*  That's a good question. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6747.66s)]
*  Did they carbon date it? [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6748.5s)]
*  Or? [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6749.7s)]
*  See, that would be the thing to do, [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6751.54s)]
*  is to carbon date it to find out [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6752.86s)]
*  whether or not if it's that old, [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6754.22s)]
*  then it should be petrified [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6756.46s)]
*  and therefore it shouldn't look like that. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6758.26s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6759.94s)]
*  Like if it's a million years old. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6760.86s)]
*  If it's a million years old. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6761.9s)]
*  But if it's only 500 years old, [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6762.74s)]
*  then things get real weird. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6764.46s)]
*  It's a totally different story. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6765.3s)]
*  So the way that the bones should look. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6766.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird as shit. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6767.9s)]
*  But the thing is, there's so many people [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6770.5s)]
*  that essentially make a living off of lying. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6772.22s)]
*  They make a living off of bullshitting. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6776.46s)]
*  There's a lot of that going on. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6780.58s)]
*  So religiously, I mean, [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6782.14s)]
*  looking from a religious standpoint, [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6784.26s)]
*  what's the impact of acknowledging [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6786.14s)]
*  that there are other species in extraterrestrials? [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6788.42s)]
*  What's the impact on religion here in the United States? [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6793.34s)]
*  Or here in the world? [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6795.86s)]
*  Depends on which religion you're talking about. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6797.54s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6799.54s)]
*  I think the Vatican has been pretty open [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6801.18s)]
*  to the idea that we're not alone [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6803.0599999999995s)]
*  and that God could possibly have created other life forms. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6805.0199999999995s)]
*  See if that's true. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6808.42s)]
*  I'm pretty sure that's true. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6809.3s)]
*  I think the Vatican gave a statement [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6810.14s)]
*  within the last decade or so about this. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6812.42s)]
*  But they probably know some shit, right? [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6815.34s)]
*  They probably have it. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6817.22s)]
*  They know a lot of ancient books. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6818.22s)]
*  You've seen some of the Russian stuff. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6819.62s)]
*  You've seen some of the Russian studies [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6821.46s)]
*  where they had aliens who crashed in a flying saucer [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6823.66s)]
*  and they abused the aliens. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6826.9400000000005s)]
*  Vatican astronomer says if aliens exist, [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6829.9400000000005s)]
*  they may not need redemption. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6832.02s)]
*  Oh, that's cool. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6833.780000000001s)]
*  Jesus gave them a fucking hall pass. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6836.38s)]
*  Lest it be those who come from other planets. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6838.42s)]
*  They may be a different life form [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6840.7s)]
*  that does not need Christ's redemption, [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6842.02s)]
*  the Vatican chief astronomer said. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6843.9400000000005s)]
*  That makes sense. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6846.54s)]
*  I mean, if they came from somewhere else. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6847.82s)]
*  Difficult to exclude the possibility [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6849.58s)]
*  that other intelligent life exists in the universe, [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6851.38s)]
*  he noted that one field of astronomy [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6853.46s)]
*  is now actively seeking biomarkers [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6855.18s)]
*  and spectrum analysis of other stars and planets. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6857.46s)]
*  That's true. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6859.7s)]
*  They definitely have done that. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6860.54s)]
*  These potential forms of life could include those [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6861.82s)]
*  that have no need of oxygen or hydrogen, he said. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6864.26s)]
*  Just as God created multiple forms of life on Earth, [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6869.02s)]
*  he said, there may be diverse forms [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6871.700000000001s)]
*  throughout the universe. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6873.740000000001s)]
*  That makes sense. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6874.58s)]
*  That's an open-minded religious person. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6875.42s)]
*  It's not in contrast with faith [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6877.06s)]
*  because we cannot place limits [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6879.1s)]
*  on the creative freedom of God. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6880.4800000000005s)]
*  That makes sense. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6882.46s)]
*  Yeah, if you're gonna be logical [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6883.58s)]
*  and be a believer in God, that's the way to do it, right? [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6885.38s)]
*  To say, look, if God exists, [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6889.34s)]
*  we just might be too limited in our understanding [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6891.82s)]
*  of the world to think that, [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6894.9s)]
*  we think that God just made us and this is it, [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6896.82s)]
*  but it might be God has made life [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6898.98s)]
*  all throughout the universe. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6900.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6901.94s)]
*  If you believe in God, you have to accept the fact [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6902.78s)]
*  that he's on other planets. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6905.74s)]
*  We're not the exclusivity. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6907.54s)]
*  Maybe God is the universe. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6909.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, that's what they've been saying. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6910.94s)]
*  God is the universe. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6912.299999999999s)]
*  The universe is God, yeah, which makes sense [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6913.139999999999s)]
*  because the universe is a creative force. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6915.219999999999s)]
*  It makes things constantly. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6916.7s)]
*  It's constantly making stars. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6918.58s)]
*  Stellar nurseries and planets. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6920.700000000001s)]
*  So what's your take on Bigfoot these days? [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6923.02s)]
*  I think Bigfoot is mostly nonsense. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6925.860000000001s)]
*  That is sort of a historical memory. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6927.860000000001s)]
*  I think for sure we know that Gigantopithecus [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6932.9400000000005s)]
*  was a real animal that coexisted with human beings. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6935.9800000000005s)]
*  And we know that, what's the date of Gigantopithecus? [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6939.46s)]
*  It's more than hundreds of thousands of years, right? [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6944.9800000000005s)]
*  But it just makes sense that if human beings [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6947.86s)]
*  have been around for that long [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6950.299999999999s)]
*  and that thing's been around for that long, [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6951.46s)]
*  and then... [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6953.259999999999s)]
*  Gigantopithecus? [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6954.34s)]
*  200,000 years ago. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6955.66s)]
*  Two million to approximately 300,000 to 200,000 years ago. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6956.82s)]
*  So as recently as possibly 200,000 years ago, [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6960.259999999999s)]
*  but that's essentially based on what they found. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6963.48s)]
*  Now they're constantly finding new things, right? [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6966.179999999999s)]
*  So like they didn't even know Denisovans were a thing, [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6968.5199999999995s)]
*  which is a new type of human. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6971.5s)]
*  Is that the gigantic ones? [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6974.139999999999s)]
*  No, they're not gigantic. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6975.7s)]
*  They're just a different, [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6977.419999999999s)]

*  When did they discover Denisovans? [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6989.0s)]
*  That recent. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6991.139999999999s)]
*  I think they discovered them in Russia, [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6991.98s)]
*  and they found them in China, [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6993.66s)]
*  and so they know that there's that. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6994.98s)]
*  And then there was another species [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6997.0199999999995s)]
*  that they found recently that's even more recent, [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=6998.9s)]
*  that's large headed people that were, [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7001.66s)]
*  they had larger heads than us that existed with us. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7004.74s)]

*  When they discovered that? [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7029.82s)]
*  Well, they were super recent. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7031.12s)]
*  They lived, I think, 75,000 years ago, [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7033.22s)]

*  They had, it's one piece they found. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7041.06s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7042.900000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7048.38s)]
*  You're right, there's a lot of shit [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7049.22s)]

*  but one of the things that I read was they found bones [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7053.780000000001s)]
*  of people that were like. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7056.900000000001s)]

*  I've never seen any evidence. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7061.320000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't dismiss it. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7062.58s)]
*  There's giants in the Bible, [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7064.22s)]
*  there's giants in historical record. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7065.38s)]
*  Goliath. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7067.18s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7068.02s)]
*  It's completely possible that if you have pygmies [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7068.9800000000005s)]
*  and you have, you know about the Hobbit people [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7071.9800000000005s)]
*  on the island of Flores? [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7075.38s)]
*  No. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7076.9800000000005s)]
*  You didn't know about that? [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7077.82s)]
*  No, but they're Hobbit. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7078.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think they call them homo-florescissus. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7079.86s)]
*  And what these are is these little tiny ape-like humanoids [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7084.5s)]
*  that lived alongside people. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7089.66s)]
*  I think they've dated them to 100,000 years ago. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7092.5s)]
*  Might be earlier. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7096.3s)]
*  At one point in time, I think they thought [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7097.3s)]
*  it was 10,000 years ago, but I think they pushed it back. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7098.66s)]
*  But these were like another branch of the human tree [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7102.1s)]
*  and they were really tiny and they used tools [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7105.78s)]
*  and they hunted and they think that, you know, [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7108.28s)]
*  that they were probably wiped out, at least partially. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7111.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7114.18s)]
*  Homo-florescissus. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7115.3s)]
*  Florescissus. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7117.9s)]
*  And that's what they looked like. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7119.860000000001s)]
*  And they lived alongside us. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7120.700000000001s)]
*  So they think that might be a case [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7124.18s)]
*  of island dwarfism as well. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7126.22s)]
*  You know, like there's a thing that happens to mammals [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7128.820000000001s)]
*  when they're on islands where they get smaller. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7131.58s)]
*  And weirdly enough, reptiles get larger. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7133.9400000000005s)]
*  That's why you have Komodo dragons. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7138.38s)]
*  Love them. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7140.4800000000005s)]
*  Pretty cool, right? [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7141.46s)]
*  So there's homo-sapien and there's homo-florescissus. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7142.3s)]
*  Monster lizards. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7144.54s)]
*  There's like a bunch of different types of humans [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7146.38s)]
*  that existed and we were the most clever [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7149.9800000000005s)]
*  and the most vicious. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7152.02s)]

*  It's the calvarium, the size of the skull [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7159.5s)]

*  Imagine running into that dude. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7266.219999999999s)]
*  No. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7267.62s)]
*  Back in the day. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7268.62s)]
*  He's dead. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7269.46s)]
*  That's probably why. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7270.299999999999s)]
*  Look at him. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7271.46s)]
*  Yo, yo, bigger. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7272.299999999999s)]
*  This is where the AI photos are helping. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7274.139999999999s)]
*  AI is awesome. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7274.98s)]
*  Yeah, AI is awesome. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7276.139999999999s)]
*  Look at that, make that bigger. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7277.86s)]
*  Look how fucking cool they looked. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7281.299999999999s)]
*  Bro, could you imagine walking through the jungle [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7284.0199999999995s)]
*  and running into these dudes, like a bunch of them? [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7287.299999999999s)]
*  Yo. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7289.78s)]
*  What do you want? [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7291.58s)]
*  Look at it, imagine. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7294.0199999999995s)]
*  There is so much more to be found. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7296.139999999999s)]
*  Well, just in our own history, right? [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7298.78s)]
*  The history of Earth, the different forms of life [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7300.94s)]
*  that don't exist anymore. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7303.54s)]
*  And there's so much variety [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7305.139999999999s)]
*  that it really does make you wonder, [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7307.0199999999995s)]
*  what are we seeing? [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7308.94s)]
*  We're seeing these alien bones that they're X-raying. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7310.139999999999s)]
*  What are we seeing when people report [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7312.98s)]
*  that they're experiencing contact with these entities? [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7316.0199999999995s)]
*  Are they from another dimension? [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7319.34s)]
*  Are they from another planet? [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7320.66s)]
*  Is everybody crazy? [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7322.099999999999s)]
*  Is everybody just making things up? [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7324.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7325.62s)]
*  How do you account for all the people [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7326.46s)]
*  that said that I've been taken? [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7328.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's very compelling. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7330.94s)]
*  I've been taken. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7332.02s)]
*  It's very compelling, but here's the question. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7332.86s)]
*  Were they physically taken? [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7334.54s)]
*  Here's the question. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7335.9s)]
*  The realm of dreams is a gigantic mystery, [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7337.02s)]
*  and the realm of dreams is hyper-realistic sometimes. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7340.54s)]
*  I had a hyper-realistic dream last night. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7343.42s)]
*  I wish I could remember what it was, [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7346.14s)]
*  but it's one of those things. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7347.54s)]
*  It was crazy, but I got up in the middle of the night, [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7348.82s)]
*  I woke me up, and then I got up to pee, [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7352.0199999999995s)]
*  and I was like, what the fuck is wrong with me? [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7353.5s)]
*  And then I went back to sleep. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7355.459999999999s)]
*  But while I was experiencing that dream, [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7356.54s)]
*  I remember being aware that it was a dream eventually, [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7359.54s)]
*  but while it was all going down, [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7364.459999999999s)]
*  I was like, this is a crazy dream. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7365.78s)]
*  Like thinking, this is so vivid and so realistic. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7368.66s)]
*  So if you live in a dream for the rest of your life, [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7371.74s)]
*  you are still alive, and you are still experiencing things. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7375.78s)]
*  You're just experiencing things in a non-physical way, [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7379.14s)]
*  the way we interact with reality today. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7383.02s)]
*  So you and I are interacting with reality [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7385.820000000001s)]
*  with a couple glasses of whiskey, a cigar, [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7387.900000000001s)]
*  we have a wooden table, we're talking into microphones. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7390.3s)]
*  But the reality that you interact with in dreams [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7393.22s)]
*  is it's not tangible. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7396.860000000001s)]
*  It's existing, you're experiencing it, [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7400.26s)]
*  but it's in some other realm. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7402.700000000001s)]
*  It's some realm of the mind and some realm of consciousness, [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7404.18s)]
*  and maybe what you're doing is accessing [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7408.26s)]
*  a dimension of possibilities [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7410.900000000001s)]
*  that is entirely created by consciousness. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7413.14s)]
*  And maybe there's multiple layers to that, [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7415.900000000001s)]
*  and things can come from other places to us that way. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7419.46s)]
*  It's always been interesting to me [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7424.3s)]
*  that these people that have these abduction experiences, [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7426.1s)]
*  it seems like the vast majority. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7429.5s)]
*  I've read Abducted, which is John Mack's book, [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7431.22s)]
*  and I'm aware of the Betty and Barney Hill story, [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7434.22s)]
*  and this is Travis Walton, [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7439.66s)]
*  the guy who got abducted in Arizona. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7441.900000000001s)]
*  That's the black and white couple. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7443.14s)]
*  No, no, Betty and Barney Hill. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7444.66s)]
*  Benny Barney Hill. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7446.1s)]
*  Actually, Angela Hill, who's the granddaughter of them, [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7447.02s)]
*  is a UFC fighter. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7449.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, really? Yeah. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7451.3s)]
*  She was on the podcast and didn't tell me that [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7452.42s)]
*  until after the podcast was over. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7454.780000000001s)]
*  I'm like, damn! [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7456.06s)]
*  Was your grandfather? Great conversation, yeah. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7457.66s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7459.18s)]
*  Her grandfather was Barney Hill. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7460.02s)]
*  So these people all have very compelling stories. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7462.46s)]
*  Now, the difference between Travis Walton's story [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7465.9s)]
*  and the other stories is people saw Travis Walton [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7468.42s)]
*  go up to that UFO. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7471.78s)]
*  Travis Walton disappeared for five days. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7473.66s)]
*  Travis Walton came back from being in the woods [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7475.82s)]
*  for five days with this crazy story. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7478.26s)]
*  And the other people, most of them, it happens at night. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7480.46s)]
*  And so when you're dreaming, [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7485.0199999999995s)]
*  who knows what the fuck is really happening? [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7487.3s)]
*  And if you're lying in bed and you get abducted by aliens [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7489.38s)]
*  and they return you to your bed, what really happened? [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7492.38s)]
*  Is there a video of you disappearing? [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7496.06s)]
*  Or if we had a video in that room, [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7497.9800000000005s)]
*  would you have the same experience [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7500.66s)]
*  but your physical body never goes anywhere? [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7502.34s)]
*  So what are you really experiencing? [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7504.46s)]
*  That's the question. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7506.66s)]
*  And I'm not doubting that these people [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7507.5s)]
*  have something happen to them. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7509.860000000001s)]
*  But we do know that when people are dreaming, [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7511.74s)]
*  there's an endogenous release of psychedelic chemicals. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7514.74s)]
*  There's this crazy experience of dreams [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7518.06s)]
*  and of vivid dreams and lucid dreams. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7521.46s)]
*  So what is that? [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7524.1s)]
*  And if that is something that can be traversed, [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7525.22s)]
*  is that something that someone can enter into? [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7529.860000000001s)]
*  Is it possible that other intelligence [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7532.900000000001s)]
*  that's different than ours, that's more advanced than ours, [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7535.620000000001s)]
*  that lives in a different dimension than ours [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7538.740000000001s)]
*  has access to the mind in these exchanges? [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7540.5s)]
*  Yeah, in the subconscious. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7544.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and maybe even physically. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7546.26s)]
*  I'm not even dismissing physical contact. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7548.78s)]
*  But I'm just saying that many of these cases [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7551.099999999999s)]
*  where people claim to have been abducted happen at night. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7553.259999999999s)]
*  I don't think that is a coincidence. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7557.0199999999995s)]
*  I think the realm of consciousness is, [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7559.7s)]
*  I think we're very arrogant in our belief [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7563.46s)]
*  that we understand what's going on [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7565.94s)]
*  with how we interface with reality. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7567.74s)]
*  No, we don't. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7569.94s)]
*  We know we have things that we count on [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7571.179999999999s)]
*  because every time I come here, [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7573.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm pretty sure the same garbage is gonna be on this table, [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7574.46s)]
*  it's gonna be the same. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7576.5s)]
*  But I don't think we're really sure [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7578.42s)]
*  with how consciousness interacts with the world [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7580.46s)]
*  and how much of it is real. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7582.9s)]
*  I agree. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7584.26s)]
*  In the subconscious space, the question is, [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7585.62s)]
*  is that when the extraterrestrials [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7589.54s)]
*  invades our space, our psychiatric space, [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7593.22s)]
*  and therefore gives to us in our brain [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7596.54s)]
*  the perception of everything that we perceive, [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7602.7s)]
*  meaning the alien, the... [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7605.62s)]
*  Maybe even Bigfoot. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7609.82s)]
*  Whatever, everything. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7611.74s)]
*  But maybe that's what Bigfoot is. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7612.74s)]
*  Yeah, but you think so? [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7614.14s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7616.34s)]
*  I mean, maybe it's something- [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7617.18s)]
*  That's our perception, unconscious? [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7618.0199999999995s)]
*  Maybe it's something you're experiencing [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7619.5s)]
*  that's from somewhere else. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7621.34s)]
*  Or maybe it's your consciousness [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7623.0199999999995s)]
*  interacting with reality in a completely alien environment [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7625.099999999999s)]
*  that is guaranteed to give you a heightened sense of anxiety. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7628.9s)]
*  The woods at night. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7631.82s)]
*  A lot of these people are experiencing these things [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7633.9s)]
*  in the woods at night. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7635.58s)]
*  Maybe there's a level of consciousness you reach [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7636.42s)]
*  under those circumstances where you interact with things [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7639.339999999999s)]
*  that you ordinarily cannot interact with. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7642.5s)]
*  And maybe that's why there's a lack of physical evidence [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7644.7s)]
*  in our dimension. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7649.099999999999s)]
*  The physical evidence in our dimension is very limited. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7650.74s)]
*  One thing that's compelling, [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7653.9s)]
*  and maybe the only thing that's compelling, [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7655.139999999999s)]
*  is dermal ridges that they find on these footprints. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7656.74s)]
*  So they find these footprints in muck, [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7659.62s)]
*  like where they step in mud and muck and stuff, [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7661.5s)]
*  and they leave behind not just footprints, [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7664.14s)]
*  but footprints with dermal ridges like fingerprints, [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7667.62s)]
*  which is very difficult to fake, [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7670.62s)]
*  especially in the 1970s and the 1980s, [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7672.42s)]
*  where some of these things were required. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7674.98s)]
*  So it's like, I don't know what we're dealing with, [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7676.98s)]
*  but there's enough people that talk about that experience [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7679.34s)]
*  and it makes you pause. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7681.62s)]
*  I don't believe, but I don't disbelieve. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7684.02s)]
*  And as far as Bigfoot being an actual large ape [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7686.46s)]
*  that lives undisturbed in the Pacific Northwest, [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7691.3s)]
*  I'm very skeptical because there's too many hunters now, [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7694.42s)]
*  too many people with cameras and too many camera traps. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7697.74s)]
*  There's too many cell phone cameras, [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7700.54s)]
*  where the trail cameras snap things that are going by. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7702.9800000000005s)]
*  Wildlife biologists use them. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7706.26s)]
*  We know of a couple of jaguars that exist [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7708.1s)]
*  in the United States, and the reason why we know about them [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7710.46s)]
*  is because of trail cameras. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7712.66s)]
*  So the fact that there's zero trail camera footage that's... [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7714.06s)]
*  Hylian. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7717.5s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't... [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7718.34s)]
*  The Bigfoot thing is like maybe, [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7719.86s)]
*  but maybe you're interacting [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7722.299999999999s)]
*  with something that's not physical. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7724.94s)]
*  It might be something that's interdimensional [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7726.82s)]
*  or something that you... [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7728.94s)]
*  You might be looking at the past. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7730.179999999999s)]
*  You might be interacting with whatever experience [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7732.86s)]
*  this thing has had many, many, many, many years ago. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7738.5s)]
*  It's like left echoes. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7742.58s)]
*  It might be echoes in space, echoes in time, [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7745.339999999999s)]
*  and that under certain states, [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7749.38s)]
*  you can briefly access these echoes, [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7750.9400000000005s)]
*  briefly access these things that may have existed [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7753.42s)]
*  or might exist in other dimensions. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7758.1s)]
*  I'm not ruling it out. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7763.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7763.9800000000005s)]
*  I wouldn't bet the house on it. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7764.82s)]
*  Wow. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7765.66s)]
*  I wouldn't bet the house on it, but... [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7766.5s)]
*  That sounds like... [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7767.9400000000005s)]
*  I do think there's a lot of bullshit artists too, though. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7768.78s)]
*  I've talked to a lot of Bigfoot people [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7770.06s)]
*  that are bullshit artists. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7771.82s)]
*  Yeah, the balance that obviously you're talking about [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7772.66s)]
*  is the fact that there are so many people [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7775.42s)]
*  who are trying to present the factual evidence [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7778.46s)]
*  that it exists, that causes you to doubt it. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7782.9s)]
*  So, you know, I believe that there's a possibility [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7787.46s)]
*  of all the things that we talked about [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7792.26s)]
*  from Bigfoot to aliens and so forth, [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7794.1s)]
*  but there's a tempered perception of it as being reality [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7797.5s)]
*  that it might be there, but we would rather deny it [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7801.9s)]
*  as opposed to accept it, [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7806.3s)]
*  because what happens if you accept it as 100% truth? [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7807.860000000001s)]
*  What is the mindset on it? [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7812.54s)]
*  Well, you can't accept it as 100% truth [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7813.38s)]
*  unless you have 100% evidence. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7815.42s)]
*  Yeah, you wanna have physical evidence, [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7817.38s)]
*  but we don't have it, so until we have... [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7820.3s)]
*  You know who believes in them? [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7821.58s)]
*  Pardon? [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7822.820000000001s)]
*  You know who really believes in Bigfoot? [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7823.66s)]
*  No. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7824.66s)]
*  Jane Goodall. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7825.5s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7826.34s)]
*  Which is wild. The gorilla lady. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7827.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7828.18s)]
*  Did you ever hear her talk about it? [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7829.02s)]
*  No, why does she believe in it? [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7830.14s)]
*  She believes from all the eyewitness sightings [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7831.66s)]
*  and the possibility and her time living with primates. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7834.98s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7838.0199999999995s)]
*  See if you can find Jane Goodall talking about it, [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7838.86s)]
*  because when she talks about it, [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7840.74s)]
*  she talks about it with great enthusiasm. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7841.66s)]
*  It's really interesting. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7843.74s)]
*  Okay, enthusiasm with facts to back it up [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7844.58s)]
*  or just the large number of people who have stated [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7848.259999999999s)]
*  that they've seen it or experienced it or... [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7851.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7855.62s)]
*  One thing though is when she was saying this [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7856.82s)]
*  was quite a while ago, more than a decade or two ago, [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7858.86s)]
*  and I think that over time, when there's still no evidence, [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7862.14s)]
*  people get more and more skeptical. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7866.02s)]
*  I've talked to a bunch of people [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7868.14s)]
*  that have had Bigfoot experiences. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7869.46s)]
*  I don't necessarily believe any of them. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7870.780000000001s)]
*  I don't disbelieve them, but I'm just like, [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7873.9800000000005s)]
*  there's not one story. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7875.42s)]
*  I've talked to UFO abduction people, and I believe them. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7876.42s)]
*  I believe them. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7879.700000000001s)]
*  You believe them. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7880.54s)]
*  Yeah, I believe Travis Walton. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7881.38s)]
*  I talked to that guy. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7882.22s)]
*  He does not seem like a bullshit artist, [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7883.06s)]
*  and he hasn't changed his story in fucking 30 years. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7884.46s)]
*  It's Bigfoot. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7887.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7888.34s)]
*  That's Goodall. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7889.18s)]
*  Everybody talks to me about it. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7890.02s)]
*  I'm romantic. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7892.14s)]
*  I would like Bigfoot to exist. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7892.9800000000005s)]
*  I've met people who swear they've seen Bigfoot, [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7894.9800000000005s)]
*  and I think the interesting thing is [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7898.22s)]
*  every single continent, there is an equivalent [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7899.86s)]
*  of Bigfoot or Sasquatch. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7903.9s)]
*  There's the Yeti, there's the Yari in Australia, [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7905.58s)]
*  there's the Chinese wild man, and on and on and on. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7908.5s)]
*  And I've had stories from people who... [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7913.18s)]
*  You have to believe them. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7917.5s)]
*  So there's something. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7919.46s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7922.14s)]
*  I'm always open-minded. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7922.9800000000005s)]
*  What about other... [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7925.06s)]
*  Yep. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7926.900000000001s)]
*  Supposedly mythological, I guess I should say, [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7928.22s)]
*  like the Loch Ness Monster. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7930.34s)]
*  The Loch Ness Monster obviously doesn't exist. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7931.9800000000005s)]
*  Why? [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7935.34s)]
*  Alien beings, what are you saying? [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7936.46s)]
*  I don't. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7937.78s)]
*  I think that it doesn't make sense to think [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7938.62s)]
*  we're the only intelligent form of life. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7941.74s)]
*  This wall that was built between us, [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7944.06s)]
*  we're just the only really intelligent capable [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7946.7s)]
*  of this, that, and the other. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7949.74s)]
*  Difference in kind between us and the other animals, [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7951.58s)]
*  that wall is broken down, [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7954.18s)]
*  and the chimps helped to break it down. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7956.18s)]
*  The chimps helped to break it down. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7959.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, her experience with chimps, [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7961.18s)]
*  she's been embedded with chimps. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7962.98s)]
*  I definitely don't not believe, [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7968.26s)]
*  like I said, don't disbelieve. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7970.74s)]
*  It's not like aliens aren't real. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7972.26s)]
*  UFOs aren't real, it's all lies. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7973.7s)]
*  All the people are lying. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7975.34s)]
*  I don't think that at all. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7976.18s)]
*  I think reality is weird. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7977.66s)]
*  I think it's weirder than our senses [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7981.42s)]
*  are capable of detecting. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7983.22s)]
*  That's what I think. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7984.78s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7985.74s)]
*  I tend to be more on the side that they exist [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7986.94s)]
*  until you prove that they don't exist. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7990.3s)]
*  You know what's really weird is underwater aliens. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7992.78s)]
*  Underwater extraterrestrials or underwater UAPs. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7995.62s)]
*  I don't know about cities. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=7999.94s)]
*  Are cities under there? [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8000.78s)]
*  Yeah, cities where they have their spaceships [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8001.62s)]
*  at the trenches in the trenches. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8004.86s)]
*  I've never seen any data. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8008.3s)]
*  No. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8009.14s)]
*  See, that's the point. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8009.9800000000005s)]
*  There's video of things moving underwater [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8011.7s)]
*  at very high rates of speed. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8014.78s)]
*  In fact, some of the whistleblowers, [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8016.9s)]
*  and again, how much that's real, [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8019.26s)]
*  but some of the whistleblowers from the government [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8021.78s)]
*  have claimed that they have detected things underwater [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8024.06s)]
*  that are enormous, like the size of a football field, [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8027.26s)]
*  and they're moving 500 knots underwater [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8029.54s)]
*  with no visible means of propulsion. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8033.06s)]
*  Correct. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8035.38s)]
*  They think that this is where they hide in plain sight. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8036.54s)]
*  They just exist in the water. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8039.14s)]
*  So those videos that have come out recently [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8040.78s)]
*  of the Navy aid theaters who have chased UFOs [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8043.38s)]
*  that have gone into the water, [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8048.06s)]
*  and they've seen these large reflections [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8049.78s)]
*  under the water of huge spaceships and so forth. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8051.94s)]
*  Pardon me. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8056.18s)]
*  I haven't heard any of like, [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8057.02s)]
*  I've heard there was the Commander David Fravor, [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8058.3s)]
*  the Tic Tac event where there was this thing [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8061.86s)]
*  that was like 20 foot wide. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8064.94s)]
*  It looked like a Tic Tac. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8066.5s)]
*  And they think there was something under it in the water. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8068.099999999999s)]
*  There was a disturbance that looked like [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8071.0199999999995s)]
*  an underwater submarine that's emerging [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8074.179999999999s)]
*  or reaching the top of the surface. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8076.419999999999s)]
*  And then when they were flying near it, it went down. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8078.259999999999s)]
*  And then there's been other people, other pilots, [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8081.0199999999995s)]
*  that have actually seen large physical crafts in the water. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8083.0599999999995s)]
*  But again, I've never seen any photos [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8088.0599999999995s)]
*  that are compelling of that. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8090.9s)]
*  So the chasing of a UAP that went into the water. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8091.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8095.98s)]
*  Is that real or is that a figment? [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8096.82s)]
*  Well, that wasn't chased. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8098.66s)]
*  What they call those, what do they call them? [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8099.74s)]
*  Extra medium and intermediate. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8103.0199999999995s)]
*  Transmedium, they call them transmedium crafts, [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8106.0199999999995s)]
*  which means they can fly in the air [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8108.219999999999s)]
*  and they can fly through the water. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8109.7s)]
*  They have seen things dunk into the water. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8111.78s)]
*  They have video of one, but it's very grainy. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8114.259999999999s)]
*  It's very grainy night vision, [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8116.78s)]
*  thermal vision of this thing, dunking into the water. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8118.66s)]
*  And then they don't know what happened. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8122.62s)]
*  Then it came out of the water. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8123.46s)]
*  It was flying around again. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8124.3s)]
*  They don't know what the fuck that is. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8125.5s)]
*  They're just guessing. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8127.46s)]
*  And looking at the physics of it, [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8129.0599999999995s)]
*  the fact that it was able to do a 90 degree change in motion [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8130.58s)]
*  and then down into the water and then coming up. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8135.219999999999s)]
*  How do you account for that? [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8138.62s)]
*  You don't. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8139.58s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8140.42s)]
*  The really crazy one is the Tic Tac. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8141.259999999999s)]
*  Because the Tic Tac, [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8142.62s)]
*  they have a bunch of different types of data. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8143.46s)]
*  They have, first of all, the pilots who saw it, [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8146.86s)]
*  they have the video from the pilots' cabins. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8148.66s)]
*  They have this radar footage that tracked this thing [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8151.9800000000005s)]
*  going from above 50,000 miles to 50 feet in one second. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8154.9800000000005s)]
*  They don't know how the fuck anything can do that. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8160.74s)]
*  And then it takes off, when they video it, [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8162.74s)]
*  this thing taking off from their visual, [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8165.34s)]
*  from their recording, their screens, [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8167.78s)]
*  it takes off at such an insane rate of speed. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8169.86s)]
*  They said anything biological [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8171.62s)]
*  would just be turned to jelly instantly. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8173.02s)]
*  Killed because of the momentum. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8174.7s)]
*  The G-force would just be insane. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8176.18s)]
*  It's just insane rates of speed. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8177.7s)]
*  And no visible means of propulsion. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8179.58s)]
*  It does it from a completely stationary perspective [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8181.98s)]
*  and then just takes off. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8184.82s)]
*  Yeah, they've talked about dimensional, [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8187.54s)]
*  the fact that those unidentified flying objects, [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8190.38s)]
*  they go into a different dimension as well. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8194.46s)]
*  Maybe a different dementia too. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8198.78s)]
*  Dementia, yeah dementia. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8199.9s)]
*  They're in a state of dementia. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8201.18s)]
*  Yeah, this is the one that goes in the water. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8202.38s)]
*  So look how grainy this is. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8204.46s)]
*  It's like, what am I looking at? [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8205.62s)]
*  So the fact that it's grainy means what? [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8206.46s)]
*  Well, they're just looking at it from a long distance [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8209.26s)]
*  with aircraft optics. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8211.78s)]
*  So these are weapon optics, right? [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8215.34s)]
*  So grainy-ness means it's less possible. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8217.460000000001s)]
*  Well, it's dark out. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8220.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8220.94s)]
*  Well, it's dark out. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8221.78s)]
*  And this is how they're seeing this thing. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8222.6s)]
*  And then it just goes into the water. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8223.44s)]
*  And then if you hear it, you hear the recording, [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8224.9s)]
*  hear the recording, Jamie? [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8227.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8228.26s)]
*  Top side. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8229.1s)]
*  Listen to them freak out when it. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8229.94s)]
*  Yeah, they're freaking. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8231.02s)]
*  Splash, splash. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8232.380000000001s)]
*  Mark Barrier range. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8233.460000000001s)]
*  Right into the water. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8234.300000000001s)]
*  So the thing went into the water [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8236.1s)]
*  and then also went out of the water. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8237.7s)]
*  Just tic-tac. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8238.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8239.660000000002s)]
*  But the thing is, how many of these things are ours? [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8240.86s)]
*  Not zero. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8245.740000000002s)]
*  How many of these things? [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8247.26s)]
*  Have you ever seen that underwater drone [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8248.18s)]
*  that the United States has developed? [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8249.7s)]
*  No, I haven't seen that one. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8251.060000000001s)]
*  Fucking cool. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8251.900000000001s)]
*  Looks like a UFO. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8252.740000000002s)]
*  Looks like a UFO that flies underwater. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8253.580000000002s)]
*  It goes underwater. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8256.140000000001s)]
*  It's not, I don't think it goes above the water. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8257.5s)]
*  I think it only goes underwater, [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8259.820000000002s)]
*  but it looks like a spaceship. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8261.18s)]
*  Yeah, but with the rate of acceleration [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8263.18s)]
*  and the ability to change direction, [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8266.86s)]
*  those are things that are in the reality, [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8270.02s)]
*  in the real world, the physics behind it, [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8273.18s)]
*  as you said, everyone, if it went in that rate of ascent [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8276.300000000001s)]
*  or descent and movement, it would kill everybody inside. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8279.980000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8284.300000000001s)]
*  Momentum. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8285.140000000001s)]
*  But then the question is, what is it doing? [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8286.220000000001s)]
*  Is it actually experiencing G-force at all? [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8288.54s)]
*  Because if it's some sort of a gravity- [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8291.66s)]
*  Oh, zero. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8293.140000000001s)]
*  It's a gravity-based device, [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8293.98s)]
*  it might be experiencing no G-force, [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8294.82s)]
*  and it might be just pushing space out of the way [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8296.539999999999s)]
*  as it moves forward. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8299.9s)]
*  We don't understand, that's like- [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8301.14s)]
*  Do we have that technology? [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8303.46s)]
*  It's a good question. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8304.859999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8305.699999999999s)]
*  It's a good question. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8306.52s)]
*  If we have that technology, then it explains it all, [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8307.359999999999s)]
*  but the question is, as long as we don't acknowledge [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8309.1s)]
*  the fact that we're at that level of technology, [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8312.58s)]
*  then you have to account for where's it coming from. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8315.18s)]
*  Right. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8317.699999999999s)]
*  There's definitely a lot of questions. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8318.539999999999s)]
*  I definitely don't claim to have any answers. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8319.9s)]
*  What is this one? [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8322.02s)]
*  The manta ray thing. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8324.26s)]
*  Oh yeah, look at this sucker. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8325.42s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8327.1s)]
*  This is the one that goes- [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8327.94s)]
*  This is a drone that we developed. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8328.76s)]
*  It's like a manta ray drone. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8330.78s)]
*  It's really cool looking. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8332.34s)]
*  It's the mini sub. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8333.18s)]
*  Well, it's not so mini. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8334.960000000001s)]
*  It's pretty big. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8336.02s)]
*  But look at it. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8337.5s)]
*  It looks like a fucking UFO that goes under the water. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8338.34s)]
*  And it flies through the water. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8341.6s)]
*  And also, what are we looking for? [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8342.58s)]
*  Are we looking for foreign subs, [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8346.140000000001s)]
*  or are we looking for aliens? [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8347.94s)]
*  Both. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8350.140000000001s)]
*  I wonder. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8351.160000000002s)]
*  I wonder. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8352.26s)]
*  Imagine if they knew some stuff was under the ocean [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8353.62s)]
*  and they don't want to tell anybody [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8356.9s)]
*  because they don't want to freak people out. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8357.9s)]
*  Duh. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8360.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8361.34s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8363.0s)]
*  I've seen articles where it talks about cities, [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8363.84s)]
*  communities underneath the ocean in the San Andres, [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8366.26s)]
*  not San Andres Fault. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8369.1s)]
*  What is that fault line called? [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8370.1s)]
*  Not the fault, the- [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8372.140000000001s)]
*  Outside of California? [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8374.7s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8375.66s)]

*  Mariana Trench? [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8377.42s)]
*  The Mariana Trench. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8378.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8379.1s)]

*  and Mariana Trench and UFOs and abductions and so forth. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8464.26s)]
*  Fun stuff. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8469.42s)]
*  It reminds me of 438 where we were talking about [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8471.1s)]
*  every fucking day. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8474.14s)]
*  I mean, you blew me out of the water with that. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8474.98s)]
*  I'll tell you the truth. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8477.26s)]
*  We were there for three and a half hours on the first one. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8478.66s)]
*  And when I left the studio, [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8481.26s)]
*  because I thought it was in Woodland Hills, [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8483.1s)]
*  I thought it was only supposed to be like 30 minutes or so. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8485.380000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8488.06s)]
*  Yeah, but I left and I sat in my car for an hour [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8488.9s)]
*  to recuperate from that first visit with you. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8492.98s)]
*  It was just way beyond. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8498.06s)]
*  Yeah, if there really are things that are monitoring us [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8501.26s)]
*  and checking us out, it makes sense. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8504.78s)]
*  If life exists and it's more advanced than us [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8507.1s)]

*  or it's on another planet, [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8511.74s)]

*  Yeah, they wanna see how fucked up we are [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8515.86s)]
*  in terms of nuclear weapons. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8518.18s)]
*  Sure, yeah. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8519.78s)]
*  And if we're on a path, a predictable path of evolution [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8521.7s)]
*  that almost all intelligent life goes on, [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8525.58s)]
*  there's probably gonna be pitfalls [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8528.42s)]

*  chimpanzees start developing weapons and buildings [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8577.699999999999s)]

*  Interesting, interesting. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8631.3s)]
*  Well, it is interesting because what's different [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8633.26s)]
*  between us and any other people that have ever lived [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8635.98s)]
*  is that we've figured out a way to optimize your health [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8639.46s)]
*  in a very substantial way. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8642.46s)]
*  In the past, someone who was my age, I'm 57, [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8644.699999999999s)]
*  someone who was my age, your body's probably broken. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8647.34s)]
*  Your body is probably beaten down. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8651.06s)]
*  Your hormones are dead. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8653.460000000001s)]
*  You're probably real tired all the time. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8655.18s)]
*  And I'm not. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8657.62s)]
*  And because of vitamins and hormones [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8659.14s)]
*  and all the different things that I do [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8661.18s)]
*  to keep my body healthy and exercise, [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8662.66s)]
*  and we're living in a different time. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8664.66s)]
*  And because of that, you stay vital. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8667.1s)]
*  You have vitality much longer than anyone ever did before. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8669.66s)]
*  So you can explore things and you have more curiosity [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8674.02s)]
*  and energy for thought more than anybody ever has before. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8677.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8682.58s)]

*  No. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8700.82s)]

*  Supplements are very important. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8709.22s)]
*  Hormones are key. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8710.9s)]
*  Exercise. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8713.06s)]
*  Exercise is important because of, as I said, [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8714.06s)]
*  about the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8716.62s)]
*  you can increase it to improve brain. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8718.78s)]
*  This guy out of USC, [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8721.7s)]
*  Caleb Finch, who talked about, [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8723.9s)]
*  he believed that the reason for why we age and we die [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8729.22s)]
*  is because we lose our hormones in our brain. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8732.42s)]
*  And therefore, extremely important. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8735.619999999999s)]

*  That's what you need, more of that. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8741.94s)]
*  No, I need to clear the throat. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8743.3s)]
*  Look at that, I got my voice back. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8745.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8747.1s)]

*  I'm 72 years of age. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8751.58s)]
*  And I think the reason why I'm at 72 [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8753.06s)]
*  with the level of clarity and functionality, [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8755.3s)]
*  aside from my back, is the fact that I've always, [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8760.06s)]
*  30 years I've been in hormone replacement, [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8763.02s)]
*  nutraceuticals, getting in good vitamins, so forth, [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8765.06s)]
*  because our body loses it over the course of time. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8768.9s)]
*  And you need to keep replacing it. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8771.699999999999s)]
*  And the people who are listening to this [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8773.06s)]
*  have to, might understand that you need supplement. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8775.1s)]
*  You need to be proactive on your quality of health. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8779.539999999999s)]
*  Otherwise you start losing it. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8782.22s)]
*  And exercise, not just for that, [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8783.5s)]
*  but also just to maintain your physical presence, [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=8784.859999999999s)]

*  I was trying to get a Porsche Design Huawei phone. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9054.880000000001s)]
*  They were working with, [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9058.24s)]
*  Porsche Design makes a bunch of things. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9060.0s)]
*  They make like watches and sunglasses. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9061.44s)]
*  They don't just make cars. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9064.28s)]
*  Like Porsche Design is like a separate entity of Porsche. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9065.28s)]
*  And Porsche Design worked with Huawei [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9068.2s)]
*  to make like the ultimate cell phone. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9070.12s)]
*  And I was ready to buy it because I'm a dork. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9072.24s)]
*  I'm really into technology. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9075.119999999999s)]
*  And I was like, oh, that thing's crazy. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9075.96s)]
*  Let me get it. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9077.68s)]
*  And I think I had a 100 megapixel camera on the phone. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9078.52s)]
*  And this was a while ago. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9082.039999999999s)]
*  And a 5,000 milliamp battery, which was also crazy. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9083.199999999999s)]
*  But then they banned Huawei products in America. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9087.32s)]
*  So you can't get that trifold. [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9090.48s)]
*  Back door right to the CCP. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9091.96s)]
*  Yeah, allegedly, but isn't TikTok too? [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9093.88s)]
*  Like isn't all these things? [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9096.52s)]
*  There's a lot of back doors. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9098.24s)]
*  A lot of data getting scooped up. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9099.64s)]
*  Yeah, my cybersecurity people keep on telling me [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9101.16s)]
*  don't use Zoom because it back doors into the CCP. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9103.44s)]
*  Oh boy. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9109.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9110.16s)]
*  That's great. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9110.98s)]
*  So I haven't used it. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9111.82s)]
*  So I use Microsoft. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9112.66s)]
*  What the fuck can you use? [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9113.48s)]
*  I don't trust anybody anymore. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9115.64s)]
*  No, I'm scared. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9116.84s)]
*  I'm there with you. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9117.68s)]
*  Scared of all of it. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9118.72s)]
*  But I think it's all inevitable. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9120.24s)]
*  And I think if you look at what's going on, [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9121.88s)]
*  like in terms of like what's the direction [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9126.279999999999s)]
*  that technological progress moves us into. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9129.32s)]
*  Well, it's a direction seems of more and more connectivity, [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9131.36s)]
*  which means less and less privacy. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9134.32s)]
*  So we're gonna have to work that out [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9136.52s)]
*  because when quantum computers can crack all encoding, [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9138.08s)]
*  it's like any encryption that exists, [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9142.36s)]
*  quantum computing is gonna crack all that. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9144.92s)]
*  So you're not gonna have real encryption anymore. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9146.6s)]
*  So like what happens with Bitcoin and digital currency? [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9148.32s)]
*  What happens with all that stuff? [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9151.480000000001s)]
*  What happens with your bank account? [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9152.480000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9153.84s)]
*  We're in weird times. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9155.68s)]
*  Yeah, one of the things that scared me was in the WiFi, [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9156.960000000001s)]
*  they now can go back and using AI, [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9160.88s)]
*  use the transmitted wave form to see who's in a room. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9163.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9170.359999999999s)]
*  You saw that. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9171.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, accurate. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9172.039999999999s)]
*  The 3D representations of the people moving around. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9172.88s)]
*  So I turned off all my WiFi extenders. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9175.64s)]
*  It's all so crazy. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9178.599999999999s)]
*  It's just like we're living in an ultra surveilled world. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9179.439999999999s)]
*  And I think the good news is that the new government [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9182.92s)]
*  is emphasizing privacy and freedom of speech. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9186.839999999998s)]
*  And the other government was emphasizing cracking down [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9189.72s)]
*  on what they called misinformation and disinformation [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9192.96s)]
*  and more control of what you say and do and where you go. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9195.519999999999s)]
*  And the way to get more control is more invasive technology. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9198.72s)]
*  And that's what scares the shit out of me. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9201.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9202.56s)]
*  Is people. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9203.56s)]
*  It's not necessarily the technology. [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9204.8s)]
*  It's people taking advantage of the technology [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9206.4s)]
*  in order to have more control of the population, [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9208.88s)]
*  which makes their job easier. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9211.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's the reason why I only use my cell phone [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9213.599999999999s)]
*  when I travel. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9217.48s)]
*  Otherwise I don't use it. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9219.08s)]
*  People call me and say, where are you? [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9220.0s)]
*  So I use my cell phone. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9222.08s)]
*  Good for you. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9223.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's off all the time. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9223.92s)]
*  My friend Adam Curry, he's super paranoid. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9225.12s)]
*  Maybe not. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9229.64s)]
*  Maybe not paranoid. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9230.64s)]
*  Maybe super aware of digital surveillance and all that stuff. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9231.68s)]
*  So he has a de-Googled phone. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9235.12s)]
*  He has a phone that doesn't have Google on it. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9237.36s)]
*  And it's, what are those, [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9239.84s)]
*  what's that operating system that they use for that stuff? [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9242.0s)]
*  Do you remember, Jamie? [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9244.6s)]
*  Doesn't your friend Musk have a phone that's coming up? [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9246.08s)]
*  No, I just asked him the other day. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9249.359999999999s)]
*  We were talking the other day at the inauguration. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9251.519999999999s)]
*  I was saying, dude, every other day, [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9254.16s)]
*  I get an article about a Tesla phone. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9256.279999999999s)]
*  He was laughing. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9258.0s)]
*  He goes, I hope we don't have to make a phone. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9258.84s)]
*  That's what he said. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9260.8s)]
*  I hope we don't have to make a phone. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9261.64s)]
*  It's very difficult to make a phone. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9262.48s)]
*  But whoever's promoting it. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9263.599999999999s)]
*  That's it, Graphene OS. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9265.08s)]
*  So Graphene is de-Googled phone. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9266.519999999999s)]
*  So they take these pixels and they de-Google them [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9269.72s)]
*  and they put this Graphene OS, [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9273.039999999999s)]
*  which is a completely different operating system. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9275.480000000001s)]
*  And then you have another phone called the unplugged phone [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9279.84s)]
*  that... [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9283.24s)]
*  Pixel 7. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9284.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9284.92s)]
*  That's it. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9286.08s)]
*  And so they use these things [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9286.92s)]
*  and they work just like a regular phone. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9288.32s)]
*  And you can get them where they don't have 5G [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9290.720000000001s)]
*  because some people think 5G is bad for you. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9292.4s)]
*  No, I still work off of 3 and 4 [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9293.960000000001s)]
*  and I don't update the software [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9296.0s)]
*  because updating the software gives them more access to you. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9297.76s)]
*  Dun, dun, dun. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9301.800000000001s)]
*  I gotta go again. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9304.0s)]
*  Well, let's just wrap it up. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9306.199999999999s)]
*  We're at four o'clock. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9307.039999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9307.88s)]
*  Mark Gordon, I love you to death. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9308.72s)]

*  Thank you for all your research and all the work you do [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9313.4s)]
*  and spreading information and knowledge. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9315.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9317.8s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9318.64s)]
*  I appreciate the fact that you've supported me [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9319.48s)]
*  over all these years in the work that we do [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9321.08s)]
*  with our veterans. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9323.039999999999s)]
*  And they've been receiving the benefits [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9324.6s)]
*  of the work that we've done. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9326.76s)]
*  And, you know, stopping the suicide is the goal [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9328.24s)]
*  for the Millennium Health Centers. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9331.52s)]
*  That's it. [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9333.119999999999s)]
*  And tell everybody the website so they can find it. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDckDvN4sA&t=9334.68s)]
