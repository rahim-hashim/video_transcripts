# Joe Rogan Experience #2306 - Deric Poston
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6.0s)]
*  So we were just looking at the song in the security cameras in the fucking gym with his [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10.0s)]
*  stupid haircut. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=17.0s)]
*  He looks so crazy. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=18.0s)]
*  I'm forever in this song. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=19.0s)]
*  Hilarious dude. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=20.0s)]
*  One of the best. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=21.0s)]
*  One of the best. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=22.0s)]
*  He's fantastic and getting better man, all the time. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=23.0s)]
*  He's a guy who's always working. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=26.0s)]
*  Nobody writes more new stuff. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=28.0s)]
*  He writes a lot. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=30.0s)]
*  That guy puts me on my ass. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=31.0s)]
*  We've been best friends for the last 12 years so I've been watching this whole time. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=33.0s)]
*  And since we met, him and Brian Simpson, they put you to work. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=36.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's important because if your friends are slacking, you're like, I can slack off too. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=40.0s)]
*  Yeah, or you feel like, oh man, I'm better than my friends. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=44.0s)]
*  But when your friends are like, every time I see them I'm like, dude, I saw you yesterday. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=46.0s)]
*  You have two new bits? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=50.0s)]
*  And they're good? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=51.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=52.0s)]
*  How the fuck? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=53.0s)]
*  But one of his bits is his fucking hair. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=54.0s)]
*  It's Hinchcliffe's song. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=59.0s)]
*  Hinchcliffe fucking keeps encouraging, like keep it going, keep it going. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=60.0s)]
*  He does encourage it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=62.0s)]
*  And I told you, he's getting mad pussy with the hair. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=64.0s)]
*  Shh, don't say that. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=66.0s)]
*  Oh, he's thinking of fucking up his pussy. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=67.0s)]
*  You're right, you're right. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=69.0s)]
*  I heard you say you're getting mad pussy. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=70.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=75.0s)]
*  I thought we were having a wonderful... [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=76.0s)]
*  There's nothing funnier than when your friends pull you aside to complain about a girl that's [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=79.0s)]
*  like putting the cuffs on them. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=86.0s)]
*  It's the best. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=87.0s)]
*  Why don't you do things? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=88.0s)]
*  Why don't you... [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=89.0s)]
*  I heard the haircut. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=90.0s)]
*  Why don't you cut your hair better so you don't get mad pussy? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=91.0s)]
*  You take comedy serious, you don't take me serious. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=96.0s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=98.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=99.0s)]
*  Look at how smooth he looks though. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=100.0s)]
*  He looks dressed nice. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=103.0s)]
*  He's headlining La Jolla this weekend with you, right? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=104.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, we're doing it next week, next Thursday. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=106.0s)]
*  Oh, next week. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=108.0s)]
*  Next Thursday, yeah, going back. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=109.0s)]
*  And then we're doing the Belly Room too, headlining the Belly Room the next night. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=110.0s)]
*  Nice. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=112.0s)]
*  Fucking La Jolla is one of the best rooms in the world. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=113.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=115.0s)]
*  That La Jolla room is fire. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=116.0s)]
*  If you get it crushing in there, it's a box. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=118.0s)]
*  It's a literal box. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=121.0s)]
*  It's a kill box. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=122.0s)]
*  And he's cheating with his hair. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=123.0s)]
*  He's cheating. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=124.0s)]
*  He's cheating. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=125.0s)]
*  I won't say the jokes, but these hair jokes are just too good. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=126.0s)]
*  Well, they go... [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=129.0s)]
*  People lose their... [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=130.0s)]
*  They lose their mind. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=131.0s)]
*  It's unfortunate because they think he looks way better with his head shaved. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=132.0s)]
*  He's a good looking guy. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=135.0s)]
*  He's a good looking guy. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=136.0s)]
*  And since you got him in the gym, his chest is filled out, his back straighter. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=137.0s)]
*  I love when I come here and you two guys are in the gym and you're by yourselves. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=143.0s)]
*  No one's pushing you. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=147.0s)]
*  I love it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=148.0s)]
*  I love it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=149.0s)]
*  The only thing, because we do every single thing that we did back when we were working [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=150.0s)]
*  out, but other than some days that we look at that cold punch, we're like, Joe, you're [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=153.0s)]
*  a fucking psycho. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=156.0s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here, dude. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=157.0s)]
*  Not getting in cold water for you today. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=159.0s)]
*  I'm down to workout tomorrow if you guys want to do it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=162.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=164.0s)]
*  All right, let's do it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=165.0s)]
*  Hell yeah, we'll get a good old school one in. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=166.0s)]
*  Yeah, we'll get an old school one. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=167.0s)]
*  I'll get in the cold punch. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=168.0s)]
*  If we're all doing it, I need we all to be doing it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=169.0s)]
*  So my friend Sean, who trained Alex Jones, is now training Shane. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=171.0s)]
*  He's going to start training Shane. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=176.0s)]
*  I heard about it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=178.0s)]
*  He puts him through gauntlets. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=179.0s)]
*  I told Shane, don't let him kill you. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=180.0s)]
*  Don't let him kill you. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=182.0s)]
*  It makes you back him off a little at the beginning. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=183.0s)]
*  These fucking psychopaths. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=186.0s)]
*  I remember when Asan did it with him the first time, Sean, he got him to do it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=188.0s)]
*  I was out of town with Shultz and Asan called me and goes, bro, I threw up twice. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=191.0s)]
*  At the end, he goes, no, at the beginning. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=195.0s)]
*  I was like, bro, get the fuck out of here. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=197.0s)]
*  You got to build up to that kind of stuff. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=199.0s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=201.0s)]
*  Sean's in great shape. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=202.0s)]
*  If you're used to coaching Navy Seals and you're like, come on, pussy, we got to go. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=203.0s)]
*  Carry the fucking log. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=210.0s)]
*  Who's going to carry the boats? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=212.0s)]
*  That's one thing. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=213.0s)]
*  But when you're a guy like Shane and you're on a workout on again, off again, on again, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=214.0s)]
*  off again, you can't hurt the guy. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=219.0s)]
*  You got to start slow. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=222.0s)]
*  When we started working out, what we do is start slow. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=224.0s)]
*  Real slow. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=227.0s)]
*  You were teaching us how to use the kettlebells, let alone going super hard at it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=228.0s)]
*  Whereas now, me and Asan have upped our weight because now we've done it so many. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=231.0s)]
*  The rhythm of kettlebells. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=235.0s)]
*  It's going to be fun. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=236.0s)]
*  Oh, dude, I'm excited for the world. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=237.0s)]
*  I was going to tell you this about Asan's hair. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=238.0s)]
*  That's back to it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=243.0s)]
*  We're seeing him on the security camera going, what the fuck are you doing? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=244.0s)]
*  I was like, he looks like a fucking psycho. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=246.0s)]
*  I can't believe it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=248.0s)]
*  People love it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=249.0s)]
*  They love it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=250.0s)]
*  I'll never forget this. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=251.0s)]
*  One night I'm working the back door of the comedy store. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=252.0s)]
*  This is when Theo Vaughn had just ... He went from a guy we all knew to he's now Theo Vaughn. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=254.0s)]
*  I'm sitting back there and he pulled in and we're just kind of hanging at the back door. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=260.0s)]
*  He goes, Derek, let me tell you something, man. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=263.0s)]
*  He goes, I was getting 2,000 a weekend before this hair. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=268.0s)]
*  Since this mullet, I get about 40K a weekend and walked off. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=271.0s)]
*  I was like, man, what the fuck? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=275.0s)]
*  Wow, what you trying to say? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=276.0s)]
*  I literally was like, I don't know what I'm supposed to do. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=277.0s)]
*  You know what though? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=280.0s)]
*  It's true, but it's not true. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=281.0s)]
*  It's true that when the haircut came, he got more money on the weekend. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=283.0s)]
*  It's also like the haircut freed him to be Theo Vaughn. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=289.0s)]
*  I agree. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=293.0s)]
*  Do you remember when ... I remember very clearly the first time I ever saw Theo. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=294.0s)]
*  He was doing a bit about being ... Not even a bit. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=299.0s)]
*  He was telling a story, a true story about when he was young, his father was really old. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=302.0s)]
*  His father had it when he was like 70. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=309.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=311.0s)]
*  Something crazy. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=312.0s)]
*  He remembers being on acid lying next to his father and realizes his father is just dying. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=313.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=321.0s)]
*  If you've ever been around someone who is like really 100 years old, they feel like there's no life force in them. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=322.0s)]
*  They're almost trapped in their mind. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=329.0s)]
*  He's on acid lying next to him. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=333.0s)]
*  I was like, whoa, this guy is weird. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=334.0s)]
*  What a weird set. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=336.0s)]
*  He was talking about all kinds of other stuff too, but it was really fun, but it was interesting. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=337.0s)]
*  Then I remember seeing him about a year, a year and a half later, and I couldn't fucking breathe. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=343.0s)]
*  I was just crying loud. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=349.0s)]
*  My cousin got bit by a gay guy, so we'll see. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=350.0s)]
*  I was just like, what the fuck are you saying? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=357.0s)]
*  What the fuck are you saying? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=360.0s)]
*  It was the timing and just the material was all over the place this weird way. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=362.0s)]
*  I love a guy like that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=369.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=370.0s)]
*  I agree. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=371.0s)]
*  The mullet might have just been the little touch, but he was already your favorite to watch. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=372.0s)]
*  Sometimes you need something like that to make you feel different. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=376.0s)]
*  Like some dudes, I think, like dressing nice on stage because they feel different. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=380.0s)]
*  Or Bert likes to take his shirt off because he feels different. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=385.0s)]
*  Bert could do the same set with a tuxedo on. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=388.0s)]
*  It would be the same fun. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=391.0s)]
*  Yeah, it would be the same fun. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=393.0s)]
*  It just makes him feel free to let that fucking gut hang out and show everybody he's willing to drink himself to death for you. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=395.0s)]
*  Like he's a fucking gladiator, dude. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=405.0s)]
*  But they love it. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=408.0s)]
*  But I do get that feeling of being free on stage and truly, because that does separate yourself too. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=409.0s)]
*  Like, oh, this is how I am. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=414.0s)]
*  Yeah, you got to learn how to do that some way, right? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=416.0s)]
*  And some people it's alcohol and some people it's the way they dress and some people it's weed and some people, you know, they have to run, they have to jog before they do a set. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=419.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=428.0s)]
*  I remember seeing Eleanor, she would do dips. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=429.0s)]
*  You'll catch her in the back of the hall and she's just cranking out dips and then she goes up. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=431.0s)]
*  But then you see when she's up, it's like, oh, that energy had to just, it was just coming out of her. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=435.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's coming out of you. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=439.0s)]
*  Also, you want to get your heart rate up a little bit so your body is like and your mind is like things are flowing really good. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=440.0s)]
*  You don't want to be like sleepy and then go on stage, right? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=447.0s)]
*  That's the worst thing in the world or a full meal. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=449.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=452.0s)]
*  And go on stage. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=453.0s)]
*  You want to be you want to be up a little. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=454.0s)]
*  I heard Bill Burr say something, but he's just one of the greatest ever do it. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=456.0s)]
*  But it always made me go damn, because I always felt that way. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=460.0s)]
*  Like, no, I wouldn't eat before meal, eat before show, wouldn't eat. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=462.0s)]
*  And then I heard him say once he was like, I used to not eat before shows. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=465.0s)]
*  And then I got older and I fucking have a Thanksgiving dinner before a show and go up and talk the whole set about how I had a Thanksgiving dinner and how fucking fat I am and how gross we all are in America. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=468.0s)]
*  And it was just like that freedom of like, wow, he really doesn't give a fuck. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=476.0s)]
*  This guy, he well, Bill is also amazing at being Bill. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=480.0s)]
*  Like, you know, like he has he has his opinions, his what he thinks is stupid about something. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=486.0s)]
*  And he's just like locked in. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=493.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know what I mean? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=496.0s)]
*  Like, there's no like some comics like you'll see one of their hours and it's kind of like one kind of energy. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=497.0s)]
*  And then the other hour, it's like kind of a different kind of and it would be Bill Burr. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=504.0s)]
*  It's Bill Burr. I'm Bill Burr. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=508.0s)]
*  It's Bill Burr. He knows how to be Bill Burr. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=509.0s)]
*  He's professionally Bill Burr. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=511.0s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=513.0s)]
*  A lot of people couldn't even do his material. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=515.0s)]
*  It would just like wouldn't work. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=517.0s)]
*  No, and it would sound like the world. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=519.0s)]
*  But that's just the magic of becoming, you know, you. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=523.0s)]
*  Right. Like, there's a few like a tell is the absolute best at it. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=527.0s)]
*  A tell has a timing and a presence and then the material, the way it's written, like a lot of it on paper, you'd be like, what is this? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=531.0s)]
*  I don't understand how this would be funny. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=540.0s)]
*  But you see him do it in real life. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=542.0s)]
*  You're like, oh, my God. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=544.0s)]
*  You're just crying. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=546.0s)]
*  Yeah. And when the crowd is more ruckus, he he's better. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=547.0s)]
*  He's in on the corniness of some of the stuff, too, which makes it even more fun. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=550.0s)]
*  It's like there's many layers to it. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=554.0s)]
*  And, you know, some of it is just like just brilliant observations on things. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=557.0s)]
*  Some of them is completely ridiculous. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=561.0s)]
*  You know, it's just all but it's woven into David Tell and pull out a fucking recorder. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=564.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=570.0s)]
*  Just play the flute. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=571.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=573.0s)]
*  But we saw him live. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=574.0s)]
*  I was so fucking impressed at the mothership. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=575.0s)]
*  I was so impressed. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=578.0s)]
*  I was like, that is so good. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=579.0s)]
*  You know, is another one like that. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=580.0s)]
*  Colin Quinn, you know, when he was here, bro, you see him live. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=582.0s)]
*  You're like, wow, that was so good. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=585.0s)]
*  Just so fun. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=588.0s)]
*  You forget how good he is. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=590.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then you're learning shit. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=591.0s)]
*  I didn't know this. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=593.0s)]
*  Yeah. He's like a history wizard. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=594.0s)]
*  I remember we did tough crowd once and Colin used to do stand up to the crowd before the show would start, before we'd sit down and do tough crowd. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=596.0s)]
*  He was doing the warm up for his own show. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=605.0s)]
*  He was doing the warm up for his own show. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=607.0s)]
*  This one time. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=608.0s)]
*  I don't know if he did it all the time, but he was murdering, murdering. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=609.0s)]
*  And I was watching this. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=613.0s)]
*  I was like, people don't know how good he is. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=614.0s)]
*  Like, this is crazy because like there's some guys that warm up for their show and it's like a monologue. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=617.0s)]
*  They're doing a few jokes. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=623.0s)]
*  It's like, it's OK. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=624.0s)]
*  It's OK. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=625.0s)]
*  But I'm not in it. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=626.0s)]
*  I'm not really feeling it with him. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=627.0s)]
*  It was like I was at a club. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=628.0s)]
*  I was like dying laughing like I was at a comedy club. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=630.0s)]
*  I was like, people don't know. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=632.0s)]
*  This is like there's a few of these guys just never got good at promoting, you know, and they're really good. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=634.0s)]
*  Yeah. And the interesting thing is the really good ones are not bitter, that they're not as famous as they deserve to be. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=641.0s)]
*  Like I tell is like the least bitter guy alive. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=648.0s)]
*  He's so cool. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=650.0s)]
*  Not even remotely bitter. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=651.0s)]
*  Always friendly. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=652.0s)]
*  Open mic or all day. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=653.0s)]
*  Sweet, peaceful. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=655.0s)]
*  Like he's as present as you can get. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=656.0s)]
*  And he's infinitely less famous than he should be. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=659.0s)]
*  He should be selling out arenas all over the world. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=664.0s)]
*  He's that good. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=667.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=668.0s)]
*  He's so good, dude. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=669.0s)]
*  He might be the best comic alive. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=670.0s)]
*  There's like a few in my mind that are like in the running for that. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=672.0s)]
*  Like who is the best? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=676.0s)]
*  I guess there's no one best. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=677.0s)]
*  It's it's it's you know, she always have to consider Chappelle. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=679.0s)]
*  He's the goat of our generation. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=682.0s)]
*  He's the most prolific. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=685.0s)]
*  He has social impact. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=686.0s)]
*  He's hilarious and silly. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=688.0s)]
*  And he's a sweetheart of a person, too. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=690.0s)]
*  So you have to think that. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=692.0s)]
*  But then I go with like sheer RPMs. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=693.0s)]
*  I got to go with Joey. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=696.0s)]
*  Sheer RPMs. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=697.0s)]
*  We just like how many nights were we in the back of the comedy store? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=698.0s)]
*  We couldn't we couldn't even couldn't even talk. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=702.0s)]
*  You couldn't breathe. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=705.0s)]
*  You're not even laughing. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=706.0s)]
*  You're just reason. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=707.0s)]
*  Everybody's just reason. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=708.0s)]
*  He'll make it wheezing noises and slapping things. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=709.0s)]
*  Man, I remember back that era seeing him and how people feel about him now. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=712.0s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=718.0s)]
*  But at that time, man, when Crystal Leah was on stage in that main room some nights, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=719.0s)]
*  it was mind blowing. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=725.0s)]
*  The RPMs. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=726.0s)]
*  Just the amount of laughter and how fast would be like, what the fuck? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=727.0s)]
*  Yeah, he could kill. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=732.0s)]
*  There's some there's a magic to that thing. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=733.0s)]
*  I think that's hypnosis. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=736.0s)]
*  I've always thought that I've been like for a long time, at least. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=737.0s)]
*  I'm like, what is happening to me when someone's on stage and they're killing, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=740.0s)]
*  you know, like when Shane when Shane's on fire, what is happening to me? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=744.0s)]
*  I think I'm like locked in with their mind. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=748.0s)]
*  I don't think it's as simple as I'm watching a show or something like that, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=752.0s)]
*  because I love like watching a funny movie, you know, Tropic Thunder, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=756.0s)]
*  something like that. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=760.0s)]
*  I love laughing, watching funny movie, but I don't feel the same way I feel when [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=761.0s)]
*  a guy is in front of me on stage doing stand up. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=765.0s)]
*  And I think as great as specials are, they're never they're like 60 to 70 percent [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=768.0s)]
*  of being there live. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=775.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=777.0s)]
*  Always. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=778.0s)]
*  I think there's something about being there live that's like it's hypnosis. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=779.0s)]
*  There's something going on where that that person's making me think the way they [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=784.0s)]
*  think. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=788.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=789.0s)]
*  When someone brings you into their world and like you said, you're just living in [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=790.0s)]
*  it and you're not even thinking about you're just like I'm living in this guy's [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=792.0s)]
*  exactly essence right now. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=795.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=796.0s)]
*  You're living in this person's imagination and this person's work, right? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=797.0s)]
*  Because they like they set this set up. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=801.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=804.0s)]
*  And they danced it around their head and they wrote it down on paper. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=805.0s)]
*  That's the other interesting thing about what we do is like no one has there's no [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=807.0s)]
*  like one way to do it. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=811.0s)]
*  I always say my way to do it. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=812.0s)]
*  But you know, I don't think Bill writes shit down. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=813.0s)]
*  I think he keeps it all in his head. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=816.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=818.0s)]
*  Dave mostly keeps it all in his head to Schultz does that too. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=819.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=822.0s)]
*  That's the Jay-Z thing too. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=823.0s)]
*  Jay-Z kept it all in his little way. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=825.0s)]
*  They didn't. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=827.0s)]
*  They just say they're releasing. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=828.0s)]
*  It's not like they're releasing one album. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=829.0s)]
*  But who's the best writer? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=831.0s)]
*  Nas Nas wrote everything down. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=832.0s)]
*  You can't write rewind in your head. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=835.0s)]
*  No, you can't. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=838.0s)]
*  No, it's a story backwards. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=839.0s)]
*  It's a story backwards. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=841.0s)]
*  It's another level. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=842.0s)]
*  That's another level. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=843.0s)]
*  That's like him pulling his dick out and just like slapping that shit on the table. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=844.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=850.0s)]
*  That's all we want to say like writing like I challenge anybody in the world who's got [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=851.0s)]
*  a better written song than rewind from Nas. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=856.0s)]
*  That's a great take. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=859.0s)]
*  I would agree with that. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=860.0s)]
*  It's perfectly fluent backwards. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=861.0s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=862.0s)]
*  It's a language almost. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=863.0s)]
*  Perfectly fluent backwards. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=864.0s)]
*  It's magic. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=865.0s)]
*  It's like a magic song. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=866.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=868.0s)]
*  And while you're watching it, you're appreciating the fact that he pulled it off. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=869.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=874.0s)]
*  You know, like while you're listening, you're appreciating the fact that he pulled off this [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=875.0s)]
*  song backwards. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=879.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's impressive to watch the different ways people do it. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=880.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm biased because I tour with him. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=882.0s)]
*  But man, when I'm out with fucking Schultz, dude, because people just see him come up [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=884.0s)]
*  with that 10 minutes up top. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=889.0s)]
*  You know, like we'll go to Abu Dhabi. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=890.0s)]
*  You can just see it, right? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=892.0s)]
*  But man, you know, people, I get to see how he gets there. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=893.0s)]
*  And it's he gets to town and no matter where we are, and all he does is he just talks to [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=897.0s)]
*  people and he doesn't say anything. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=902.0s)]
*  He just he gets a random person who's lived in wherever we're at for a long time. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=904.0s)]
*  And he just lets them and you can just and you just see him kind of like in his eyes will [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=907.0s)]
*  light up when somebody says a certain thing. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=911.0s)]
*  His eyes will light up and he's like, oh, OK. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=912.0s)]
*  Oh, that's going on. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=914.0s)]
*  Oh, and what do they think of this? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=915.0s)]
*  So what are the time? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=917.0s)]
*  And he'll ask a couple of questions. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=918.0s)]
*  He'll do it. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=919.0s)]
*  And I'm not talking about 30 minutes, Joe. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=920.0s)]
*  He'll talk to somebody for three, four hours before the show and just soak in all the culture [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=921.0s)]
*  and all the information. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=925.0s)]
*  And then you see him go on stage and it's a full flush 10 minute chunk about a place. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=926.0s)]
*  He's a special talent. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=932.0s)]
*  That's he's a special talent. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=933.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've never seen anything like that. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=934.0s)]
*  He's very special. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=936.0s)]
*  And, you know, and it's also like you got to realize he's doing these jokes in front [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=937.0s)]
*  of 16000 people for the first time. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=941.0s)]
*  He's got a new joke and he's busting it out in front of 16000 people about their area. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=943.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=949.0s)]
*  What shit he did in Hawaii about the chickens being so confident. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=950.0s)]
*  I was the black guy. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=953.0s)]
*  We got out the van and saw the chickens run up to me. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=958.0s)]
*  He's like, these chickens are too confident, dog. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=961.0s)]
*  They don't know Derek. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=963.0s)]
*  And I would die. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=965.0s)]
*  And it's a foreign bit later that night. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=966.0s)]
*  And it's like, this guy is incredible. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=968.0s)]
*  And that's that's another example. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=970.0s)]
*  Like, what is he doing? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=971.0s)]
*  How is he doing that to that crowd with those great jokes? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=972.0s)]
*  Like, he's like he's locking those people in or you letting him think for you. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=974.0s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=978.0s)]
*  Think for me. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=979.0s)]
*  Let me have a good time and think for me. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=980.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=982.0s)]
*  And not only that, but you're talking about my own personal experience in Hawaii. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=983.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=985.0s)]
*  And now you're going into your set. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=986.0s)]
*  You have me. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=988.0s)]
*  You have me completely wrapped around. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=989.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're a pro. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=990.0s)]
*  It was insane. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=991.0s)]
*  He's he keeps getting better. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=992.0s)]
*  It's I mean, he was good when I first saw him a few years back. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=994.0s)]
*  But man, he just keeps getting better. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=997.0s)]
*  Well, like you said earlier, how to see people do different hours. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=999.0s)]
*  You know what? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1002.0s)]
*  It's different in life. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1003.0s)]
*  People forget he was like the first guy to really capitalize on the pandemic with his [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1004.0s)]
*  videos, where he essentially created a completely new kind of stand up. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1010.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1015.0s)]
*  So they'd stand up without the pauses that you would require if an audience was laughing. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1016.0s)]
*  So he's it's more rapid paced. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1022.0s)]
*  Like he thought this through, dude. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1025.0s)]
*  This is like a genius thing. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1027.0s)]
*  Those things turn your phone sideways. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1028.0s)]
*  So that's what you used to have to do back in the day, kids. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1030.0s)]
*  Five years ago. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1033.0s)]
*  All you fucking 15 year olds when you were 10, you didn't know about this. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1034.0s)]
*  But you when you turn your phone sideways and then it would be play out in wide format. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1037.0s)]
*  And he would kind of do stand up with images and with punch lines. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1042.0s)]
*  And it was fucking great. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1047.0s)]
*  But it was a way faster pace than he does stand up on stage. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1048.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was like the punch lines. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1052.0s)]
*  And then you listen to that. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1054.0s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, my God, he figured it out. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1056.0s)]
*  He figured out how to make like really compelling stand up for someone who's not there. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1058.0s)]
*  Well, it's like it's like a late night monologue from one of those late night hosts, but like a real motherfucker doing it and really giving their actual opinion. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1062.0s)]
*  Exactly. Exactly. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1069.0s)]

*  But the way he said it, I've never seen someone say I stole a joke. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1317.0s)]
*  And he was like, man, I said I saw it. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1319.0s)]
*  And then I realized I stole Joe's joke. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1322.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I got to stop watching motherfuckers. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1323.0s)]

*  Sometimes you think you came up with it, but somebody else did and you heard it. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1332.0s)]
*  And you forgot that can definitely especially if it's a subject that you never cover and time has passed. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1337.0s)]
*  And then the subject comes up like something comes up and you like it almost like David tells the best at that. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1343.0s)]
*  He'll call you up because you have to check sometimes like, hey, have you heard this? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1349.0s)]
*  You know, like you have like he's the best at that. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1354.0s)]

*  But it's not it's not a photographic representation of reality. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1379.0s)]
*  And that's a problem. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1385.0s)]
*  And you guys have been doing stand up 20 years. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1386.0s)]

*  I always said that Damon may he might be one of the most underappreciated comics ever because like when he was in his prime, you got to realize he was like, you know, if you're looking at today, he was like Chappelle. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1397.0s)]

*  You can't do that. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1430.0s)]

*  I don't know. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1441.0s)]
*  What other families are there that are like big showbiz? [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1442.0s)]
*  Not in comedy. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1444.0s)]
*  What other family? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1445.0s)]
*  Am I missing something? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1446.0s)]
*  Am I forgetting somebody? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1447.0s)]
*  I mean, I know in Living Color was like them and then the Sklar brothers. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1448.0s)]
*  It's no other family. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1451.0s)]
*  There's nobody in the hunt. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1454.0s)]
*  In Living Color. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1457.0s)]
*  So big, Joe, did you notice that the reason we have the Super Bowl halftime show is because [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1458.0s)]
*  of In Living Color? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1463.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, I didn't know that. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1464.0s)]
*  Like I'm in a big family. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1465.0s)]
*  I'm not in a big family. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1466.0s)]
*  Like, I didn't know that. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1467.0s)]
*  I'm not in a big family. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1468.0s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1469.0s)]
*  I mean, I didn't know that. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1470.0s)]
*  Like, I didn't know that. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1471.0s)]
*  is because of In Living Color. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1472.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1474.12s)]
*  So In Living Color, that's true. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1475.32s)]
*  So before Michael Jackson did, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1477.08s)]
*  the year they brought Michael Jackson [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1478.72s)]
*  was because the year before that, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1479.72s)]
*  In Living Color aired during the Super Bowl. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1481.68s)]
*  And they lost so many viewers. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1484.72s)]
*  They lost like a, not half, a big number [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1486.88s)]
*  where they were like, we can't let people leave [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1489.68s)]
*  during the halftime show, because this show is too big. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1492.24s)]
*  What year was that? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1494.08s)]
*  I wanna say Michael Jackson was 95, maybe 96. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1495.08s)]
*  It had to be earlier than that. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1498.72s)]
*  Maybe 94? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1500.36s)]
*  It had to be earlier than that [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1501.28s)]
*  because I remember watching it on TV at a pool hall. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1502.28s)]
*  93. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1506.48s)]
*  93. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1507.32s)]
*  93. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1508.16s)]
*  So I was just moving to New York, to LA from New York then. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1509.0s)]
*  So I was in New York at a pool hall watching it. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1513.64s)]
*  And I remember watching Fire Marshal Bill [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1515.68s)]
*  and I'll be like, how can you do this? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1518.2s)]
*  How is this allowed? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1521.16s)]
*  Like, this show's crazy. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1522.44s)]
*  You have to realize for 93, there was nothing. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1525.2s)]
*  Like if you think about the internet today [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1527.72s)]
*  and all the crazy videos that people put together [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1529.56s)]
*  and the years of mad TV and, you know. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1531.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1535.1599999999999s)]
*  But back then, back then, man, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1536.0s)]
*  there was nothing like this show. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1538.44s)]
*  This show was crazy. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1540.0s)]
*  That is Paul, oh my God, that is Paulie right in the corner. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1541.9199999999998s)]
*  Oh, look at Paulie. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1544.84s)]
*  The weave. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1546.3999999999999s)]
*  Look at him, he's moving the head like a pigeon, bro. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1547.48s)]
*  He's here now too. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1551.28s)]
*  Yeah, I know that. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1552.28s)]
*  When they're fun hanging out with Paulie, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1553.12s)]
*  it's like being at the store, man. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1554.12s)]
*  It's the best. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1556.32s)]
*  But this is unreal. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1557.24s)]
*  This show was great. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1560.3200000000002s)]
*  But Damon, if you want to watch something, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1561.16s)]
*  watch, I think it's The Last Stand. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1563.0800000000002s)]
*  I think that was one of his, I think that's the name of it. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1566.68s)]
*  Something like, I think it's The Last Stand. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1570.0s)]
*  But it's fucking phenomenal. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1571.44s)]
*  And it's so good, but it's also like so good [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1573.44s)]
*  if you go back to that time. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1576.2s)]
*  Because comedy, like everything else, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1578.48s)]
*  has evolved with all the scrutiny on it [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1580.4s)]
*  and all the different high level people that are doing it. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1582.68s)]
*  Like there's the comedy right now, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1585.88s)]
*  I think is at like the highest level that I've ever seen. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1587.4s)]
*  There's so many really great comedians. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1590.0800000000002s)]
*  I think in the 1980s, like if you go back, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1593.8400000000001s)]
*  you had Kenison, you had Eddie Murphy, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1597.0s)]
*  you had Richard Pryor, you had George Carlin, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1600.16s)]
*  you had a bunch of really good guys, Jerry Seinfeld. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1603.8000000000002s)]
*  But that, many after that, you know, wasn't as thick. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1606.6000000000001s)]
*  As thick with assassins. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1612.16s)]
*  I think like right now, there's so many assassins out there. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1614.6399999999999s)]
*  There's more arena acts out there right now [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1618.28s)]
*  than has ever been in the history of comedy. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1620.9599999999998s)]
*  You gotta realize, arena acts started with Dice Clay. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1623.9199999999998s)]
*  So Dice Clay starts off becoming, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1627.24s)]
*  he becomes an arena act in like 87ish? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1629.3999999999999s)]
*  Late 80s is when arena act comedy started. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1634.32s)]
*  Before that, and nobody was doing it but Dice. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1637.6s)]
*  Dice was the only arena act. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1640.12s)]
*  Yeah, and then arena act number two, Dane Cook. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1643.0s)]
*  And that's how many years later? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1646.2s)]
*  Many, because this is like Dane Cooks becomes [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1648.52s)]
*  an arena act in like the 2000s. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1650.72s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1653.24s)]
*  So then there's Dane Cook. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1654.92s)]
*  Dane Cook starts selling on arena. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1656.48s)]
*  I was like, what is happening? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1657.76s)]
*  What is happening? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1659.52s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, the internet happens [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1661.28s)]
*  and social media happens and a lot of comics. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1665.2s)]
*  We were talking about like Dave Vittal and Colin Quinn. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1669.5600000000002s)]
*  Dave Vittal's one of the best to ever do it. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1673.52s)]
*  And if there's ever a club where he's not sold out [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1676.1200000000001s)]
*  the moment it's on stage, it's a travesty. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1679.48s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1681.8000000000002s)]
*  Doesn't make sense. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1683.0s)]
*  But they didn't connect to the internet the same way. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1683.8400000000001s)]
*  And because the notoriety is not commensurate to the talent, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1687.96s)]
*  whereas like with Schultz, the notoriety [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1693.88s)]
*  and the talent are perfectly balanced. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1696.44s)]
*  It's the same level. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1700.04s)]
*  So everybody knows how good he is [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1701.48s)]
*  and everybody knows who he is. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1703.76s)]
*  It's like, it's locked in where it's like, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1705.64s)]
*  Dave Vittal is this. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1707.24s)]
*  But like the notoriety is like us talking about him only. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1710.16s)]
*  Word of mouth only. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1713.72s)]
*  His social media is hot garbage. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1715.2s)]
*  He's got a flip phone. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1717.44s)]
*  He's got a flip phone. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1718.64s)]
*  And he texts you with the doot doot doot doot. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1719.48s)]
*  He's got to press four times to get an R [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1722.16s)]
*  or whatever the fuck it is. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1724.16s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1726.0s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1727.68s)]
*  He does it like that. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1728.56s)]
*  It's crazy he does it like that. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1729.44s)]
*  Like why do you do it like that? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1730.76s)]
*  Because he could be on the internet more. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1732.48s)]
*  I mean, I remember when he had that show Insomniac. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1733.96s)]
*  That's when I first saw him. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1735.76s)]
*  Let me throw this at you [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1737.12s)]
*  because I've been trying to stay off social media [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1738.12s)]
*  more and more every day. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1740.0s)]
*  Like a little less every day. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1741.92s)]
*  And the more I do it, the better I feel. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1743.6s)]
*  It's like not being poisoned. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1746.8s)]
*  It really is. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1749.44s)]
*  It's like getting away from a poison [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1750.52s)]
*  that you didn't know was a poison. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1752.72s)]
*  Like some like forever plastics [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1753.92s)]
*  in your Starbucks cup or something. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1755.92s)]
*  I quit those Starbucks cups and all of a sudden. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1757.9199999999998s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1760.4399999999998s)]
*  It's like something like that. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1761.28s)]
*  I quit drinking tap water [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1762.36s)]
*  and all of a sudden I can think better. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1763.76s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1769.28s)]
*  45,000 tickets in 78. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1770.3999999999999s)]
*  Oh my God, that's right. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1772.12s)]
*  You know. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1773.24s)]
*  I don't know if anybody else before that. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1774.08s)]
*  We always, people forget about him. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1774.9199999999998s)]
*  I forgot about Steve Martin. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1775.76s)]
*  I forgot about Steve Martin for two reasons. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1777.04s)]
*  One, because Steve Martin was a little different. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1778.6s)]
*  He was doing standup, but it was a lot of songs. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1781.12s)]
*  And it was, you know what I mean? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1783.72s)]
*  He was great, by the way. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1785.08s)]
*  Like Let's Get Small is phenomenal. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1786.24s)]
*  But I think he got to a point where comedy became too easy [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1788.36s)]
*  because so he didn't know what was funny anymore [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1793.88s)]
*  because everybody loved him so much. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1796.24s)]
*  And he stopped doing standup, which is really weird. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1797.56s)]
*  Wow. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1800.1200000000001s)]
*  Probably didn't have good friends. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1800.96s)]
*  Yeah, because we had good friends. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1802.24s)]
*  We would have grabbed them like we grabbed Ron White. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1803.48s)]
*  Remember when Ron White was trying to quit? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1805.72s)]
*  Retire. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1806.56s)]
*  Yeah, like what are you talking about? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1807.4s)]
*  I'm not gonna retire. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1808.24s)]
*  Like what the fuck are you talking about? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1809.64s)]
*  Why would you do that? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1811.1200000000001s)]
*  Why would you do that? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1812.2s)]
*  Isn't comedy fun? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1813.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1814.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1814.84s)]
*  You're doing fun things. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1815.68s)]
*  What the fuck is wrong with you? [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1816.76s)]
*  Like I can't believe I have to give them this advice. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1817.76s)]
*  Like you're Ron White. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1820.44s)]
*  How are you thinking about, how much fun are you having [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1821.4s)]
*  when you're killing up there? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1824.48s)]
*  But I think that was the drinking thing too, man. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1825.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, he's sober now. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1827.96s)]
*  Yeah, it was drinking and it was also he needed a tribe. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1828.96s)]
*  You know, and he had the tribe a little bit [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1832.3200000000002s)]
*  when he was in California. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1834.72s)]
*  You know, but he was always on the road a lot, you know, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1836.88s)]
*  and he just decided that being in the center [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1838.96s)]
*  of the country was better. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1841.76s)]
*  So he was like patient zero of the Austin Revolution. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1843.32s)]
*  Like a lot of people think it was me, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1846.68s)]
*  but it was really Ron, because I came here [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1847.8s)]
*  knowing that Ron was here. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1850.72s)]
*  I was like, at the very least, Ron's here. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1851.92s)]
*  You know? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1854.92s)]
*  It's two of us. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1855.76s)]
*  I'm like, I'm not living like this in California. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1856.6s)]
*  You're not doing this to me. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1857.84s)]
*  I know what you're doing. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1858.84s)]
*  I was like, the fucking caged animal in me [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1859.68s)]
*  is like, I'm getting out. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1862.8799999999999s)]
*  This is not, this is gonna go sideways. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1864.0s)]
*  I'm not gonna be a part of this. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1865.8799999999999s)]
*  Fuck you. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1867.16s)]
*  Okay, at least Ron's there. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1868.24s)]
*  I was like, my life is gonna be worse [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1869.44s)]
*  than it ever was before. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1871.52s)]
*  All my friends are gone. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1873.76s)]
*  They're not here. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1874.76s)]
*  I'm in the middle of the country. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1876.16s)]
*  Maybe I'll see him every now and then. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1877.04s)]
*  Maybe I'll have to book shows to see them, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1878.4s)]
*  but at least Ron's here. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1880.5600000000002s)]
*  That's what I decided. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1881.6000000000001s)]
*  Patient zero. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1883.24s)]
*  Yeah, he was patient zero. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1884.0800000000002s)]
*  So, you know. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1885.4s)]
*  And now he hangs out every night, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1886.64s)]
*  and we get Ron every night. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1887.8000000000002s)]
*  Oh, he's lovely. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1889.04s)]
*  He's the, you know. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1890.3200000000002s)]
*  He's lovely. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1891.16s)]
*  We were hanging one time. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1892.5600000000002s)]
*  This is my favorite Ron story, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1894.04s)]
*  and it's just me, you and Ron in the green room, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1895.1200000000001s)]
*  and you gifted him a really nice Rolex, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1897.8000000000002s)]
*  and you guys were having a sweet moment, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1900.76s)]
*  and I couldn't believe I was there to see it. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1902.96s)]
*  I was like, damn, this is really cool, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1904.24s)]
*  and you gifted it to him, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1905.96s)]
*  and y'all were having a conversation. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1906.8s)]
*  I'm like, wow. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1907.64s)]
*  And he takes off his Rolex, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1908.48s)]
*  and he tosses it to me. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1910.04s)]
*  He goes, there you go, Derrick. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1911.48s)]
*  And I go, holy shit, Ron, for real? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1912.6000000000001s)]
*  He says, fuck no, bro. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1914.52s)]
*  Give me my Rolex back, you idiot. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1915.64s)]
*  And then you went, so you go, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1919.16s)]
*  that's the most fucked up shit I've ever seen, Ron. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1920.72s)]
*  I forgot about that right now. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1923.04s)]
*  It was most evil. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1925.0s)]
*  That was so evil. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1925.84s)]
*  And you were, you literally were like, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1926.96s)]
*  Ron, why would you do that? [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1928.44s)]
*  I thought everybody was just giving out Rolexes [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1929.56s)]
*  up in this bitch. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1931.3999999999999s)]
*  I thought that was gonna be a great moment, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1932.24s)]
*  and my face was like. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1933.24s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1935.48s)]
*  But he's the man, dude. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1937.04s)]
*  I can't believe I'm friends with him, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1938.2s)]
*  because I've been a fan since I was a kid. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1939.6799999999998s)]
*  I feel that same way. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1941.32s)]
*  Yeah, I feel that way about a lot of guys. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1942.8799999999999s)]
*  Like, I can't believe I'm friends with you. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1944.8799999999999s)]
*  It's nice. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1947.08s)]
*  Well, that's good, right? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1947.9199999999998s)]
*  You never stop being both a fan and a person who does it. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1949.32s)]
*  I try to separate it. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1953.6399999999999s)]
*  I try to separate me as a comic offstage [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1955.72s)]
*  versus me as a comic onstage. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1958.16s)]
*  I really do. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1959.68s)]
*  So I could just be a fan. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1961.44s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1963.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1964.1200000000001s)]
*  Because when I was younger, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1964.96s)]
*  I used to watch someone going, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1965.78s)]
*  oh, I would do it differently. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1966.8400000000001s)]
*  Like, if they suck, I'll do that. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1968.28s)]
*  If they suck, I'll go like, oh, that premise. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1969.76s)]
*  I think, you're not explaining this very well. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1972.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1975.1200000000001s)]
*  I'll start picking it apart that way. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1975.96s)]
*  But I like to just be a fan. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1978.24s)]
*  I like to just watch. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1980.64s)]
*  Because I think a lot of people are real hesitant [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1982.0800000000002s)]
*  to give up flowers, right? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1984.28s)]
*  As you guys like to say. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1986.5600000000002s)]
*  But the reason why is because they don't feel good [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1988.2800000000002s)]
*  about comparing themselves to this person [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=1992.2s)]

*  Because watching this game, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2004.0s)]

*  everyone tells me that Sebastian used to, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2010.16s)]

*  to judge somebody harshly, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2022.8s)]

*  And you figure things out. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2026.28s)]
*  I was terrible when I started. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2027.24s)]

*  There were some issues. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2037.64s)]
*  And I was socially retarded because I spent, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2038.48s)]
*  like, from age 15 to 21, just did nothing [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2040.68s)]
*  but travel around the country fighting people. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2044.96s)]
*  That's all I did. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2048.04s)]
*  So my version of young adulthood was very weird. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2048.88s)]
*  Like, it was 100% competition. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2053.0s)]
*  That was all it was. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2055.76s)]
*  That's all I did. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2057.12s)]
*  Well, when you hear Joey talk about you [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2058.16s)]
*  when you were younger, he was like, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2059.64s)]
*  oh, he was an animal. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2060.48s)]
*  Like, Joe was just an animal [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2061.32s)]
*  before you apparently started smoking weed. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2062.6s)]
*  He was like, you were way more different about it. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2064.28s)]
*  I think a lot of fighters have a hard time [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2066.88s)]
*  transitioning into being a regular person. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2070.08s)]
*  And I was only an amateur fighter. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2071.96s)]
*  I couldn't imagine being a guy like Dustin Poirier, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2074.64s)]
*  who's about to retire, transitioning to being [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2079.44s)]
*  a regular person when he's been this fucking savage killer [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2082.3199999999997s)]
*  for so long, for so long, at the highest level. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2086.68s)]
*  That's like the highest level in the world. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2089.64s)]
*  Inside the octagon, knocks out Conor McGregor. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2092.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2096.52s)]

*  For me, there was no screaming crowds. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2103.16s)]
*  It was weird high school auditoriums [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2106.44s)]
*  and trying to give people concussions. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2108.92s)]
*  That's all it was. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2110.92s)]
*  That was all it was. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2112.2s)]
*  So, but there was no glory and no money. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2114.04s)]
*  And it cost me some of my health, you know, for sure. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2117.2s)]
*  There's, you know, and fear. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2121.72s)]
*  Constantly living in a state of anxiety [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2123.56s)]

*  Constantly, constantly. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2127.3599999999997s)]
*  And for some weird reason, I was always like, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2130.16s)]
*  why am I doing this to myself? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2132.0s)]

*  Yeah, but there was no money. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2247.7599999999998s)]
*  I remember I got offered $500 to do a kickboxing fight. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2248.86s)]
*  And so if I did that kickboxing fight, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2252.56s)]
*  I couldn't fight amateur anymore. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2255.0s)]
*  And I was like $500. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2256.92s)]
*  So then I can't, like if I ever decided [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2259.04s)]
*  to like try to compete in the Olympics again, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2261.2799999999997s)]
*  because I was trying to get on the national team [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2263.22s)]
*  to compete in the Olympics. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2264.8s)]
*  But somewhere along the line, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2266.24s)]
*  I got a little disenchanted with taekwondo [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2268.92s)]
*  and one of the ways that it happened [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2270.8s)]
*  is I started kickboxing and I started getting beat up [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2272.28s)]
*  because my hands were dog shit. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2274.8s)]
*  So like I was really good kicking. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2276.5600000000004s)]
*  But if I got into boxing and changes, I was terrible. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2278.7200000000003s)]
*  My chin was up in the air. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2281.52s)]
*  I was fucking swinging punches like a bitch. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2282.84s)]
*  It was awful. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2285.1600000000003s)]
*  I could hit really hard. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2286.0s)]
*  If I hit you, you're in trouble, but it was not good. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2286.9s)]
*  And so I realized like, oh, there's a giant flaw in this. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2289.2400000000002s)]
*  Like for actual real fights, there's a giant flaw in this. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2291.6600000000003s)]
*  And as soon as I started kickboxing, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2294.7200000000003s)]
*  particularly this friend of mine who was a really good boxer, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2296.6200000000003s)]
*  Dana Rosenblatt, he was one of my training partners [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2299.64s)]
*  and he became a New England middleweight champion. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2302.24s)]
*  He beat Vinny Pazienza in a decision. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2306.16s)]
*  He lost him one fight and then beat him in a decision. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2309.72s)]
*  He was legit. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2311.68s)]
*  He knocked out Howard Davis Jr. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2312.72s)]
*  who was a Olympic gold medalist. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2314.7599999999998s)]
*  He was a bad motherfucker. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2318.2s)]
*  And he also, when I was training with him, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2319.16s)]
*  made me realize that I didn't really want to do this anymore. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2321.7999999999997s)]
*  That I was just doing this because I had done it [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2325.42s)]
*  my whole life and this was like what I decided [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2327.04s)]
*  that I was doing, then I was like, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2330.1200000000003s)]
*  not only is there no future in this, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2330.96s)]
*  there's a lot of brain damage coming my way. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2331.96s)]
*  Like 100% I'm getting it right now. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2334.1600000000003s)]
*  And just sparring with Dana, me and him sparring, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2336.76s)]
*  I don't know how many times we sparred, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2340.32s)]
*  but we would beat the fuck out of each other, dude. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2341.52s)]
*  Damn, really? [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2343.6800000000003s)]
*  Oh, it was horrible. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2344.52s)]
*  Yeah, I'd go home with headaches. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2346.5s)]
*  And if we were in boxing range, he was tuning me up. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2348.2000000000003s)]
*  So I was always trying to stay on the outside [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2352.52s)]
*  because his hands were way better than mine, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2354.6400000000003s)]
*  but we cracked each other. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2356.2400000000002s)]
*  You and Dana White would fight? [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2358.36s)]
*  No, no, no, no, my friend Dana Rose would fight. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2359.76s)]
*  Okay, I was like, I heard Dana and I was like. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2361.1200000000003s)]
*  But if me and Dana were friends, we would do that too. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2363.84s)]
*  I sparred with a lot of my friends. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2366.44s)]
*  We beat the shit out of each other. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2368.0s)]
*  It was horrible, but that's what you have to do. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2369.5600000000004s)]
*  You know what the beautiful thing about Jiu Jitsu [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2372.2400000000002s)]
*  is above kickboxing is you don't have this kind of animosity [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2373.6800000000003s)]
*  with your sparring partners. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2377.44s)]
*  Because if you're in a good gym in kickboxing, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2379.2000000000003s)]
*  you're always hurting each other. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2383.2400000000002s)]
*  And even if you love a guy and you spar with him, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2384.96s)]
*  you're always hurting each other. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2387.48s)]
*  So you always have this thing where you're like, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2388.64s)]
*  fuck that dude, that dude gave me a fucking headache. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2390.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2392.76s)]
*  You think about getting him back. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2393.6s)]
*  Like you think about, he cracked you with a left hook, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2395.64s)]
*  you're like, I am gonna get him back. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2397.8s)]
*  I can't wait to get him back. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2399.16s)]
*  Whereas with Jiu Jitsu, you can't wait to tap somebody, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2400.8s)]
*  but you're not hurting each other. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2403.0s)]
*  You know, if you get hurt, it's an accident. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2404.8s)]
*  The injuries in Jiu Jitsu are usually either strain related [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2406.72s)]
*  or you didn't tap, right? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2410.0s)]
*  It's either you strained to get out of something [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2412.28s)]
*  or you pulled yourself the wrong way, or you didn't tap. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2414.36s)]
*  And then when you're putting in kickboxing, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2417.92s)]
*  like you're getting, your legs are getting fucked up [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2419.24s)]
*  every day, wham, wham, no matter what. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2421.88s)]
*  And those pads, they help a little. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2425.08s)]
*  Damn, they're huge, those pads. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2427.16s)]
*  When they look like it, when I watch them, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2428.84s)]
*  they help a little. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2430.16s)]
*  Yeah, if somebody kicks you, like if Israel Adesanya [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2431.48s)]
*  kicks you with one of those pads on, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2434.3199999999997s)]
*  you can't believe the kind of agony that's involved [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2436.2s)]
*  in that way to make a living. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2441.2s)]
*  So I was only doing it because I didn't know what to do. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2442.64s)]
*  I was the same person that I used to be. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2445.88s)]
*  I was, at one point in time, I was just a mad dog. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2447.32s)]
*  And then I realized, like, I'm gonna get really hurt [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2450.1600000000003s)]
*  and there's no future in this, you know? [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2453.2000000000003s)]
*  Wow, were you already one foot in, one foot out, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2455.6800000000003s)]
*  or did you just stop? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2457.84s)]
*  Two feet in, but you were like, I'm done. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2458.8s)]
*  You know what it was, really? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2460.04s)]
*  I had one fight, I fought in the Nationals in Anaheim. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2461.0s)]
*  And I beat the first guy, so I got into the second round. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2465.76s)]
*  And the second guy was this, I think he was from Illinois, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2469.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't remember, but he was like super aggressive. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2473.24s)]
*  And I hit him with the hardest wheel kick [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2476.08s)]
*  I've ever thrown in my life. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2479.2799999999997s)]
*  It was perfect. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2480.52s)]
*  He charged in with like a left switch kick. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2481.48s)]
*  So he was like, oh, I did a hopping roundhouse kick [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2485.24s)]
*  off the left side, and I recognized it right away. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2487.56s)]
*  There was a pattern. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2490.56s)]
*  He was making this pattern when he was moving. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2491.3999999999996s)]
*  He would do this thing, and then he would always do this. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2493.7599999999998s)]
*  He would do this thing, and then he would always do this. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2495.9199999999996s)]
*  So I saw that pattern, I said, here it comes. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2497.7599999999998s)]
*  And so he went with his hopping roundhouse kick. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2499.9199999999996s)]
*  I countered with this wheel kick. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2502.56s)]
*  And I hit him so hard that my heel was sore for days. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2504.04s)]
*  I was limping for days, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2508.7599999999998s)]
*  because the way my heel bounced off his face. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2511.08s)]
*  And he face planted, snoring. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2514.08s)]
*  They snore when they go out. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2516.7599999999998s)]
*  Have you ever seen anybody get knocked out? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2518.4s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2519.8s)]
*  On the internet, of course you have. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2520.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2521.84s)]
*  I'd seen it a few times in the gym. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2523.72s)]
*  It's spooky, it's spooky. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2525.32s)]
*  And so my thing, what I would always do [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2527.7599999999998s)]
*  when I'd knock somebody out is walk away [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2530.24s)]
*  like it was nothing. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2531.88s)]
*  That's what I always do. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2532.92s)]
*  That's what I do. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2534.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2535.32s)]
*  I didn't celebrate, I just would turn my head [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2536.1600000000003s)]
*  and walk away. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2538.6s)]
*  And I was talking to my friend Junkzik, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2539.8s)]
*  who was, he was US national champion. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2541.7200000000003s)]
*  He was a training partner of mine. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2544.28s)]
*  He was sitting in a seat, and I said, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2545.44s)]
*  I'll never forget this. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2547.92s)]
*  I'm like, is he moving? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2548.76s)]
*  He's like, he hasn't gotten up. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2550.12s)]
*  And so then they get him an ambulance. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2552.0s)]
*  And so they put this kid on a stretcher, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2553.6s)]
*  and they have him sitting out there for 30 minutes, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2555.76s)]
*  and he's just on the stretcher for 30 minutes. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2558.52s)]
*  And then they bring him in the ambulance, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2560.36s)]
*  and they take him to the hospital. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2562.36s)]
*  And I'm like, yo. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2564.76s)]
*  When he said he wasn't moving yet, did you feel like? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2566.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, he could be dead. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2569.8s)]
*  So this is what scared me. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2571.04s)]
*  So I had this trainer, this instructor, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2573.6000000000004s)]
*  who's like one of the best taekwondo instructors [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2579.44s)]
*  in the world. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2581.6000000000004s)]
*  And I say to him, you know, well, he said to me, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2583.0800000000004s)]
*  he goes, I heard you had a really good knockout [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2588.64s)]
*  at the nationals. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2590.6s)]
*  And I said, yes, sir. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2592.04s)]
*  I said it was kind of scary, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2593.68s)]
*  because I thought for a while that he was dead. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2595.52s)]
*  And he goes, sometimes they die. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2599.8399999999997s)]
*  And he walked away. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2604.44s)]
*  I was like, oh, Jesus. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2605.2799999999997s)]
*  I was Jesus Christ. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2606.68s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2608.7599999999998s)]
*  And he was fucking serious. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2609.6s)]
*  He used to train troops in Vietnam. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2610.7599999999998s)]
*  Like he was a hardcore dude. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2613.68s)]
*  He was hardcore. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2616.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh my God, sometimes they die? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2618.3199999999997s)]
*  Sometimes they die, yeah. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2620.52s)]
*  I think it was Vietnam where he trained troops. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2622.12s)]
*  I forget where he trained troops, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2623.64s)]
*  but he was like an elite taekwondo instructor. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2624.68s)]
*  And his mind was like, his name is Master Jae-hun Kim. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2628.16s)]
*  And he's the guy who runs the Jae-hun Kim [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2633.7599999999998s)]
*  Taekwondo Institute. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2636.08s)]
*  That's his business. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2637.16s)]
*  And that's the place where I came. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2638.3199999999997s)]
*  And he was like one of the few guys that was trained [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2639.6s)]
*  under General Choi Young-yi, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2642.16s)]
*  who was the founder of Taekwondo. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2644.2s)]
*  So there's a handful of black belts [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2646.72s)]
*  that were trained by this one guy. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2648.7599999999998s)]
*  So it was like a different style. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2650.64s)]
*  So their style was very violent and very power oriented. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2653.0s)]
*  Whereas there was an Olympic style that was emerging [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2657.3999999999996s)]
*  that was very points oriented. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2661.6s)]
*  It was just move fast and tap and score. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2663.2799999999997s)]
*  Ah, ah, ah, ah. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2665.3599999999997s)]
*  And they would yell and shit like that. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2666.44s)]
*  Every time they'd hit, they'd scream out. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2667.96s)]
*  And so the Olympic style was more effective [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2669.8799999999997s)]
*  at winning tournaments. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2673.2s)]
*  And so the best guys were adopting this Olympic style. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2674.52s)]
*  But there was an older style that was just, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2677.2s)]
*  maybe they telegraphed the moves a little bit more [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2680.36s)]
*  and maybe it was a little slow, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2683.08s)]
*  but the impact was very different. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2684.36s)]
*  Those guys were killers. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2686.32s)]
*  They were knocking people unconscious. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2687.7599999999998s)]
*  It was very scary. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2689.32s)]
*  So that's the gym that I grew up in. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2690.32s)]
*  So I had this very fortunate place [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2692.84s)]
*  that I just stumbled into. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2696.84s)]
*  You know, I happen to be one of the best [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2698.68s)]
*  taekwondo gyms in the country. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2699.88s)]
*  Especially for generating power. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2701.2799999999997s)]
*  Because they really emphasize heavy back work. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2703.9199999999996s)]
*  He really emphasized heavy back work. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2706.7599999999998s)]
*  It's like you have to generate power. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2708.68s)]
*  If you hit somebody and it doesn't hurt, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2710.08s)]
*  that's ridiculous. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2711.4399999999996s)]
*  You gotta be able to hit someone to just put them out. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2712.9599999999996s)]
*  Would you get into a lot of street fights before this? [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2717.7999999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2720.52s)]
*  Even before taekwondo? [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2721.6s)]
*  You weren't even in the fights? [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2723.04s)]
*  No, no. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2723.8799999999997s)]
*  Before taekwondo, I was a pussy. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2724.72s)]
*  Really? [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2726.04s)]
*  Yeah, I couldn't fight at all. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2726.8799999999997s)]
*  So why would I get in fights? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2727.72s)]
*  I was trying to get away from fights. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2728.72s)]
*  I was trying to avoid everybody. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2730.24s)]
*  I was terrified. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2731.8s)]
*  Wow. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2732.88s)]
*  So I just got tired of being fucked with [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2733.72s)]
*  because I was a pussy. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2734.88s)]
*  Because I would get nervous. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2736.2s)]
*  Because I moved around a lot. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2737.32s)]
*  I didn't have a lot of friends. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2738.52s)]
*  We moved a bunch of times when I was a kid. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2739.48s)]
*  So I was always around new kids. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2741.88s)]
*  And I wasn't big, so they would fuck with me. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2743.36s)]
*  It's just normal. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2746.08s)]
*  And I didn't know how to fight. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2747.2799999999997s)]
*  So it bothered the shit out of me. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2748.12s)]
*  So I'm like, well, there's only one solution. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2749.32s)]
*  You gotta become what you're scared of. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2751.48s)]
*  So you put yourself into taekwondo. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2753.68s)]
*  You were like, hey, I wanna do this. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2755.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I got a job. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2756.84s)]
*  Started working, washing dishes at Newport Creamery. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2758.0s)]
*  Got enough money so I could take taekwondo lessons. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2761.64s)]
*  Holy shit, Joe. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2765.36s)]
*  And then I started going every day. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2767.48s)]
*  So after a while, he realized it would be better [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2768.7200000000003s)]
*  if I was just there all the time instead of working. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2771.6s)]
*  And so he gave me a job. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2773.8s)]
*  I did not know that about you, dude. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2778.36s)]
*  Yeah, so I was teaching. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2779.68s)]
*  So I started teaching when I was like 15. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2780.7200000000003s)]
*  I was teaching people when I was 15. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2782.7200000000003s)]
*  And then when I was 19, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2784.68s)]
*  I was teaching at Boston University. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2786.24s)]
*  I used to teach a class, a credited class. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2788.56s)]
*  It was a pass, fail, A. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2790.2799999999997s)]
*  And I would tell everybody, it would count towards your GPA. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2792.3999999999996s)]
*  So I'd say, if you come here, you get an A. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2794.7599999999998s)]
*  That's all you have to do. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2799.2s)]
*  Just try, you're gonna get an A. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2800.04s)]
*  And it counts towards your GPA. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2801.4399999999996s)]
*  And I'd tell them that at the beginning of the class. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2802.68s)]
*  I go, if you can't come, if you can't make it, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2804.3999999999996s)]
*  just call me and tell me that you can't make it, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2806.96s)]
*  but I want you to come every time you can. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2809.08s)]
*  And if you do that, I'm gonna get you better. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2811.2799999999997s)]
*  And we're all gonna learn something. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2813.3999999999996s)]
*  Really get into this. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2816.2799999999997s)]
*  So I was really good at teaching. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2817.48s)]
*  Wow. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2819.44s)]
*  I was really, really into teaching. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2820.2799999999997s)]
*  That's how you were in there. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2821.1s)]
*  In the gym when we worked out, you had that same energy. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2821.94s)]
*  So it's like, oh, that came from a place. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2823.88s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's what I was doing for a living. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2825.2s)]
*  So from 15 to 19, I was just teaching. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2827.44s)]
*  So what my instructor allowed me to do, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2830.58s)]
*  but I guess I was training after about six months or so, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2833.24s)]
*  he said, look, you could train here for free. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2835.7999999999997s)]
*  All you have to do is teach private lessons. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2839.6s)]
*  And I was like, great. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2842.36s)]
*  So I would teach people, the new people. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2843.42s)]
*  I would teach them how to bow. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2846.28s)]
*  I would teach them how to tie their gi on. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2847.12s)]
*  I would teach them how to stand. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2849.2000000000003s)]
*  I would teach them different techniques. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2850.96s)]
*  And I would go through them and get them [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2853.76s)]
*  so they're ready to join in to group classes. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2855.64s)]
*  Because you couldn't just go into group classes. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2858.04s)]
*  You wouldn't know what you're doing. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2859.84s)]
*  Like that front kick, you're like, ooh, looking around. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2861.08s)]
*  Someone's gotta teach you how to do it. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2863.96s)]
*  So it was always a big deal to let one of your little birds [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2865.6s)]
*  loose into the main class. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2868.4s)]
*  You teach them, get their front kick going, [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2870.48s)]
*  get the side kick going. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2872.48s)]
*  They go through a series of private lessons. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2873.7599999999998s)]
*  I tell them to practice on their own, using the mirror, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2875.7999999999997s)]
*  give them a bunch of things to think about [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2878.52s)]
*  as they break down the movements. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2880.4399999999996s)]
*  And you just literally, I see you do it in there. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2883.12s)]
*  That is what the mothership is. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2885.22s)]
*  It's really just a fucking dojo to get better. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2886.8399999999997s)]
*  And everything is about everyone pushing each other [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2889.04s)]

*  and I even said it on the podcast yesterday. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2900.56s)]
*  Martial arts are a vehicle [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2902.56s)]
*  for developing your human potential. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2904.2s)]

*  I got some demons through there. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2949.6s)]
*  But the idea of like, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2951.7999999999997s)]
*  cause that's so yourself, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2954.04s)]
*  you're dealing with fighting, you're dealing with yourself. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2955.16s)]
*  You're always yourself. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2956.68s)]
*  Whereas I came, my whole thing was team. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2957.68s)]

*  You're leaning on each other. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2961.44s)]
*  And that's what's making you better [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2962.4s)]
*  is how do we play the best as a group? [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2964.2000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2966.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, that's great too. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2967.2400000000002s)]
*  And I think that's probably more beneficial to society. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2968.16s)]
*  It's learning how to play in a team. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=2970.88s)]

*  I am a serious person. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3453.36s)]
*  Most of those guys are freaks. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3455.58s)]
*  I love when those guys get caught. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3457.6600000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3459.82s)]

*  And a harem of gay men. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3463.38s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3464.54s)]
*  Punching valets or animals. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3465.38s)]
*  These guys are, and then, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3466.86s)]
*  but on television I present the news. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3467.7000000000003s)]
*  You want to wear in a cock ring. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3471.1000000000004s)]

*  Those are the ones you gotta keep your eye on. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3480.54s)]
*  Yeah, they never have real opinions either. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3481.78s)]
*  It's all just whatever. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3483.1000000000004s)]
*  It's just a job. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3484.5s)]
*  Bill Cosby was the guy who pushed the most [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3485.34s)]
*  for clean comedy. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3487.38s)]
*  Yeah, isn't that crazy? [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3488.7000000000003s)]
*  Is it though? [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3490.54s)]
*  Is it though? [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3491.7000000000003s)]
*  Like scolding everybody for their language [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3492.78s)]
*  and their subject matter. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3495.7000000000003s)]
*  He was scold comedians. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3497.54s)]
*  That Eddie Murphy bit is so good though [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3499.26s)]
*  when he told Richard Pryor that Bill Cosby, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3501.06s)]
*  he's like, you making money? [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3502.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3503.58s)]
*  A lot of people laugh. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3504.4s)]
*  Do you get paid? [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3505.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3506.08s)]
*  Tell Bill to have a coke and a smile [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3506.92s)]
*  and shut the fuck up. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3508.58s)]
*  That's one of the greatest jokes of all time, dude. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3509.7400000000002s)]
*  It was so good. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3514.5s)]
*  Well, it was so good too [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3515.42s)]
*  because Eddie Murphy could do such good impressions. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3516.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3518.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3519.5s)]
*  In all the accents. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3520.32s)]
*  He's another one. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3521.26s)]
*  Like this just stopped doing comedy. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3522.1s)]
*  Like if Eddie Murphy would have been bigger than all of them. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3523.86s)]
*  All the arena acts we were talking about before, [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3526.02s)]
*  Eddie Murphy would have been bigger. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3527.78s)]
*  Bigger. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3529.28s)]
*  Bro, he was so good. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3530.12s)]
*  He was so powerful. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3531.26s)]
*  Go back and watch Delirious. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3532.42s)]
*  Oh my God, he was like 20. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3534.8s)]
*  Hey, that's what's crazy. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3537.2200000000003s)]
*  Whenever I do watch Delirious, I'm like. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3538.3s)]
*  He was like 20. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3539.9s)]
*  And he's got full command of this, what, [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3540.7400000000002s)]
*  4,000 seat or 5,000 seat or murdering. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3543.14s)]
*  Wearing a leather jumpsuit or some shit. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3547.14s)]
*  Chest out. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3549.18s)]
*  Fucking abs out, dude. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3550.02s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3553.46s)]
*  Yeah, this is crazy. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3554.5s)]
*  But it's interesting, like people, [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3556.2599999999998s)]
*  the past they choose in life, you know? [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3557.7999999999997s)]
*  Movies, movies we call them. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3561.1s)]
*  I think it's called Velvet Prison. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3562.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I've heard you say that to a son once [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3565.54s)]
*  about writing jobs. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3567.06s)]
*  He's like, it's a Velvet Prison. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3568.2599999999998s)]
*  That's another Velvet Prison. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3569.2599999999998s)]
*  But like, I'm sure Damon Wayans had a good time [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3571.44s)]
*  making all those TV shows. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3573.44s)]
*  But it wouldn't have been amazing to see him [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3574.96s)]
*  being this guy that's like selling out arenas [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3577.04s)]
*  all over the world. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3579.4s)]
*  Like that's where it should be. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3580.32s)]
*  And he would still be doing it right now. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3581.56s)]
*  He could do it right now. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3583.66s)]
*  He could just abandon all that TV nonsense right now [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3584.88s)]
*  and go back to it and still be one of the best alive. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3588.96s)]
*  You know that guy records like every show? [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3591.7000000000003s)]
*  He has a camera that he takes with him on a tripod. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3593.88s)]
*  He sets it up, he records every fucking show, [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3596.36s)]
*  and he puts them all on his computer. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3598.6s)]
*  He goes, I've been doing this since 94. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3600.08s)]
*  I'm like, wow. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3601.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3603.4s)]
*  That's so many, and how many specials does he have? [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3605.08s)]
*  No, he doesn't have a lot of specials. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3608.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3609.52s)]
*  Compared to other guys where you see- [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3610.86s)]
*  Not compared to how good he is. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3612.0s)]
*  Doesn't make sense. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3613.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3614.52s)]
*  You just, you know, someone's paying you, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3615.36s)]
*  you go, you enjoy your work, you like it. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3617.7000000000003s)]
*  You know, there's nothing wrong with those decisions. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3620.9s)]
*  And he's obviously very successful. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3622.64s)]
*  But you know, you gotta think, [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3624.64s)]
*  like when you see guys like Schultz selling out arenas [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3627.56s)]
*  and Burt selling out arenas and Tony selling out arenas, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3630.4s)]
*  it's like, don't you wanna get in on that? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3632.2s)]
*  Like, come on, man. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3634.48s)]
*  Talk to me, Damon, I'll help you. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3637.2s)]
*  Oh my God, that'd be sick to see him make a comeback. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3639.04s)]
*  Yeah, I'd love to see him do that. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3641.16s)]
*  I just think, after a while, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3643.04s)]
*  do you really wanna work for somebody? [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3645.48s)]
*  Do you really wanna show up and, you know, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3647.16s)]
*  read the script and do the table? [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3649.92s)]
*  I mean, do you wanna do that? [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3651.92s)]
*  No. Fuck. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3653.4s)]
*  I love just showing up, eight o'clock. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3654.92s)]
*  Oh man, get up four or five times in a night. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3658.24s)]
*  Oh, there's nothing. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3660.8799999999997s)]
*  I love it, dude. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3662.52s)]
*  I mean, the idea of doing some stuff seems fun, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3664.0s)]
*  but to make it my, I saw Seinfeld say that. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3666.4799999999996s)]
*  He was like, man, we have one of the few jobs [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3669.12s)]
*  where people want this job. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3671.7999999999997s)]
*  Like, very rarely do I see it. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3674.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't know, there's no job where I'm like, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3676.16s)]
*  oh, I'd really like to be that. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3678.24s)]
*  This is the job. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3680.4399999999996s)]
*  It's one of them, that's for sure. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3681.56s)]
*  Rockstar is probably the big one. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3682.9199999999996s)]
*  Rockstar is probably the biggest. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3684.52s)]
*  But I don't, at least- [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3686.08s)]
*  See, the Rockstar thing, they could sing [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3687.04s)]
*  the same ass song every night forever. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3688.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3691.24s)]
*  Like, if you're the Rolling Stones, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3692.08s)]
*  you could still sing Brown Sugar. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3693.12s)]
*  Nope, can't sing it anymore! [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3695.44s)]

*  that pitch tents. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3872.6s)]
*  So a tent show queen would have been a featured performer [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3873.88s)]
*  probably in a vaudeville act [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3877.24s)]
*  if the song is progressing forward in time. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3879.8599999999997s)]
*  The fact that she had a 16 year old's boyfriend [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3883.48s)]
*  suggests she's either extremely sexually liberal [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3886.24s)]
*  or more likely prostituting herself. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3889.08s)]

*  the power dynamic is reiterated, [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3893.7999999999997s)]
*  a black woman at the mercy of paying white men, huh? [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3895.64s)]
*  What kind of fucking scholarly take on this song is that? [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3900.56s)]
*  What is that, what are they saying? [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3905.36s)]
*  This is so weird. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3907.6s)]
*  No, that's fucking crazy. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3909.54s)]

*  It's crowdsourced, but doesn't necessarily mean [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3914.36s)]
*  it's accurate. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3917.04s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3917.88s)]
*  Because I'm reading this, I'm like, [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3919.96s)]
*  the power dynamic is reiterated, what? [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3920.8s)]
*  A black woman at the mercy of paying white men. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3924.72s)]
*  She advertises herself during the show [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3927.68s)]
*  and then sleeps on the side. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3929.4s)]
*  What is that? [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3931.52s)]
*  I'm not, yeah. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3932.36s)]

*  They were monsters. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3941.7599999999998s)]
*  Carnies would come into town, these carnival people [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3942.88s)]
*  and rob everybody and steal and probably murder. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3946.64s)]
*  Just dirty people traveling around trying to stay alive [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=3951.0s)]

*  should be reserved for really defending yourself. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4211.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4214.46s)]
*  You have to defend yourself. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4215.3s)]
*  You have to know you're actually being attacked. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4216.14s)]
*  That guy was literally trying to have, [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4217.860000000001s)]
*  this guy on Mali, I'm sure he's drugged up. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4219.22s)]
*  You're on Mali, you're on this, you're on that. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4220.860000000001s)]
*  Cocaine and you're fucking, you're dressed like a fairy. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4222.42s)]
*  You should never exchange violence with someone [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4224.860000000001s)]
*  unless you fucking have to. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4227.660000000001s)]
*  You shouldn't do, avoid it at all. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4228.9800000000005s)]
*  That's why I never had any street fights. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4230.1s)]
*  Like, avoid it at all costs. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4231.38s)]
*  I mean, I had like one in high school. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4232.620000000001s)]
*  I had two, two in high school. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4234.1s)]
*  They were nothing though. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4235.900000000001s)]
*  No big deal. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4237.62s)]
*  But then once I started competing, [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4238.46s)]
*  I was done with all that. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4239.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4241.099999999999s)]
*  But if you do tune somebody up, like they die sometimes. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4241.94s)]
*  Like what my instructor was saying is true, [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4245.74s)]
*  especially in the real world, [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4247.54s)]
*  because people fall and they hit their head on the concrete. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4248.9s)]
*  That happens, people die like that all the time. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4252.0199999999995s)]
*  They get knocked out, their head bounces off the concrete, [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4255.299999999999s)]
*  and then they're dead. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4258.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4259.42s)]
*  It's like getting a giant rock dropped on your head [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4260.259999999999s)]
*  from like a second story building. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4262.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4265.299999999999s)]
*  But you know what the earth is? [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4266.14s)]
*  You know, like the earth, like the concrete is immobile [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4268.1s)]
*  and so hard, and all of the weight [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4271.58s)]
*  of your 200 plus pound body falls backwards [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4274.18s)]
*  and your head bounces off that concrete. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4277.18s)]
*  And it's the most sickening sound. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4280.38s)]
*  Ugh. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4283.62s)]
*  God, you hear it all the time, [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4284.9400000000005s)]
*  like that mat when people get knocked out. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4286.06s)]
*  Yeah, but that's like way safer [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4287.860000000001s)]
*  than getting knocked out on the concrete. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4289.9800000000005s)]
*  But yeah, I do hear it all the time. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4291.42s)]
*  It bothers the shit out of me [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4292.62s)]
*  when I see someone's head bounce. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4294.42s)]
*  When they get KO'd and their head bounces off the ground, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4296.14s)]
*  I'm like, oh! [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4298.06s)]
*  Bro, did you ever see the one [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4301.78s)]
*  when Josh Emmett knocks out Bryce Mitchell? [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4303.06s)]
*  Mm-mm. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4307.3s)]
*  Oh my God, dude. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4308.14s)]
*  It's one of the worst one punch knockouts [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4309.26s)]
*  in the history of the sport. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4311.82s)]
*  He knocks him out and Bryce Mitchell's legs are twitching [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4313.18s)]
*  and he's like locked up completely out cold. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4316.22s)]
*  And when he goes down, [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4318.82s)]
*  now imagine someone gets hit like that on the street [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4319.66s)]
*  and you fall back like that on concrete. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4323.0599999999995s)]
*  So not only do you get destroyed by the punch, [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4325.86s)]
*  but then you get destroyed again by the earth [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4329.5s)]
*  covered in concrete, bouncing off the back of your head [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4333.0199999999995s)]
*  with all the weight of your body and leverage to the back. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4336.0599999999995s)]
*  The head is the first thing that hits. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4339.5s)]
*  Your head flies back and all this weight is bang! [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4341.9s)]
*  Watch this. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4346.86s)]
*  Well, this is a crazy knockout, dude. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4348.259999999999s)]
*  It's so fast you don't even really see it. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4350.14s)]
*  Look at his legs start shaking. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4352.22s)]
*  Yeah, you hear DC saying he's shaking. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4358.38s)]
*  He's shaking, Joe. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4359.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh my God, flush. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4361.5s)]
*  Flush, and Josh Emmett is a little tank. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4363.18s)]
*  I mean, he's 145 pounds for about five seconds [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4365.740000000001s)]
*  till he weighs in, then he probably weighs about 170 [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4370.860000000001s)]
*  and he hits like a fucking mule. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4373.34s)]
*  Look at this, boom! [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4375.780000000001s)]
*  Look at the back of his head. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4376.9400000000005s)]
*  Boom, look at the back of that motherfucker. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4379.0599999999995s)]
*  Look how he's built, man. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4381.219999999999s)]
*  And imagine how much force is involved [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4382.3s)]
*  in that guy punching you in the face. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4384.66s)]
*  Oh, the craziest one I ever seen live was we were together. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4387.5s)]
*  We were in Phoenix and it was when Tony Chandler [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4390.3s)]
*  kicked Tony Ferguson. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4392.78s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4393.9s)]
*  That's one of the scariest ones. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4394.74s)]
*  I remember I was, because I was high too, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4395.66s)]
*  so I was like. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4397.179999999999s)]
*  Well, you watch his soul leave his body. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4399.38s)]
*  I saw that. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4400.86s)]
*  Spiral back down into his. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4401.7s)]
*  I remember how scared I was for this grown man. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4404.3s)]
*  I was like, oh my God, he hasn't moved. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4406.82s)]
*  And you just see that, that. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4408.98s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4411.259999999999s)]
*  That might be one of the best front kicks of all time. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4412.099999999999s)]
*  That's perfect. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4414.86s)]
*  The technique is perfect. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4416.179999999999s)]
*  I mean, and that's a real pitcher. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4418.099999999999s)]
*  That's a live, he made his face look like that. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4419.219999999999s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4421.5s)]
*  He looks like a grandpa in a Pixar movie. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4422.34s)]
*  Doesn't he? [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4428.62s)]
*  That was a scary, that was the scariest one I've seen, [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4429.46s)]
*  but my favorite knockout I've ever seen was, [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4437.86s)]
*  I mean, we were all in the green room. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4440.1s)]
*  I don't know if you were there for this one, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4441.06s)]
*  but it was Whitney's weekend. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4441.9s)]
*  It was like 12, 15 of us in that green room. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4442.74s)]
*  And it was when Izzy knocked out, Poetan knocked out. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4445.22s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4447.5s)]
*  And he got him back. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4448.34s)]
*  That was the greatest celebration of all time. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4449.18s)]
*  At all? [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4450.78s)]
*  All time. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4451.78s)]
*  Fortify your mind. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4452.62s)]
*  That line sticks with me. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4453.46s)]
*  Not just that, the whole thing from beginning to end, [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4454.3s)]
*  the three arrows into his body while he was down. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4456.78s)]
*  Breaks it. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4459.78s)]
*  Yeah, Izzy looks at his son and then falls on his back [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4460.62s)]
*  to mock his son, because his son had mocked him. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4463.3s)]
*  That's how petty he is. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4465.34s)]
*  Years ago. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4467.3s)]
*  It was Kill Bill level revenge. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4468.62s)]
*  So he looks at his son and he falls down [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4469.46s)]
*  like the kid did, a little kid. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4472.219999999999s)]
*  And then he pops back up. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4475.38s)]
*  Then he pops back up and then he gives [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4476.98s)]
*  the best post-fight speech in the history of the sport. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4478.54s)]
*  It was like he wrote it already. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4481.58s)]
*  I remember how beautiful it was. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4483.34s)]
*  I wish you could feel this one time. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4484.179999999999s)]
*  In your life. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4485.7s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4487.5s)]
*  Oh. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4492.9s)]
*  Now watch this. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4494.38s)]
*  Gah! [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4498.94s)]
*  I mean, that lights you up, dude. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4502.42s)]
*  Bro, and then watch this, he finds his son. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4504.22s)]
*  Remembers. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4506.66s)]
*  He remembers, look, points to you, look. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4507.5s)]

*  That's fucking, that's literally. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4517.34s)]
*  That's so petty! [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4520.18s)]
*  That's so petty! [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4521.0199999999995s)]
*  That is so petty. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4522.98s)]
*  He remembered, found him. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4523.82s)]
*  Oh yeah, he's like, oh yeah. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4525.34s)]
*  Check this out. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4526.18s)]
*  Motherfuckin' thing, I forgot. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4527.0199999999995s)]
*  Now, Joe, was he lolling him? [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4528.18s)]
*  Was he, when he looked. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4529.74s)]
*  No, he was getting fucked up. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4530.58s)]
*  He was really getting fucked up, okay. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4531.42s)]
*  Yeah, his leg, he told me that his leg [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4532.58s)]
*  was getting compromised already. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4534.74s)]
*  One of the things in the first fight, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4536.54s)]
*  so the first fight in the UFC, [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4537.82s)]
*  Poetan wins and he wins by stoppage [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4539.74s)]
*  and Izzy said, I wasn't even really hurt. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4542.26s)]
*  I just couldn't move, [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4544.58s)]
*  cause he had fucked my leg up so much, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4545.62s)]
*  I couldn't get out of the way of his punches. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4547.5s)]
*  He's like, but I wasn't hurt, like real badly hurt, [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4549.58s)]
*  to the point where he's wobbling. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4552.42s)]
*  He's like, my leg wasn't working. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4553.54s)]
*  He kicked the shit out of his leg. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4554.9800000000005s)]
*  His calf kicks are so nasty. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4557.02s)]
*  He's like, out of all the people in the sport, [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4559.26s)]
*  he's the worst guy to have kick your calves. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4561.54s)]
*  Cause he sneaks them in and there's two and three [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4563.860000000001s)]
*  and before you know it, ah fuck, [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4566.22s)]
*  my leg don't work anymore. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4568.06s)]
*  And now you're trying to get away. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4569.7s)]
*  It's teeing off. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4570.9400000000005s)]
*  You're trying to dance and pretend. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4572.46s)]
*  So you're putting all the weight on this leg. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4573.9s)]
*  So you're trying to pretend like you got two legs, [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4575.54s)]
*  but he can tell. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4577.7s)]
*  He can tell. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4579.3s)]
*  He hits it again. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4580.74s)]
*  Thud. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4581.58s)]
*  So he had Izzy in real trouble, [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4582.42s)]
*  but he opened up too much. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4583.9s)]
*  He's opened up too much. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4585.62s)]
*  And you know, to order to like close in on someone [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4587.099999999999s)]
*  and bang them out, [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4589.58s)]
*  like you gotta leave yourself exposed sometimes. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4590.5s)]
*  There's risks to reward, right? [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4592.62s)]
*  And the cautious, patient thing to do [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4594.42s)]
*  is you throw a lot of feints [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4598.179999999999s)]
*  and then you throw your shots in. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4599.58s)]
*  But he was just teeing off at this point. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4601.3s)]
*  And when you're just teeing off, [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4603.14s)]
*  you're assuming that the guy's incapable of countering [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4604.900000000001s)]
*  to a certain extent. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4608.58s)]
*  Or not he's incapable, [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4609.58s)]
*  you're taking the risk of getting countered. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4610.7s)]
*  You know, whereas if he just kept playing that game [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4613.860000000001s)]
*  and like fainting and moving and slowly picking and poking [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4616.860000000001s)]
*  and knowing he just charged in a little too much. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4620.02s)]
*  He, you know, he thought Izzy was hurt more than he was. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4622.9400000000005s)]
*  And then Izzy got him. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4626.5s)]
*  That right hand just fucking. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4627.5s)]
*  Great, one of the greatest knockouts of all time, [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4629.22s)]
*  especially when you think about like the significance of it. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4631.0199999999995s)]
*  And you think about like historically, [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4633.7s)]
*  you know, two great champions, [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4636.379999999999s)]
*  one guy who had knocked him out in kickboxing [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4639.099999999999s)]
*  and then knocked him out in the UFC [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4641.54s)]
*  and then he knocks him out cold and gets petty. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4643.58s)]
*  Gets so petty. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4646.9s)]
*  And then after petty gets super inspirational. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4648.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4651.099999999999s)]
*  And gives one of the greatest post fight speeches [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4651.94s)]
*  of all time. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4653.62s)]
*  I think the greatest. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4654.66s)]
*  I don't think there's ever been a better, [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4655.54s)]
*  oh maybe, maybe Rose Namaunis. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4656.78s)]
*  That was right up there too. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4658.82s)]
*  That one made me cry. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4659.98s)]
*  Yeah, I remember that. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4660.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, she's sick. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4661.74s)]
*  She's a badass too, dude. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4662.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4663.42s)]
*  But yeah, that Izzy one, man. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4664.259999999999s)]
*  That's, I mean, he's the reason I never, [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4665.099999999999s)]
*  he got me into the idea of UFC. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4666.82s)]
*  I never, before he got into, [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4668.9s)]
*  because he was under the nerd stuff. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4670.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4672.0599999999995s)]
*  And I couldn't believe that there was a guy [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4672.9s)]
*  who was like being like, yo, I'm a nerdy dude. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4673.74s)]
*  I like nerd shit. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4675.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4676.54s)]
*  And I'm kicking the fuck out of people. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4677.379999999999s)]
*  And that got me locked in. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4679.0599999999995s)]
*  And also like a sweetheart. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4681.299999999999s)]
*  Sweetheart of a guy. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4682.98s)]
*  Oh, he's the best. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4683.82s)]
*  So fun. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4684.66s)]
*  Just to hang out with and shoot the shit. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4686.0199999999995s)]
*  He's silly, he's fun. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4687.62s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4688.74s)]
*  He's playful. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4689.58s)]
*  He's just a real good guy, real smart. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4690.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, he took us to a club when we were in Brisbane [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4692.14s)]
*  with me and Shultz and him. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4694.26s)]
*  Oh, no shit. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4695.1s)]
*  And we just danced till like three in the morning, [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4695.9400000000005s)]
*  just fucked up. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4697.1s)]
*  It was awesome. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4697.9400000000005s)]
*  He took us to like some local spot that he likes, you know. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4699.5s)]
*  Oh, that's awesome. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4701.7s)]
*  But he's the man, dude. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4702.54s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4703.38s)]
*  He's just the fucking man. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4704.2s)]
*  But yeah, the nerd shit made me lock in. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4705.42s)]
*  It's really interesting how different those guys, [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4708.06s)]
*  I mean, like we were talking about like Dustin Poirier, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4710.62s)]
*  like having a regular life. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4712.9800000000005s)]
*  Like the same thing with Izzy. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4714.3s)]
*  How do you have a regular life after you did that? [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4715.58s)]
*  You did that. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4718.78s)]
*  You did that in front of the whole world. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4719.78s)]
*  The whole world was watching. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4721.26s)]
*  There was so many consequences on that. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4722.7s)]
*  That fight, because you were winning, [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4724.98s)]
*  he was winning that first fight. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4726.3s)]
*  He was winning, you know. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4727.78s)]
*  He was ahead on points. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4729.0199999999995s)]
*  And then the fourth round, [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4730.74s)]
*  it was the fourth or the fifth where he got put out. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4732.099999999999s)]
*  It was devastating. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4735.34s)]
*  God, this motherfucker got him again. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4737.46s)]
*  Because he got robbed in the first kickboxing fight. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4739.7s)]
*  Izzy got robbed, in my opinion. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4742.42s)]
*  I went and I watched that fight several times. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4744.5s)]
*  I mean, robbed is a tough description, [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4746.74s)]
*  but I would say I do not agree with the decision. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4750.9s)]
*  I think Izzy won that kickboxing fight. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4753.18s)]
*  And then the second kickboxing fight, [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4755.22s)]
*  Izzy had him on skates. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4757.0199999999995s)]
*  Izzy had him hurt at one point in time, but he recovered. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4758.86s)]
*  And then he caught Izzy with a left hook from hell. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4761.26s)]
*  Just a left hook from hell. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4763.82s)]
*  That motherfucker hit so hard. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4765.26s)]
*  Yeah, it looked scary. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4766.98s)]
*  He hit so hard. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4767.82s)]
*  And he wasn't as big back then as he is now. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4769.099999999999s)]
*  Like he, a lot of strength and conditioning work since then. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4772.0599999999995s)]
*  Doesn't look the same like then as he does now. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4775.42s)]
*  Now he looks way more strong. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4778.0599999999995s)]
*  And so he knocks him out and then they fight in the UFC [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4780.179999999999s)]
*  and he knocks him out again. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4783.139999999999s)]
*  And then Izzy finally knocks him out. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4785.299999999999s)]
*  It was awesome. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4788.139999999999s)]
*  And then puts the arrows in his body [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4788.98s)]
*  for the three times he beat him. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4789.9s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4791.42s)]
*  He said that was like, he didn't even think of that. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4792.259999999999s)]
*  He just did three. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4794.0599999999995s)]
*  He just felt like doing three. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4795.139999999999s)]
*  But it was really the three times he beat him. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4796.42s)]
*  And it just came out of his body. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4798.259999999999s)]
*  It just came out of his body. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4799.5s)]
*  This motherfucker got me three times. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4801.139999999999s)]
*  Fuck it. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4804.86s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4805.7s)]
*  Oh, I don't know who was on the stage that night [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4806.54s)]
*  but we ruined their set. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4809.0599999999995s)]
*  Cause they came on stage like, oh yeah, [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4809.9s)]
*  I'm in the middle of a joke [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4811.299999999999s)]
*  and you just hear 30 people in the green room go, [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4812.219999999999s)]
*  oh! [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4813.98s)]
*  And I thought Whitney too. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4814.82s)]
*  All of us. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4816.38s)]
*  Cause it was just, oh this is a moment dude. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4817.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah man. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4820.0599999999995s)]
*  And you can feel it when it just the way he did it [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4820.9s)]
*  and then when he's yelling. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4822.62s)]
*  But that's one of the most inspiring, that speech. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4823.66s)]
*  Whenever I'm working out or doing anything, [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4826.62s)]
*  that fortify your mind, it plays in my head. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4828.58s)]
*  Fortify your mind. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4830.46s)]
*  Jamie played that for us one time. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4831.42s)]
*  It's like one of the greatest speeches of all time. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4833.66s)]
*  And you know, he asked me for the microphone too. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4835.94s)]
*  He did. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4838.18s)]
*  Yeah, I was like, yeah man. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4839.0199999999995s)]
*  People, earth, I need to say something. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4839.86s)]
*  Listen to me. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4842.82s)]
*  I hope every one of you behind the screens on this arena [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4844.66s)]
*  can feel this level of happiness just one time in your life. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4848.5s)]
*  I hope all of you can feel how fucking happy I am [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4854.0199999999995s)]
*  just one time in your life. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4857.9s)]
*  But guess what? [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4859.86s)]
*  You'll never feel this level of happiness [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4861.42s)]
*  if you don't go for something in your own life. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4863.74s)]
*  When they knock you down, when they try and shit on you, [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4866.82s)]
*  when they talk shit about you [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4869.78s)]
*  and they try and put their foot on your neck. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4871.3s)]
*  If you stay down, you will never ever get that resolve. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4873.22s)]
*  Fortify your mind and feel this level of happiness [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4877.54s)]
*  as you rise one time in your life. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4880.18s)]
*  But I'm blessed to be able to feel this shit [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4882.58s)]
*  again and again and again and again and again. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4885.02s)]
*  I mean, fuck man. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4888.02s)]
*  Damn. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4893.02s)]
*  While you rise, I mean it sounds like something from a movie, [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4894.900000000001s)]
*  like a speech before war. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4897.540000000001s)]
*  It sounds like 15 writers sat in a room [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4898.780000000001s)]
*  and came up with the perfect lines. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4902.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4905.06s)]
*  And then, ugh. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4905.900000000001s)]
*  If that was in the movie Gladiator, [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4907.02s)]
*  I'd be like, oh yeah, that's how good that is. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4908.540000000001s)]
*  And I bet that just came out of the moment. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4910.780000000001s)]
*  I didn't even ask him. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4912.9800000000005s)]
*  I should've asked him next time I talked to him. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4913.900000000001s)]
*  I bet that just came right out of the moment. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4915.660000000001s)]
*  It was just right there. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4917.26s)]
*  It was a perfect event for him. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4918.62s)]
*  It was perfect. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4921.1s)]
*  The way it went down was perfect. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4922.02s)]
*  You never script that better in a movie. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4924.22s)]
*  No. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4926.1s)]
*  To see him flattened out out cold [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4926.9400000000005s)]
*  and then put arrows in his unconscious body. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4928.780000000001s)]
*  He knocked out an Easter egg island, man. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4932.06s)]
*  That guy fucking Boatons. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4933.9800000000005s)]
*  Easter egg island? [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4935.14s)]
*  Huge. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4935.9800000000005s)]
*  Easter egg island? [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4936.820000000001s)]
*  Boatons. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4937.66s)]
*  Easter egg island, is that Easter egg island? [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4938.5s)]
*  Oh, is that an Easter egg island? [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4939.820000000001s)]
*  You know what you're doing? [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4940.9800000000005s)]
*  I thought it was Easter egg island. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4941.820000000001s)]
*  Bro, Alex Burr is the scariest kickboxers [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4944.54s)]
*  ever competed in the sport. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4946.9s)]
*  He's like the one guy above all [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4948.139999999999s)]
*  that I would say if he hits you once, you're dead. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4951.379999999999s)]
*  He just has to hit you once. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4954.339999999999s)]
*  Out of all the guys I've ever seen fight, [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4955.78s)]
*  I don't think anybody I could say that more than that guy, [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4957.82s)]
*  including in kickboxing, in everything. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4960.259999999999s)]
*  He has more power than anybody I've ever seen. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4963.139999999999s)]
*  In fact. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4965.339999999999s)]
*  Even boxing? [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4966.179999999999s)]
*  Even, I don't think I've seen anybody [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4967.0s)]
*  that hits harder than that guy. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4968.94s)]
*  Anybody. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4970.46s)]
*  Ever. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4971.299999999999s)]
*  Ever. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4972.219999999999s)]
*  Ever. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4973.379999999999s)]
*  Except Francis Ngannou. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4974.219999999999s)]
*  But Francis Ngannou's 265. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4975.62s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4978.0199999999995s)]
*  But in weight class, weight class to weight class, [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4978.86s)]
*  Francis can put anybody out too, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4982.5s)]
*  but he's not at the same skill level as Poeton. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4984.22s)]
*  So when Poeton does it, [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4987.46s)]
*  it's like when he switch kicked Yuri Prohaska [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4988.62s)]
*  and KO'd him at the beginning of the second round, [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4992.1s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4993.98s)]
*  What the fuck, man. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4996.62s)]
*  And he KO'd him already at the end of the first round. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=4998.3s)]
*  Yeah, terrifying. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5000.1s)]
*  That dude's terrifying. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5001.82s)]
*  Just absolutely terrifying. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5003.0199999999995s)]
*  That power is just from, this is like from God. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5004.22s)]
*  It's like he's got a gift. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5007.46s)]
*  He's got a weird gift. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5008.58s)]
*  This is different than every, [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5009.820000000001s)]
*  you know this is this machine where you punch it [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5011.38s)]
*  and it registers the amount of power. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5013.3s)]
*  With Francis, it was like 130 something. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5014.740000000001s)]
*  Something like that, right? [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5018.1s)]
*  Francis is like 130 something. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5020.06s)]
*  Poeton got 191. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5021.66s)]
*  191. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5024.18s)]
*  With his right hand. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5026.06s)]
*  And I don't even think his right hand's his power punch. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5027.66s)]
*  I think it's his left hook that's the big one. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5029.9800000000005s)]
*  I bet the big one, [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5032.3s)]
*  the left hook is over 191. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5033.3s)]
*  It's bananas. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5035.18s)]
*  His power, it's not like anybody else. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5036.900000000001s)]
*  So when Izzy knocked that guy out, [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5038.74s)]
*  that, you gotta understand, that's different. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5042.14s)]
*  That's different. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5045.66s)]
*  Like that's the top of the mountain. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5046.5s)]
*  That's the top of the mountain in the sport. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5048.62s)]
*  It's like one of the greatest accomplishments in the sport. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5050.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5052.5s)]
*  It really is. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5053.34s)]
*  Would you say Poeton is the fastest rise [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5054.18s)]
*  you've ever seen in the UFC? Ever. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5055.9400000000005s)]
*  To two division world champions? [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5057.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5059.1s)]
*  No one's even close. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5059.9400000000005s)]
*  Because that guy never says no. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5060.78s)]
*  They call him up. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5062.02s)]
*  You want to fight next weekend? [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5063.820000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5064.660000000001s)]
*  Oh yes, just wait. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5065.5s)]
*  It just fights. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5067.700000000001s)]
*  He fought with a broken toe. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5068.54s)]
*  He fought a broken hand the last time. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5069.900000000001s)]
*  His hand was broken and he had a neurovirus. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5071.620000000001s)]
*  And he still fought. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5074.5s)]
*  He's terrifying, dude. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5075.900000000001s)]
*  He's crazy. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5076.740000000001s)]
*  I remember when he came to the mothership [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5077.780000000001s)]
*  and they were like, the security were like, [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5078.740000000001s)]
*  it was terrifying because he was like, [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5079.9400000000005s)]
*  I want to meet Joe now. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5080.780000000001s)]
*  And the security were like, I don't know what to do. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5082.02s)]
*  Yo, me and DC were in the hallway upstairs [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5085.42s)]
*  in the mothership and he's teaching us [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5088.42s)]
*  how he checks the calf kick. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5090.02s)]
*  How he throws the calf kick different than everybody else. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5092.38s)]
*  And he's having Polinho, his coach, is translating. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5094.860000000001s)]
*  So it was me and DC, and we're both standing there. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5098.22s)]
*  And you know that little area where the elevator is? [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5100.66s)]
*  Where the VIP is? [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5102.46s)]
*  We're standing there in this little crowded area. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5103.7s)]
*  It's like five of us. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5105.58s)]
*  And Politan's kicking my legs and he's kicking DC's legs [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5106.78s)]
*  and he's explaining how he lifts his leg up this way [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5109.46s)]
*  and this is how he checks it. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5112.62s)]
*  And you're like, oh shit. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5113.900000000001s)]
*  And both DC and I, do we tell people about this? [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5115.900000000001s)]
*  Like, I don't even know if I want to give this up. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5118.66s)]
*  Yeah, give us information. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5120.46s)]
*  Because this is like very good information. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5121.74s)]
*  Wow. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5123.98s)]
*  He never gets hurt with calf kicks. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5124.82s)]
*  And the way he checks them, he does like a hacky sack thing. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5127.179999999999s)]
*  A lot of people are doing it now. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5130.54s)]
*  But he was like one of the first guys to figure that out. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5132.26s)]
*  That he does like this hacky sack move. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5134.82s)]
*  So when you go to kick his legs, [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5136.86s)]
*  instead of just checking it, where he turns it into the kick, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5138.139999999999s)]
*  he lifts his leg up and his leg just kind of goes like this [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5140.9s)]
*  and the kick just goes wee. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5143.86s)]
*  It just kind of grazes it. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5146.22s)]
*  So it never pounds on his calf the way he pounds on theirs. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5147.58s)]
*  When it's just straight and boom, [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5150.62s)]
*  you're getting that force while you're playing it. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5151.9s)]
*  But he also has a different style. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5154.18s)]
*  Like he's not heavy on the front leg. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5156.34s)]
*  Like some guys are heavy on the front leg [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5158.38s)]
*  because they want to take him down quick. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5160.0199999999995s)]
*  So they want to be able to like move and take him down. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5161.86s)]
*  And those are the guys that are going to have a harder time [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5164.38s)]
*  getting away from that kick. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5165.94s)]
*  Because you got so much weight on that leg. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5167.5s)]
*  So he just thud, thud, thud. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5169.14s)]
*  And then now your calf is numb. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5172.14s)]
*  Your foot is limp. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5174.18s)]
*  Your foot's just dangling around your ankle. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5175.34s)]
*  Oh, that guy's terrifying, dude. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5178.1s)]
*  And again, how does a guy like that [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5180.740000000001s)]
*  go and become a regular person? [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5182.3s)]
*  How do you integrate and just be a regular guy after that? [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5184.860000000001s)]
*  It's got to be very weird. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5188.860000000001s)]
*  Like Shob's figured it out. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5190.22s)]
*  But Shob got lucky that he found podcasting. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5191.780000000001s)]
*  And he found his car show, All Gas, No Brakes. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5195.42s)]
*  So he found a way to transition and still have a good time. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5198.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, very few guys. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5202.22s)]
*  Because you see, I remember just the era of watching Tyson [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5204.22s)]
*  go from fighting to finding a rhythm [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5206.54s)]
*  So there's fighters like Shob, elite fighters, [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5210.0599999999995s)]
*  top 10 heavyweight in the UFC. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5213.38s)]
*  But then there's champions, world champions, [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5214.98s)]
*  guys who sell out arenas, pay-per-view stars. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5217.34s)]
*  Like Connor, how's that guy go and be a regular person? [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5220.7s)]
*  How do you do that? [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5223.78s)]
*  You can't. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5224.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, there's no coaches for that. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5225.78s)]
*  Where they teach you how to reintegrate and become normal. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5229.9s)]
*  Yeah, RIP George Foreman, man. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5232.62s)]
*  He feels like the only one who was like, [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5234.5s)]
*  he found the grill and was like, dude, I'm fucking chilling. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5235.74s)]
*  He made a lot of money with that grill. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5238.58s)]
*  But he also came back when he was 36. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5239.82s)]
*  He had won it again, didn't he? [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5242.3s)]
*  Yeah, he went all the way through till he was 45 [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5243.74s)]
*  and he knocked out Michael Moore, which is crazy. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5247.42s)]
*  Like, nobody did that back then. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5250.94s)]
*  When he came back at 36, I remember news articles about it [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5252.9s)]
*  and I remember feeling sad. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5256.9s)]
*  Because I knew George Foreman when I was a child. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5259.18s)]
*  Like George Foreman on TV when he knocked out Joe Frazier, [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5262.46s)]
*  when Ali beat him in Africa. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5265.66s)]
*  That was a famous story because Hunter S. Thompson [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5268.9s)]
*  went there and he was supposed to watch it [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5270.78s)]
*  and write a story for Rolling Stone about it. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5274.46s)]
*  But he was so sad that Ali was gonna get fucked up [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5276.54s)]
*  that he decided not to go to the fight. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5279.099999999999s)]
*  So he stayed in his hotel and just floated around the pool [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5281.38s)]
*  and he fucked up the whole assignment. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5283.9s)]
*  And it was kinda, in the documentary, [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5285.58s)]
*  they say it was kinda like a pivotal moment [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5287.34s)]
*  in the downturn of his life [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5289.0199999999995s)]
*  where he kinda like fucked his life up. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5290.86s)]
*  Really? [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5292.94s)]
*  Yeah, because he failed in his assignment. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5293.78s)]
*  And back then you couldn't watch the tape. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5295.62s)]
*  We're talking about the 1970s. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5298.58s)]
*  So after the fight's over, the fight's over. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5300.38s)]
*  You miss the fight, you don't have a story. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5302.02s)]
*  And so he didn't have a story. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5304.700000000001s)]
*  And he went all the way to Africa and just fucked off [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5306.42s)]
*  because he was just being silly. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5309.06s)]
*  And then like, oh my God, I'm a failure. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5310.42s)]
*  I failed in my story. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5311.9400000000005s)]
*  And it was like a downturn. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5313.34s)]
*  His life kinda takes a dark turn after that. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5315.5s)]
*  God, it's crazy how much, because you hear that [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5318.660000000001s)]
*  and it's that speech that Ali gave, [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5320.42s)]
*  which is also one of the most inspiring things ever [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5322.26s)]
*  when he's like, I know you got him picked. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5323.66s)]
*  I know you all got him picked. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5325.5s)]
*  You know where he gets that one? [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5326.94s)]
*  I'll show you how great I am. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5327.86s)]
*  And it's like, wow, to hear that, [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5329.7s)]
*  even Hunter S. Thompson was like, [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5330.86s)]
*  oh wow, every casual must have been like, [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5331.78s)]
*  oh Ali's about to get fucking. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5333.74s)]
*  Well you gotta understand, man. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5335.099999999999s)]
*  George Foreman was a machine. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5336.22s)]
*  He was different. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5338.22s)]
*  You ever seen George Foreman punch the heavy bag? [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5339.5s)]
*  No. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5341.38s)]
*  Bro, he punched the heavy bag different than everybody. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5342.22s)]
*  Because he winds up. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5344.54s)]
*  Not only does he wind up and punch the heavy bag, [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5346.34s)]
*  he has it stay still. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5348.74s)]
*  And he just hits it so hard. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5350.18s)]
*  And it's so terrifying [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5352.1s)]
*  that that's all he has to do in a boxing match. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5353.580000000001s)]
*  He just has to kind of cover up [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5356.02s)]
*  and get close enough to just whomp you. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5357.5s)]
*  Just whomp, whomp. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5359.860000000001s)]
*  And a lot of it is arm punches. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5361.900000000001s)]
*  Look at this, listen to this. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5363.9800000000005s)]
*  Give me some volume. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5365.1s)]
*  And he had a trainer, Dick Sadler, [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5366.14s)]
*  a tiny by comparison to Foreman. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5367.820000000001s)]
*  And Sadler would hang onto the heavy bag [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5369.26s)]
*  and Foreman would hit this bag. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5371.1s)]
*  Sadler would just literally be picked off his feet. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5375.3s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5377.34s)]
*  Foreman hitting the heavy bag [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5379.660000000001s)]
*  is one of the more prodigious sights I've had in my life. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5382.62s)]
*  It seems to me that of all the people I've seen [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5387.099999999999s)]
*  hitting heavy bags, including Sonny Liston, [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5388.94s)]
*  no one ever hit it the way Foreman did. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5391.099999999999s)]
*  So all he's practicing is hitting hard. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5398.62s)]
*  He's not trying to be slick. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5401.259999999999s)]
*  You notice the difference? [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5402.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5403.42s)]
*  The way Canelo hits the heavy bag [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5404.259999999999s)]
*  or Floyd hits the heavy bag, they're working skills. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5407.139999999999s)]
*  I remember when you see Tyson do it [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5410.06s)]
*  and that head is going crazy. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5411.06s)]
*  Tyson hit the heavy bag better than anybody [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5412.540000000001s)]
*  in the history of the world. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5414.18s)]
*  Better than anybody. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5415.42s)]
*  Because he hit the heavy bag with all these crazy angles [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5416.620000000001s)]
*  and speed, speed like a lightweight. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5418.780000000001s)]
*  Speed like a lightweight. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5420.9400000000005s)]
*  It's bouncing. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5421.860000000001s)]
*  214 pounds moving like a lightweight. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5422.860000000001s)]
*  Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5424.9400000000005s)]
*  Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5426.18s)]
*  Nobody was like that, dude. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5427.740000000001s)]
*  I still maintain he's the greatest. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5429.700000000001s)]
*  I think, you know, a lot of people shit on me. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5431.540000000001s)]
*  They say, no way, you don't know shit about boxing. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5433.580000000001s)]
*  I just think that run when Cus DeMato was training him [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5436.1s)]
*  to the title, Cus was already dead when he won the title [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5440.3s)]
*  to like a few fights afterwards. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5443.26s)]
*  Losing Cus, he lost his way a little bit. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5445.46s)]
*  But that run when he was the man, [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5448.18s)]
*  when he knocked out Marvis Frazier, [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5451.5s)]
*  I think that's the greatest heavyweight of all time. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5452.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't think anybody's even close. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5454.660000000001s)]
*  I think he fucks them all up. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5456.9400000000005s)]
*  I think he fucks them all up [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5458.06s)]
*  if they fight him during that time. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5459.14s)]
*  People like to discredit things because of the whole career, [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5460.900000000001s)]
*  but they don't want to give credit to a run. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5462.900000000001s)]
*  When you see somebody have a run that's truly. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5464.42s)]
*  It's all about the run. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5466.5s)]
*  It's all about the run. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5467.58s)]
*  That's why I always put BJ Penn in the list [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5468.58s)]
*  of all time greats. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5470.42s)]
*  Because during that run, when BJ Penn beat up Diego Sanchez [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5471.74s)]
*  and when BJ Penn fucked up Sean Shirk [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5475.26s)]
*  and Joe Daddy Stevenson, when he did that, [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5477.74s)]
*  I'm like, that BJ Penn might be [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5480.1s)]
*  the baddest motherfucker alive. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5481.74s)]
*  Like he might be the baddest motherfucker alive. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5484.1s)]
*  Like he, I would have put that BJ Penn, [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5485.62s)]
*  I would have loved to see that BJ Penn versus Khabib. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5487.54s)]
*  That would have been fucking crazy. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5490.42s)]
*  A lot of people think that's a ridiculous thing to say [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5493.1s)]
*  because Khabib was so dominant [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5494.860000000001s)]
*  and BJ lost a bunch of times. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5496.02s)]
*  I'm like, you're right. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5497.34s)]
*  Argument, I accept. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5499.34s)]
*  Khabib might have beat him. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5502.660000000001s)]
*  He might have taken him down and mauled him [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5503.58s)]
*  the same way George St. Pierre did. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5505.1s)]
*  He might have. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5506.34s)]
*  Khabib is a big guy, especially for lightweight [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5507.18s)]
*  and his grappling skills are unparalleled. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5510.18s)]
*  Khabib grapples and does fantastic [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5512.54s)]
*  with elite world championship caliber amateur wrestlers. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5515.26s)]
*  I've heard stories of Khabib dominating guys [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5519.86s)]
*  in the gym at AKA that are elite wrestlers. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5523.139999999999s)]
*  That's how good Khabib is. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5526.099999999999s)]
*  So he might have been able to do that to BJ Penn, [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5527.34s)]
*  but BJ Penn might have got him too. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5529.139999999999s)]
*  BJ Penn might have got him. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5531.0199999999995s)]
*  BJ Penn, especially when he's training [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5532.139999999999s)]
*  with the Marinoviches and he had an unstoppable gas tank. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5533.5s)]
*  Cause he went and trained with Marv Marinovich, [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5537.46s)]
*  who was like this psychopath football trainer. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5539.86s)]
*  Who had these like radical plyometric training methods [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5542.58s)]
*  and you just, all you did was strength and conditioning. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5545.82s)]
*  It was like, you know how to fight. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5548.299999999999s)]
*  Stop all this fight training. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5550.42s)]
*  We're just gonna get you in the most in-chain safe possible. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5551.26s)]
*  And when they did that, BJ Penn was unstoppable. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5554.86s)]
*  That BJ Penn, if somebody could have corralled him [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5557.34s)]
*  and got him to stay with that guy [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5560.54s)]
*  and then train all his skills outside of camp [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5562.42s)]
*  and then only train that way when he had [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5565.0199999999995s)]
*  his world title fights and never fuck off, who knows, man? [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5567.0599999999995s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5570.34s)]
*  He could have been the goat. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5571.62s)]
*  He was so talented, man. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5573.34s)]
*  So talented. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5574.82s)]
*  That motherfucker, BJ Penn won the Mundialz, okay? [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5576.099999999999s)]
*  He was the first American to win the Mundialz, ever. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5579.0199999999995s)]
*  The Mundialz, the world championships [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5581.9s)]
*  in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5583.219999999999s)]
*  As a black belt, three years into training. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5584.54s)]
*  Three years into training. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5588.54s)]
*  First of all, it's insane to get a black belt in three years. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5590.459999999999s)]
*  But to get a black belt in three years [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5592.9s)]
*  and then win the world championships is insane, insane. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5594.419999999999s)]
*  And that's, without even hearing the context, that's crazy [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5598.58s)]
*  cause I know three years isn't long enough to do any, [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5601.0199999999995s)]
*  most things in life. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5603.179999999999s)]
*  I was a brown belt for eight years. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5604.0199999999995s)]
*  I was. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5606.62s)]
*  I was. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5607.46s)]
*  And you were dedicated. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5610.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5611.14s)]
*  It's not like you weren't busting your ass. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5611.98s)]
*  Yeah, I trained a lot. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5612.82s)]

*  I'm addicted to jujitsu. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5660.54s)]

*  into a junkie, unfortunately. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5669.74s)]
*  Just put that dial, spin that needle towards something else. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5672.3s)]
*  And it's over. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5676.38s)]
*  I knew a dude who was a world champion [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5677.219999999999s)]
*  to a caliber pool player. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5679.139999999999s)]
*  And he was squeaky clean. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5681.219999999999s)]
*  He ate well, he drank water, he never drank alcohol, [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5685.3s)]
*  he didn't smoke cigarettes, he didn't do drugs. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5689.3s)]
*  Straight as an arrow, super focused, [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5692.3s)]
*  world championship caliber player. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5695.7s)]
*  Then he hurts his back in a car accident. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5697.7s)]
*  And they get him on those pills and falls apart, man. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5700.58s)]
*  Gets addicted to those pills the same way [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5705.74s)]
*  he was addicted to being a pool player. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5707.780000000001s)]
*  The same thing that made him just obsess on pool [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5710.9400000000005s)]
*  where he's thinking about pool so much [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5715.34s)]
*  it becomes like the scariest guy to play. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5716.860000000001s)]
*  The same thing got him with the pills. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5719.14s)]
*  And then he just overdosed and died young. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5722.34s)]
*  But he was like, one time my buddies were hanging out [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5726.0199999999995s)]
*  with him and he fell asleep in his mashed potatoes, [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5729.0199999999995s)]
*  just fell asleep in his food. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5730.82s)]
*  They were eating, he just grayed out on pills [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5732.38s)]
*  right into his food and they had to pick him up [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5735.82s)]
*  out of the food like, oh no. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5737.86s)]
*  This is a guy that was like straight as an arrow, [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5739.82s)]
*  clean as a whistle, super focused, always dressed nice, [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5741.86s)]
*  always looked good, thin in shape. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5745.94s)]
*  Just one. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5749.82s)]
*  Just focused. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5750.66s)]
*  One click to the left. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5752.18s)]
*  One accident and then pills and then no one understanding [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5753.02s)]
*  how addictive those fucking pills were. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5755.98s)]
*  The doctors never told you. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5758.06s)]
*  Nobody told anybody. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5759.7s)]
*  Now when you see those documentaries of how people [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5762.22s)]
*  who just broke a leg or something [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5764.46s)]
*  and then they get them addicted to pills [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5766.42s)]
*  and next thing you know they lost their family, [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5767.58s)]
*  their job, everything. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5769.06s)]
*  Many people that I know that that happened to. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5770.22s)]
*  Many people that I know that got injured, [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5772.18s)]
*  got on pills and just lost their lives. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5774.26s)]
*  Jiu-jitsu guys, friends, a lot of people. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5776.58s)]
*  Especially again, back before the information was available. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5779.66s)]
*  Now everybody knows pain pills are super, super addictive. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5783.5s)]
*  Everybody knows someone in their family. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5787.5s)]
*  Everybody knows someone that just can't get off them. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5789.3s)]
*  Everybody knows somebody that died. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5791.86s)]
*  I know multiple people that have died from pain pills. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5793.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5797.54s)]
*  And so that's what got them. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5798.58s)]
*  But it's the same thing, man. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5800.78s)]
*  But that addiction is what makes you great. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5802.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's that thing in your head [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5804.0599999999995s)]
*  that makes you obsess on something. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5805.38s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5806.86s)]
*  It's like this thing where you're trying [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5808.62s)]
*  to figure this thing out [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5809.94s)]
*  and you just want to get better at it. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5810.9s)]
*  But that could be hijacked by gambling. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5812.46s)]
*  That could be hijacked by video games. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5815.42s)]
*  That could be hijacked by anything. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5817.82s)]
*  Let's see, I've seen guys get. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5819.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5821.62s)]
*  Rant, all that stuff. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5822.46s)]
*  That seems normal to me. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5824.0199999999995s)]
*  That makes sense biologically. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5825.18s)]
*  But the gambling one is the craziest one to me. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5827.78s)]
*  That's the weirdest one. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5830.78s)]
*  Because that might as well be heroin to those people. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5831.74s)]
*  Whatever they're getting out of risking [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5835.54s)]
*  $100,000 on a football game. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5837.54s)]
*  I just swuck a bucket on you motherfuckers. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5839.38s)]
*  You motherfuckers. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5841.1s)]
*  Watching people do that, I was like, oh. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5842.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5843.9s)]
*  Gives me so much anxiety. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5844.74s)]
*  Oh, whenever in Vegas and you're walking through your casino, [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5845.98s)]
*  you just see people at that slot machine. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5848.14s)]
*  And they're just glazed over. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5849.58s)]
*  That's like the dumbest version of it, though. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5850.9s)]
*  But the big, risking everything on a game [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5852.5s)]
*  or risking everything on like roll the dice. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5855.94s)]
*  A roulette fucking. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5858.74s)]
*  Yeah, a roulette. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5859.58s)]
*  That kind of thing is so nuts. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5861.06s)]
*  It's so nuts to watch. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5863.02s)]
*  It gives me so much anxiety. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5864.66s)]
*  You ever see Uncut Gems, that Adam Sandler movie? [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5867.18s)]

*  like comedies like Hypnosis. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5898.18s)]
*  That movie was like Hypnosis. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5899.62s)]
*  Like it locked you into this character [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5900.82s)]
*  and his decision making. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5902.98s)]

*  And all the shady characters around, [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5906.82s)]
*  everybody's pulling scams and everybody doing this and that. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5908.78s)]
*  And there's always something happening. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5911.54s)]
*  There's few movies that can lock you into a character [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5914.18s)]
*  like that where you're like, [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5916.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't even agree with this person and I'm so invested. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5916.86s)]
*  And at the end of the movie, you're like, what the fuck? [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5919.58s)]
*  Incredible. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5922.94s)]
*  Spoiler alert. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5923.78s)]
*  But it's one of those what the fuck moments [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5924.7s)]
*  where you're like, what the fuck? [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5927.099999999999s)]
*  That movie, I shut it off [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5929.66s)]
*  and I was just breathing heavy for five minutes. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5930.98s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5933.18s)]
*  I like a movie like that too where you're like, [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5936.74s)]
*  this feels real. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5937.94s)]
*  This feels like it could happen to my neighbor, [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5938.98s)]
*  happen to my best friend. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5941.74s)]
*  Like this could happen to anyone. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5942.58s)]
*  You just get lost in this. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5944.3s)]
*  Yeah, your mind is weird, man. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5945.46s)]
*  People's minds are strange. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5947.9s)]
*  Like, minds can go down these weird pathways [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5949.58s)]
*  and it's like most people don't have [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5952.94s)]
*  a good management system for it either. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5955.099999999999s)]
*  So it's like you're driving this car [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5957.5s)]
*  with no traction control and too much horsepower [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5959.299999999999s)]
*  and it's flying all over the road and you know. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5961.74s)]
*  Ah! [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5964.339999999999s)]
*  And you're freaked out and you're always on 10. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5966.139999999999s)]
*  Like ooh. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5968.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, dude, fuck. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5968.94s)]
*  Another movie that makes you feel that way [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5969.94s)]
*  is There Will Be Blood. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5970.94s)]
*  When you're watching, because that's the same. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5972.219999999999s)]
*  Where you're watching a guy just go through this life [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5973.78s)]
*  and you're like, I'm getting uncomfortable. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5976.78s)]
*  He's killing his fake brother and he's fucking, [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5979.419999999999s)]
*  and by the end, like you said, [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5982.5s)]
*  the ending of that one as well where you're like, [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5983.34s)]
*  what the fuck is this? [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5985.1s)]
*  I showed this to my wife and she literally goes, [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5987.860000000001s)]
*  Derek, why the fuck did you show me that? [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5989.66s)]
*  And I was like, you had to see it. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5991.34s)]
*  You needed to experience this. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5992.54s)]
*  It's how good this movie is. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5994.46s)]
*  I love a movie like that where it gives me an experience. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5995.820000000001s)]
*  That's one of the greatest movies ever. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=5998.1s)]
*  Ever. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6000.06s)]
*  For experience, just like for sheer, [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6000.88s)]
*  just becoming that guy. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6003.5s)]
*  He was that guy. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6006.1s)]
*  You believed every single second of it. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6007.22s)]
*  There was no soap opera acting going on at all. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6010.179999999999s)]
*  No, dude, this is my son, HW. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6013.54s)]
*  The way he talks, the way he is. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6015.379999999999s)]
*  Oh my God, and then you see him devolve [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6017.9s)]
*  into this crazy billionaire, [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6020.179999999999s)]
*  because when we see crazy billionaires, [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6021.299999999999s)]
*  we don't really, and it's like to see how a person [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6022.94s)]
*  becomes a crazy billionaire, [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6025.179999999999s)]
*  because he's not a regular guy in the beginning of the movie. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6027.0599999999995s)]
*  He falls, breaks his leg in that hole. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6028.78s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6030.299999999999s)]
*  He's a regular dude. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6031.139999999999s)]
*  There's a little element of that guy [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6031.96s)]
*  in everybody that's a crazy billionaire. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6033.379999999999s)]
*  There has to be. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6036.259999999999s)]
*  How do you get there? [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6037.259999999999s)]
*  You have to manage that the same way [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6038.1s)]
*  everybody manages everything else. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6040.14s)]
*  Imagine trying to manage being Elon Musk. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6041.780000000001s)]
*  Imagine trying to manage that. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6045.620000000001s)]
*  Imagine just trying to manage that. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6048.1s)]
*  I don't know how he finds the time. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6051.34s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6053.18s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6054.700000000001s)]
*  It doesn't even seem real. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6056.3s)]
*  It could possibly be real. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6057.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because now he works for the government, [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6059.3s)]
*  along with still trying to get us to Mars [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6060.700000000001s)]
*  and all these other cool things he's doing. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6062.54s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6063.860000000001s)]
*  And people are scrutinizing him at a level. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6064.700000000001s)]
*  They want him to be perfect in every way. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6066.78s)]
*  And it's like, you don't get that [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6069.0199999999995s)]
*  out of these wacky geniuses. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6070.9s)]
*  You don't get perfect. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6073.0599999999995s)]
*  You get unbelievable capabilities [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6074.74s)]
*  mixed in with all kinds of flaws [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6078.42s)]
*  that even he makes fun of. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6080.3s)]
*  He's even talked openly about self-inflicted wounds [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6083.54s)]
*  that he gives himself on Twitter. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6087.62s)]
*  He's posted about it with laughter emojis. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6089.26s)]
*  But he's having a good time, no matter what. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6094.26s)]
*  That would be like watching the There Will Be Blood guy [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6097.46s)]
*  also tweeting his thoughts. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6099.0199999999995s)]
*  You would see some shit where you're like, [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6100.7s)]
*  what the fuck? [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6102.74s)]
*  Yeah, well he's not that way. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6104.22s)]
*  He's not like a murderous fucking psychopath [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6105.38s)]
*  who steals people's oil. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6107.34s)]
*  I drink your milkshake. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6108.82s)]
*  He's not that. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6111.82s)]
*  No, but like you said, it's a little bit in him. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6113.82s)]
*  It has to be to conquer like that. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6116.26s)]
*  Well, I think his drive is different than most of them. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6118.94s)]
*  And his drive is accomplishments and innovation. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6122.22s)]
*  He's obsessed with getting people to Mars. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6125.26s)]
*  He's obsessed with the engineering involved [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6127.74s)]
*  in what they've accomplished already with SpaceX. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6130.26s)]
*  The ability to take a booster, [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6133.06s)]
*  shoot it off into space, [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6135.38s)]
*  and then the booster comes down and lands [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6136.9800000000005s)]
*  and gets caught with robot arms is so off the charts [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6138.54s)]
*  beyond anything anyone else has accomplished [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6142.26s)]
*  in the world of rocketry and space science [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6145.860000000001s)]
*  and all the engineering involved. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6149.1s)]
*  It's off the charts. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6151.18s)]
*  What SpaceX has done is it's not appreciated enough [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6152.38s)]
*  because he's so polarizing politically [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6156.3s)]
*  because of his affiliation with Trump. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6159.1s)]
*  And because of all the propaganda [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6160.74s)]
*  that has been spun his way, [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6163.1s)]
*  there's some definite natural reactions [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6164.3s)]
*  that people have to him that are organic and real. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6166.82s)]
*  And they get upset at some of the things he does. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6170.1s)]
*  That's real. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6172.42s)]
*  But also there's a gigantic propaganda machine [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6173.26s)]
*  that's trying to paint him as a literal Nazi. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6175.9800000000005s)]
*  And they're doing it because they have a vested [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6178.46s)]
*  interest in keeping all these NGOs [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6183.18s)]
*  and all their funding in place [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6184.9800000000005s)]
*  exactly the same way it's always been. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6186.54s)]
*  And having a genius go into all of your fucking booking, [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6188.54s)]
*  bookkeeping and accounting is not good [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6192.38s)]
*  if you've been unchecked for decades [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6194.58s)]
*  and you have a fucking, just an unstoppable budget [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6197.18s)]
*  and a lot of waste and a lot of incompetence [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6201.3s)]
*  and probably a bunch of fraud and theft too. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6205.42s)]
*  Of course. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6207.74s)]
*  Yeah, I mean they've acknowledged that. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6208.58s)]
*  One of the things they said, which is hilarious, [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6211.34s)]
*  they said, he found, I think it was social security [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6213.58s)]

*  And then they were saying, well actually, [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6218.34s)]
*  the government had already identified this two years ago. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6219.62s)]
*  Okay, but why didn't you have this press conference [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6222.02s)]
*  and say, did you just cover it up? [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6226.66s)]
*  Did you make a big deal? [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6230.02s)]
*  Did you just stop it in its tracks? [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6230.86s)]
*  Did you reverse it? [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6232.18s)]
*  Did you prosecute people? [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6233.02s)]
*  Did you get the money back? [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6233.98s)]
*  Why are you saying, yeah, we already knew about that? [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6235.3s)]
*  That's not good enough. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6237.62s)]
*  What did you do? [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6238.46s)]
*  How come you didn't find out about that $250 million [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6240.1s)]
*  that went to transgender animal studies? [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6242.26s)]
*  Like, you didn't notice that one? [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6243.780000000001s)]
*  You didn't notice $21 million [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6246.38s)]
*  through Iraq and Sesame Street, you didn't notice that? [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6248.740000000001s)]
*  You didn't notice like fucking, [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6252.06s)]
*  just so much of it is kooky. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6255.660000000001s)]
*  So much money. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6257.700000000001s)]
*  And the way NGOs and nonprofits work, [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6258.740000000001s)]
*  I didn't understand it. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6262.06s)]
*  I didn't know that it's all like cyclical money [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6263.1s)]
*  that's like flowing around. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6265.54s)]
*  There's billions of dollars. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6266.860000000001s)]
*  It's just flowing around. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6268.38s)]
*  A lot of it's unchecked and they've been doing it forever. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6269.58s)]
*  And that's why we're $36 trillion in debt. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6271.3s)]
*  Not good. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6275.22s)]
*  How? [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6276.9400000000005s)]
*  How does it get that bad? [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6277.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6279.74s)]
*  But then there's also legitimate arguments [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6280.74s)]
*  on the other side. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6282.9800000000005s)]
*  Like the other side is making a very legitimate argument [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6283.82s)]
*  about the right to due process [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6286.1s)]
*  if you get processed and shipped out of the country [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6287.74s)]
*  and put in a prison in El Salvador. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6290.74s)]
*  What is the quote, was it Benjamin Franklin's quote [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6294.3s)]
*  about innocent and that it is better to allow [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6298.14s)]
*  10 guilty people to go free [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6301.58s)]
*  than one innocent person arrested? [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6304.34s)]
*  I'm on that side of things. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6307.660000000001s)]
*  I think due process exists for a reason. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6311.38s)]
*  And the reason is it is horrific [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6313.26s)]
*  for someone to be accused of something they didn't do, [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6316.06s)]
*  be imprisoned for crimes they didn't commit, [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6318.38s)]
*  and then live in a cell, [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6320.660000000001s)]
*  live in a cage with a bunch of- [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6322.860000000001s)]
*  People who did commit shit. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6324.660000000001s)]
*  Here it is, Benjamin Franklin. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6325.9400000000005s)]
*  It's better 100 guilty persons should escape [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6327.62s)]
*  than one innocent person should suffer. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6329.74s)]
*  That is wisdom that has survived hundreds of years. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6331.94s)]
*  It's incredibly accurate. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6337.0599999999995s)]
*  And it is the foundation of freedom. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6338.74s)]
*  We have to make sure that these people are actually guilty [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6342.3s)]
*  otherwise we become monsters. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6345.7s)]
*  You can't, what is that, when you fight monsters, [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6347.34s)]
*  be careful that you don't become one. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6350.34s)]
*  Become one. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6351.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6352.38s)]
*  That's very important. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6353.22s)]
*  This is very important. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6354.54s)]
*  You can't do that. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6356.34s)]
*  But also you can't, you also have to deal with the fact [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6358.54s)]
*  that the current administration is dealing [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6361.78s)]
*  with the past administration, [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6364.1s)]
*  allowing known gang members and terrorists [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6365.46s)]
*  to go right through the border unchecked. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6369.18s)]
*  That a lot of them they know got through. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6372.22s)]
*  They don't know the exact numbers, [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6374.5s)]
*  but they know there's millions and millions of people [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6376.1s)]
*  illegally just walked through unchecked [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6379.06s)]
*  and a bunch of them have to have criminal records. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6382.1s)]
*  A bunch of them have to be dangerous. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6385.34s)]
*  And we've seen crimes that have been committed. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6386.9800000000005s)]
*  It doesn't help anybody on the progressive side [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6389.66s)]
*  to deny the fact that that's a real problem. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6392.34s)]
*  And if it happens to your family, [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6394.54s)]
*  and God forbid I don't want it to happen to anybody's, [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6395.9400000000005s)]
*  but if it does, you will feel a sting of regret [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6398.06s)]
*  if you supported that. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6401.02s)]
*  Unlike anything you've ever experienced in your life. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6402.34s)]
*  You'll be like, I mean, it's one of those things [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6404.9400000000005s)]
*  where to support one side of this, [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6410.7s)]
*  you have to deny some basic human values. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6414.5s)]
*  Either way, to support just rounding people up [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6419.34s)]
*  and just assuming they're all gang members. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6423.14s)]
*  I'm not saying they're doing that, [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6425.1s)]
*  but this is the worst case scenario. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6426.42s)]
*  They get a bunch of people in a room, [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6428.66s)]
*  they rope them all in and one guy's just someone's cousin [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6430.38s)]
*  picking someone up to give them a ride home. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6432.5s)]
*  That's possible. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6434.5s)]
*  And now you're back on the one innocent person [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6435.34s)]
*  with, now you're right back. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6436.9s)]
*  And what if that dude is not doing anything wrong [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6437.9s)]
*  and he's got some stupid tattoos [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6439.9s)]
*  and they decide that this guy's a gang member [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6441.26s)]
*  and now you're in a prison in El Salvador [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6443.22s)]
*  and you're not even from El Salvador. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6445.26s)]
*  And now you were just a hairdresser [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6447.18s)]
*  or you were a tattoo artist or whatever you are. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6449.62s)]
*  You came over here and maybe you got a green card [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6452.18s)]
*  and maybe you don't. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6454.62s)]
*  Maybe you were just given asylum [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6455.46s)]
*  because a lot of people from Venezuela [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6457.900000000001s)]
*  were given asylum in America. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6459.3s)]
*  And then you get shipped to El Salvador [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6461.46s)]
*  where you're not even from El Salvador. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6463.38s)]
*  So the fact that that exists scares the shit out of me. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6465.34s)]
*  But also the fact that they were just letting terrorists [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6469.58s)]
*  and gang members flow freely into the country [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6473.54s)]
*  is fucking horrible. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6476.38s)]
*  And when you talk about innocent people, [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6477.78s)]
*  what about the innocent people that got murdered by terrorists [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6479.54s)]
*  and well not terrorists, that really hasn't happened. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6482.5s)]
*  But gang members and this trender, Wagwa, [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6485.58s)]
*  that were taking over those apartment buildings [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6488.86s)]
*  in Elora, Colorado and like that's scary shit, man. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6490.94s)]
*  Armed with machine guns, taking over apartment buildings. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6493.74s)]
*  Like what are we talking about here? [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6496.74s)]
*  Like what are we talking about? [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6498.66s)]
*  You're letting that happen? [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6499.5s)]
*  You're not sending in the troops to stop this? [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6500.74s)]
*  Yeah, and you think that wouldn't happen in your head. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6503.7s)]
*  You're like that can't happen in America, in Colorado. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6504.54s)]
*  Bro, they got a guy that had done that in California [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6506.62s)]
*  and they refused to deport him [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6510.58s)]
*  because they said that California is a sanctuary state. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6512.74s)]
*  They're like fighting to keep a known gang member free [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6514.86s)]
*  in America. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6519.46s)]

*  Sam Tripley style and just decide [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6526.219999999999s)]
*  that they're trying to destroy America. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6528.94s)]
*  But if I was gonna try to destroy America, [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6530.78s)]
*  that's how I would do it. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6532.94s)]
*  I'd take over the political process, [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6534.58s)]
*  impart censorship on all the social media, [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6536.5s)]

*  How you motherfucker. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6601.660000000001s)]
*  Which was getting rid of Roe v. Wade [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6603.34s)]
*  was actually a good move if you were a Democrat [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6605.26s)]
*  because then people get upset [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6608.18s)]
*  and then they really wanna vote. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6609.5s)]

*  But she's talking about reproductive rights. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6660.3s)]
*  Because that was like one of the big things [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6662.58s)]

*  let's not say any current president. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6803.46s)]

*  totally new guy in 2028. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6807.14s)]
*  And this is a common practice now [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6810.1s)]
*  of just rounding up gang members [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6812.8s)]

*  You're a gang member. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6818.06s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6818.9400000000005s)]

*  So this is the best argument for intelligence agencies [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6847.04s)]
*  is that there's real threats. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6851.76s)]
*  For someone to say fuck all the CIA, fuck the FBI. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6853.68s)]

*  And they're on EBT cards where you're getting money [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6880.320000000001s)]
*  from the government for free every month [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6882.92s)]

*  and you get free food and you're a criminal. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6888.56s)]
*  And then one of them, like two of them, [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6890.96s)]

*  No, Joe, what? [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6904.08s)]
*  First of all, we gotta show you the Kamala Harris lady. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6905.92s)]

*  That's not feeling. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6916.16s)]
*  We don't have to show it. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6917.0s)]
*  Because we already showed it a bunch of times. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6918.88s)]
*  It's how you would do it if you wanted to destroy America. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6921.0s)]
*  I'm not saying, so the question becomes [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6925.400000000001s)]
*  how much of it is our own folly? [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6927.68s)]
*  How much of it is just natural human behavior? [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6930.2s)]
*  How much of it is the right wants law and order [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6934.52s)]
*  so we don't want law and order? [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6938.120000000001s)]
*  The right wants to punish prisoners? [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6939.64s)]
*  We wanna, no, that's racist, racism. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6941.8s)]
*  It's like, what is it? [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6945.360000000001s)]
*  That's just teams fighting. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6947.68s)]
*  That's so, yeah. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6948.84s)]
*  But also, I feel like it's manipulated as well. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6949.92s)]
*  And maybe more so than anything else. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6952.72s)]
*  I feel like it's manipulated. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6954.52s)]
*  And again, if you wanted to turn us into China, [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6955.8s)]
*  and what I mean by that is a country [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6958.4800000000005s)]
*  that's facial recognition everywhere, [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6960.76s)]
*  social credit score system that's attached [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6963.64s)]
*  to all of your banking, your ability to travel, [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6966.04s)]
*  everything you do, if you make anything online [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6969.68s)]
*  that's against the government, you could be disappeared, [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6974.240000000001s)]
*  you could be locked up, you could be made [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6976.6s)]
*  a political prisoner. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6979.84s)]
*  It felt like we were heading that way. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6982.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think this is something that, [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6983.96s)]
*  I think it was Metzger that said this. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6985.52s)]
*  No, it was Duncan that said this about Ukraine and Russia. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6987.08s)]
*  He was like, do you realize the Ukrainians [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6991.48s)]
*  that we're killing, or rather the Russians [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6994.36s)]
*  that we're killing by sending over arms and money [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=6998.36s)]
*  to fund the Ukrainians, not saying that we shouldn't [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7002.599999999999s)]
*  do this, but he's saying that a lot of those guys [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7004.759999999999s)]
*  are being forced to go to the front line, [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7006.96s)]
*  and a lot of those guys are prisoners [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7009.44s)]
*  who get released in order to fight. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7011.639999999999s)]
*  So what if you're a prisoner because you wrote [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7014.639999999999s)]
*  a bad tweet against Putin, and they lock you up, [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7016.36s)]
*  and then all of a sudden Ukrainians are killing you [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7019.96s)]
*  with American weapons because you tweeted bad against Putin. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7023.52s)]
*  So it's Putin's way of eliminating any dissent. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7028.08s)]
*  They don't even arrest that many people online [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7035.52s)]
*  in comparison to, or for doing things online [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7037.2s)]
*  in comparison to the UK. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7039.28s)]
*  The UK is getting in on it full steam ahead. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7040.88s)]
*  The UK is arresting people for anything [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7044.24s)]
*  that makes people uncomfortable online. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7046.16s)]

*  Checking into this one time recently, [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7147.16s)]
*  it said that a lot of people may have been arrested, [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7148.96s)]
*  but many of them were not prosecuted [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7150.96s)]
*  and released very shortly after. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7152.719999999999s)]
*  Right, okay, that's cute. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7154.719999999999s)]
*  It's still horrifying because what you're doing [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7156.04s)]
*  is scaring people into compliance. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7159.32s)]
*  They don't wanna be arrested again [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7161.44s)]
*  and they certainly don't wanna risk being prosecuted, [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7162.68s)]
*  but they're forcing people to censor themselves. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7165.400000000001s)]
*  The jump. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7169.64s)]
*  I read it said that they were breaking the law. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7170.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't know which law they're breaking. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7171.320000000001s)]
*  Right, well no, they do have a law. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7172.160000000001s)]
*  They don't have freedom of speech the way we have in America. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7174.8s)]
*  So they do have these hate speech laws. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7177.320000000001s)]
*  So they are breaking a law, but the question is, [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7179.400000000001s)]
*  should that law exist? [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7181.8s)]
*  And I say no. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7182.92s)]
*  No, that law should not exist. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7184.04s)]
*  You shouldn't be able to put someone in a cage [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7185.200000000001s)]
*  for saying, and some of them are not that offensive. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7187.08s)]
*  Some of them are pretty fucking calm. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7190.4s)]
*  Only a 1,119 sentencing occurred for these offenses. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7195.36s)]
*  Okay, but the problem is now go look [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7200.5599999999995s)]
*  at how many people were arrested in Russia [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7202.96s)]
*  for social media posts. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7206.08s)]
*  It's drastically less, but we think of Russia [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7207.24s)]
*  as being the country that censors people. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7210.08s)]
*  Yeah, China and Russia, that's what you think. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7212.799999999999s)]
*  Which they do. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7215.0s)]
*  You can't criticize Putin. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7215.839999999999s)]
*  You can't go balls out. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7217.12s)]
*  You're risking your life. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7218.5599999999995s)]
*  You're in real trouble. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7220.24s)]
*  Not excusing that, but what they're doing in the UK [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7221.360000000001s)]
*  is at a higher level of magnitude. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7226.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, maybe they're not torturing people [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7228.68s)]
*  and sending them to the front line of Ukraine, [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7230.6s)]
*  but they are putting the fear of being arrested in people [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7233.0s)]
*  if you say something that they don't want you to say [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7237.76s)]
*  on social media. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7240.88s)]
*  The jump from 2016 to 2020 is crazy. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7242.2s)]
*  Look at Russia. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7244.64s)]
*  2023, 54 people. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7245.92s)]
*  So in the time where 12,000 people were arrested in the UK, [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7249.2s)]
*  54 people were imprisoned for online hate speech in Russia. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7253.08s)]
*  Information isn't very. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7257.16s)]
*  Russia's 100% accurate with their. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7258.76s)]
*  Easy to find. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7260.92s)]
*  Shut up, Jamie. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7261.76s)]
*  From 2010 to 2024, Novaya Gazeta Europe reported [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7264.04s)]
*  over 30,000 criminal and administrative cases [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7269.639999999999s)]
*  related to social media posts [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7272.36s)]
*  with about 1,200 being criminal cases. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7274.76s)]
*  So they had 1,200 criminal cases. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7276.88s)]
*  Common charges include extremism, inciting hatred, [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7278.72s)]
*  or insulting state symbols. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7282.04s)]
*  That's where it gets sketchy. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7283.96s)]
*  I can't even make fun of the flag or a monument? [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7285.28s)]
*  I can't make fun of it? [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7287.68s)]
*  Nope, insulting. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7288.56s)]
*  Making fun is insulting. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7290.68s)]
*  There's no room for humor in a communist country. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7292.64s)]
*  UK sucks, dude. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7297.12s)]
*  But it's not, you know, [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7298.92s)]
*  Russia's not communist really anymore. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7300.08s)]
*  It's really, it's a military dictatorship essentially. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7302.96s)]
*  I mean, Putin was the president [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7307.8s)]
*  and he could only do a certain amount of time [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7309.64s)]
*  and then he stopped being the president [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7311.28s)]
*  and he's like, fuck it, I'm the president again. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7312.12s)]
*  And then no one's gonna win going against him. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7313.96s)]
*  I mean, they have elections, but what are you doing [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7316.52s)]
*  that guys wind up getting poisoned and shot? [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7318.360000000001s)]
*  And they're like, it's old school. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7321.16s)]
*  Yeah, he's fucking. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7322.64s)]
*  It's old school. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7323.4800000000005s)]
*  He's running that place. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7324.320000000001s)]
*  It's his. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7325.16s)]
*  That's his. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7326.0s)]
*  You're not taking over. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7326.84s)]
*  Man, I seen that picture of him, [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7327.68s)]
*  shirtless on a horse. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7329.04s)]
*  I'm like, don't fuck with this dude. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7330.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, he's a killer. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7331.6s)]
*  He's a former KGB killer. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7332.76s)]
*  He's a judo black belt. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7335.56s)]
*  He's a fucking, he's a bad man. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7336.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7338.68s)]
*  You know, like you don't, and he runs that country [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7339.52s)]
*  and they arrest less people. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7341.68s)]
*  Yeah, what the fuck is going on in the UK? [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7344.400000000001s)]
*  They're leaning into the same direction [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7346.92s)]
*  that I was talking about that was scaring me about America. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7349.64s)]
*  I feel like there's a plot. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7352.0s)]
*  There's a plot to diminish the fabric of society. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7354.52s)]
*  Like if you want, okay, let's just look at the whole [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7357.080000000001s)]
*  overall world and is it fair? [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7362.8s)]
*  It's definitely not fair. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7364.96s)]
*  There's clearly, there's a reason why these people [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7366.0s)]
*  in these third world countries wanna come to Europe [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7368.12s)]
*  and while they wanna come to America, [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7370.2s)]
*  because it's better here and it's better there [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7372.12s)]
*  and they want a better life. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7373.84s)]
*  I get it. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7374.96s)]
*  But why are they fleeing where they came from? [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7376.16s)]
*  Well, I don't know, we bombed the shit out of those places. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7377.96s)]
*  We bombed the shit out of those places. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7382.08s)]
*  We drone bombed them. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7383.92s)]
*  We overthrew democratically elected governments with coups. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7385.32s)]
*  There's a lot of instability that's caused by us. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7389.4s)]
*  We're like, well, it's our fault. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7392.92s)]
*  We're gonna take these people in. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7394.04s)]
*  I think instead of fucking up this one country [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7396.28s)]
*  by letting everybody come in and drag it down [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7400.36s)]
*  to a third world country, I think a better solution [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7403.28s)]
*  is figure out a way to prop up these other countries [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7406.2s)]
*  the same way, I mean, in a simplistic version of it. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7409.16s)]
*  Like if you want everything for yourself, [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7411.76s)]
*  you're selfish, but you want everything for all your boys [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7413.56s)]
*  too and everybody, everybody gets better. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7415.24s)]
*  The whole world gets better. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7417.4s)]
*  So instead of like shipping off jobs to Mexico [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7418.52s)]
*  where they get a dollar a day, [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7421.52s)]
*  maybe pay them real money. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7424.52s)]
*  Pay them what you're supposed to be paying them. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7426.24s)]
*  Maybe give them healthcare. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7427.96s)]
*  Maybe give them, maybe if you are an American citizen [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7429.48s)]
*  and you wanna hire someone to do something, [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7432.88s)]
*  you have to hire someone under the same structure of ethics [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7434.76s)]
*  that we agree to in the United States, period. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7438.84s)]
*  Yes. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7441.84s)]
*  Period, for all humans all over the world. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7442.68s)]
*  And if the money translates lower [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7445.28s)]
*  because the American dollar is worth more, okay, [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7448.8s)]
*  but balance it out. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7451.48s)]
*  Make it that they can afford food, [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7452.44s)]
*  they can afford housing, they can afford healthcare. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7455.2s)]
*  Make laws. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7458.04s)]
*  Agreed. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7459.36s)]
*  Where we're, and then you all of a sudden [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7460.2s)]
*  you prop up the whole world. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7461.839999999999s)]

*  Like why do we still have ghettos? [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7469.44s)]
*  Why have we put all this money into funding [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7471.799999999999s)]
*  all these different things with like USAID [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7474.599999999999s)]

*  Every year, Baltimore, same place. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7483.36s)]
*  We had a cop in once way back in the day [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7485.04s)]

*  And while they were working one day, [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7492.28s)]
*  he found a rap sheet, like a arrest sheet [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7493.96s)]
*  of all these different crimes that were committed [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7496.72s)]

*  And he realized like, oh my God, it's never gonna end. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7506.36s)]
*  Like you're never gonna fix this. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7510.0s)]

*  And all in these areas, mysteriously, [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7521.92s)]
*  all in the same areas that had been redlined [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7524.72s)]

*  of that feeling of I have to be better than some? [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7540.4s)]

*  if you're like creating community centers [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7566.32s)]
*  and robust education and counseling [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7568.36s)]
*  and providing mentorship and paths to jobs [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7572.44s)]
*  and giving people an opportunity to make real money [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7576.12s)]
*  that's enticing so they don't wanna sell drugs [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7578.96s)]

*  You're not. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7584.28s)]
*  And so people don't do it. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7585.12s)]
*  It's that simple. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7586.5199999999995s)]
*  But it's like what you just said. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7587.36s)]
*  Everyone would naturally, if everyone's doing good, [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7588.2s)]

*  Exactly. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7591.92s)]
*  But it would take time. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7592.759999999999s)]
*  I guess you're right, it's not a direct profit. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7593.599999999999s)]
*  It would take generations. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7594.44s)]

*  that were committed in the same area in Baltimore [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7599.64s)]
*  in the 1970s, and this is in the 2000s, [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7601.2s)]

*  It's like this is crazy. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7604.84s)]

*  It's never been healed. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7626.04s)]
*  There's a convenience in allowing it to stay that way. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7627.36s)]
*  You can count on them to vote a certain way [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7630.68s)]
*  if you keep giving them welfare, [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7632.96s)]
*  if you keep giving them food stamps. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7634.8s)]
*  The people that want that are always the Democrats. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7636.52s)]
*  So those people are always gonna vote Democrat for you. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7638.32s)]
*  So it's within your best interest to not make them [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7640.16s)]
*  conservative Republicans or very disciplined [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7643.36s)]

*  before they show up at work at seven [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7648.8s)]
*  and kick some ass and make some fucking money, Wilson. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7650.04s)]
*  You don't want that. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7654.0s)]
*  It's convenient because then they'll vote for you every time. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7655.0s)]
*  As soon as they start making money and realize, [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7658.0s)]

*  That means you shoot a guy more than once. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7898.320000000001s)]
*  I gotta know he's down. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7900.0s)]

*  That's what they're saying. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7903.68s)]

*  This is what it says about that part. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7917.64s)]

*  or property and did not retreat [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7930.160000000001s)]
*  when they could have safely done so, [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7931.96s)]

*  than a reasonable person would do. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7935.88s)]
*  So that right there, listen to that. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7937.64s)]
*  A person was outside their habitation or property [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7939.64s)]

*  That's a good question. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7956.04s)]
*  That's fine. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7957.12s)]
*  That's a good question. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7957.96s)]
*  This rule already is like, well this doesn't make sense. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7958.799999999999s)]
*  It says it specifies the circumstances, [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7959.96s)]

*  The bill would also specify certain circumstances [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7966.639999999999s)]

*  Right, right, right. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7978.56s)]

*  That doesn't clarify that. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7980.68s)]
*  So the circumstances, it still could be. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7981.52s)]
*  It's just that there's certain circumstances [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7983.240000000001s)]

*  And did not retreat when they could have safely done so. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=7998.72s)]
*  When a person used more force than a reasonable person, [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8000.84s)]
*  that's so subjective. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8004.96s)]
*  I don't know what that's not a real thing. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8006.0s)]
*  What about Tim Kennedy? [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8007.68s)]
*  Is he reasonable? [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8008.6s)]

*  I didn't say that's why you need one. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8026.84s)]
*  I said that's why you want one. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8028.24s)]
*  If I was a judge, I'd say you're argumentative. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8029.88s)]
*  However, the bill would specify that homicide is justifiable [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8032.04s)]
*  if the initial aggressor actually and in good faith [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8036.0s)]
*  tried to stop fighting and indicated they wanted to [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8040.16s)]
*  and tried to stop fighting as specified [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8043.84s)]
*  or in cases of mutual combat, [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8046.2s)]
*  the initial aggressor gave the opponent an opportunity [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8048.400000000001s)]
*  to stop fighting. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8051.4800000000005s)]
*  So if someone starts fucking you up [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8052.6s)]
*  and then gives you an opportunity to stop fighting [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8054.52s)]
*  and you don't, you keep fighting them and kill them. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8058.56s)]
*  But they've already started fighting with you. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8061.080000000001s)]
*  They've already, like that's, you're in danger zone. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8062.8s)]
*  Like to be reasonable while your life is in danger [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8065.8s)]
*  is to open yourself up to getting fucked up [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8068.68s)]
*  because it's like, no, no, come on, man. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8072.120000000001s)]
*  It was like bang, motherfucker, and then you're out cold. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8073.4400000000005s)]
*  Like you've already engaged in violence. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8075.88s)]
*  It's so subjective whether or not you should stop [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8078.64s)]
*  or not stop. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8081.96s)]
*  Like when you should stop is when that person's [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8083.0s)]
*  100% incapacitated and that might mean kill them [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8085.0s)]
*  if you don't know what's gonna stop them. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8089.4s)]
*  If you have a gun and someone is charging at you [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8090.799999999999s)]
*  with a fucking machete and you bang, bang, bang [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8093.2s)]
*  while they're still alive and that winds up killing them, [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8096.919999999999s)]
*  you could have just shot them once. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8099.639999999999s)]
*  You could be in front of a jury and they could say, [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8101.08s)]
*  you could have stopped with the first bullet. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8103.839999999999s)]
*  And then you have a coroner says, [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8105.839999999999s)]
*  yes, the first bullet was fatal. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8107.24s)]
*  Or yes, the first bullet would have stopped him, [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8108.879999999999s)]
*  but he shot him two additional times. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8110.599999999999s)]
*  Like now you're in jail. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8113.04s)]
*  Now you're in jail because you were terrified of your life [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8116.04s)]
*  and you thought you were gonna die [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8118.96s)]
*  and you did something in a split moment [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8119.92s)]
*  where you're not even thinking straight. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8121.84s)]
*  Like you're, [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8123.4s)]
*  ah, ah, ah, shit, dude. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8124.24s)]
*  To ask an accountant to keep his shit together. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8127.44s)]
*  Look, if you ask a Navy SEAL to keep his shit together [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8130.84s)]
*  and they're fucking, they're probably like, [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8133.5599999999995s)]
*  oh, finally, someone broke into my house. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8135.36s)]
*  Oh, this motherfucker's going to, yeah. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8136.88s)]
*  But some guy actually did try to break into Tim Kennedy's [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8138.32s)]
*  house and he, you know, he didn't even hurt the guy. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8140.68s)]
*  He just said, you made a giant mistake. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8144.08s)]
*  He came out with a gun and got rid of the guy. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8147.84s)]
*  That's like those guys who start bar fights with UFC, [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8150.64s)]
*  like with UFC, you know, you see those kind of videos [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8152.68s)]
*  where you're like, oh brother. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8155.32s)]
*  You see the Joe Schilling one, right? [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8156.16s)]
*  Oh, he bumps, he kind of like, [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8158.0s)]
*  some dudes dancing and just being a dick. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8159.5599999999995s)]
*  And then he gets him at the bar and just, [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8161.96s)]
*  ba-bump, ba-bump, it's so quick. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8163.48s)]
*  Dude tried to get him to flinch. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8165.04s)]
*  He like, like. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8166.44s)]
*  Yeah, he jumped at him. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8167.28s)]
*  Jumped at him and he just, ding, ding, ding. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8168.24s)]
*  The wrong dude. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8170.84s)]
*  You mean, that's karma. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8172.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8173.16s)]
*  That's almost like, those things like almost make me feel [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8174.0s)]
*  like we're in a simulation. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8176.12s)]
*  Like that's not supposed to happen in that order. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8178.639999999999s)]
*  You know, like when someone just hits a level of douchiness [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8181.16s)]
*  and in this, you're supposed to run into Joe Schilling. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8184.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8186.96s)]
*  That's the perfect karmic response to like negative [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8187.8s)]
*  and a positive and a thing, you know, [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8191.24s)]
*  like go in and out. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8193.0s)]
*  We just, I just feel like we have to be really careful [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8194.76s)]
*  in this country that we don't get more divided [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8197.68s)]
*  by all this fucking political chaos that we're experiencing. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8201.44s)]
*  We gotta be real careful, like as human beings, [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8205.039999999999s)]
*  that we don't fall prey to that. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8207.24s)]
*  This is not, it's not smart for anybody. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8208.8s)]
*  No, dude. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8212.48s)]
*  It's not smart. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8213.32s)]
*  And we're just, it's so much unnecessary conflict, [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8214.14s)]
*  you know? [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8218.279999999999s)]
*  Well, it's usually, and it's just people picking [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8219.119999999999s)]
*  that one side and like you said, like you can't, [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8220.6s)]
*  of course, I don't think people should be coming [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8223.68s)]
*  into the country and all that stuff, [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8225.64s)]
*  but I also do think women should be able to do [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8226.56s)]
*  what they want with the fucking baby in their stomach. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8228.6s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8230.68s)]
*  Up to a point, right? [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8231.52s)]
*  Up to a point, of course. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8232.36s)]
*  But like you said, if some woman got raped [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8233.44s)]
*  and she's pregnant now, like yeah, let her, [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8235.48s)]
*  what are we doing right now? [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8237.800000000001s)]
*  What are we doing? [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8238.64s)]
*  What are we doing? [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8239.48s)]
*  Where's the human aspect of it? [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8240.300000000001s)]
*  And then also like if you don't feel for people [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8241.64s)]
*  that walked here with their babies [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8243.66s)]
*  because they just want to get a job as a landscaper, [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8245.12s)]
*  like I get it. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8247.48s)]
*  Let them have it. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8248.32s)]
*  I just, but how do you know? [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8249.16s)]
*  You know, like I think the process [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8251.36s)]
*  for getting people in should be better, [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8253.24s)]
*  but it's also, it's like how many can we support? [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8254.98s)]
*  Like what kind of a strain is this on Social Security? [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8258.08s)]
*  What kind of a strain is this on Medicare? [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8261.6s)]
*  You know, have this been, [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8263.6s)]
*  and is there a way to like make where they're from better? [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8265.12s)]
*  And wouldn't that like increase revenues? [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8268.6s)]
*  Like if all of a sudden you had another country [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8271.04s)]
*  right next door that's buying and trading [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8274.04s)]
*  and making tons of money, [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8276.62s)]
*  wouldn't that be better for everybody? [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8277.84s)]
*  Like if they stopped being a third world country [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8279.64s)]
*  and became a first world country, [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8281.76s)]
*  wouldn't that like be like super beneficial? [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8282.960000000001s)]
*  Has that never come up in any of these, [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8285.04s)]
*  you ain't like, oh, why don't we just try to [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8286.72s)]
*  make this place a better place? [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8288.84s)]
*  This is what you got to realize [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8291.119999999999s)]
*  when it comes to politicians. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8292.34s)]
*  Most of them are already dead or on their way. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8293.46s)]
*  Unless you're JD Vance, he's really young. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8297.24s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard's young. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8299.24s)]
*  Yeah, Tulsi's the shit. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8300.359999999999s)]
*  Most of these people, when you're in office, [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8301.199999999999s)]
*  like Trump is almost 80. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8304.32s)]
*  Biden, did you see what Biden said yesterday? [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8305.96s)]

*  Oh, Jay, did you see it? [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8309.0s)]
*  Nope. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8310.679999999998s)]
*  Hey, they let him talk. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8311.519999999999s)]
*  He's like what, 80 something, 90? [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8315.52s)]
*  Out of nowhere, they let, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8317.48s)]
*  They're letting him talk and I'm like, [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8319.039999999999s)]

*  He's gone and they let him talk. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8328.92s)]
*  They just let him get out in the open [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8330.74s)]
*  and put a microphone in front of his face. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8332.56s)]
*  But I guess like as a former president, [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8335.16s)]

*  just like it does, I mean, [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8392.4s)]

*  I'm not assuming or accusing anybody doing this, [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8531.64s)]
*  but I would imagine if you got ahold of that auto-penn, [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8535.12s)]
*  be like, yo, yo, yo, I got the auto-penn. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8538.28s)]

*  Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8550.24s)]
*  Just hit that button. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8552.08s)]
*  I mean, how many times? [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8552.92s)]
*  First of all, if you can't be tried, [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8553.74s)]
*  because they decide that you're mentally incapable [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8555.64s)]
*  of standing trial, that's what they said about him. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8558.0s)]
*  They were gonna try him on some classified documents case. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8560.24s)]
*  They said the judge ruled [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8565.359999999999s)]
*  that he was incapable of standing trial [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8567.16s)]
*  while he was running for president for the second term. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8569.279999999999s)]

*  they were saying he's incapable of standing trial. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8574.68s)]
*  So if we're saying that there's something wrong [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8577.2s)]
*  with him cognitively, [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8578.720000000001s)]
*  but we're still allowing him to give people pardons? [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8580.560000000001s)]
*  Like if he can't, if he's not sane enough, [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8583.6s)]
*  if he's not there enough to stand trial, [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8587.28s)]
*  how could he be there enough to decide [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8590.52s)]
*  whether or not someone deserves a pardon? [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8593.44s)]
*  That seems insane. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8595.18s)]
*  And then how could you use the auto-penn? [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8596.480000000001s)]
*  He's like, what about that guy? [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8600.52s)]

*  He just, 9,000. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8606.52s)]
*  There's no way. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8608.76s)]
*  If you have all the time in the world, [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8609.6s)]
*  how are you going over 9,000 cases? [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8611.92s)]
*  Most of those were the marijuana releases. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8614.56s)]
*  Well, that's nice. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8617.2s)]
*  The federal. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8618.04s)]

*  Like 6,500 or so. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8620.54s)]
*  Oh, that's nice. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8621.64s)]
*  But auto-pinning it is, [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8622.92s)]
*  when you think about what that means, that it's crazy. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8624.1s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8626.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8627.4s)]
*  It's just, is that shit for sale? [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8628.76s)]
*  Pardons are crazy anyway. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8630.88s)]
*  You just let somebody out of jail, [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8635.64s)]
*  because you're the king. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8636.8s)]

*  6,500, I agree with. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8658.92s)]

*  I feel bad. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8664.16s)]
*  That's the craziest shit. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8665.0s)]
*  That there were people in Colorado [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8666.12s)]
*  that were in jail for selling marijuana, [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8668.08s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8687.720000000001s)]
*  See, that's the good thing about progressive governments. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8688.56s)]
*  Progressive governments like Colorado, [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8691.32s)]
*  they realize that people's right to experiment [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8693.16s)]
*  with all kinds of different things, including alcohol. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8698.279999999999s)]
*  But also, you should have the freedom to take things. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8700.92s)]
*  You should have the freedom [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8704.279999999999s)]
*  to explore your own consciousness. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8705.8s)]
*  And Colorado agreed with that real early. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8708.64s)]
*  That's the good thing about progressive governments. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8711.76s)]
*  And that's the bad thing [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8713.519999999999s)]
*  about a lot of conservative governments. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8714.439999999999s)]
*  They wanna stop you from doing that. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8716.56s)]
*  They wanna prosecute people for that fucking grass. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8719.32s)]
*  That dirty dirt. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8722.08s)]
*  Where's your dope? [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8723.08s)]
*  You fucking dope. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8725.04s)]
*  Yeah, they don't like it when your mind opens up a little bit. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8726.04s)]
*  But you said it earlier. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8728.16s)]
*  Oh man, if we could just get everybody on mushrooms, [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8729.08s)]
*  everybody might love each other and all these things. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8730.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8732.32s)]
*  That is scary. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8733.16s)]
*  I don't think you can think that way, though. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8734.0s)]
*  8,000. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8735.16s)]
*  A record-setting number includes a collective act [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8737.12s)]
*  of over 6,500 individuals [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8739.68s)]
*  for marijuana possession convictions. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8741.68s)]
*  So it's really not like he has more than anybody else. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8744.04s)]
*  Yeah, Washington did it. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8748.84s)]
*  So it just looks like, yeah, [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8749.68s)]
*  it looks like more than everybody else [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8750.52s)]
*  because it's just 6,500. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8753.16s)]
*  He actually only released 1,500 then. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8755.24s)]
*  Yeah, look at Andrew Johnson. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8758.36s)]
*  It ended up being closer to 9,000, I think, [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8759.720000000001s)]
*  at the end of the day. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8761.68s)]
*  Oh, at the end? [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8762.52s)]
*  It's just like 2,500. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8763.36s)]
*  So even then, 2,500, not pretty normal. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8764.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8766.84s)]
*  Like how many did... [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8767.68s)]
*  Obama did... [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8769.6s)]
*  Almost 2,000. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8771.24s)]
*  It was a different list I had. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8772.08s)]
*  What about Trump? [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8773.2s)]
*  He did 1,500 on the first day [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8774.6s)]
*  because it was all the January 6th people. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8776.0s)]
*  How come Trump didn't free Joe Exotic? [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8777.28s)]
*  Let him go. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8780.16s)]
*  Let the Tiger King out there. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8781.0s)]
*  Tiger King, three. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8782.119999999999s)]
*  We need it. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8783.28s)]
*  He only did 230 on the first term. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8784.119999999999s)]
*  Oh, only 237. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8787.48s)]
*  That's not a lot. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8788.84s)]
*  Oh, so the new one, when he came back, [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8790.56s)]
*  he pardoned 1,500 individuals connected to general. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8792.68s)]
*  They keep saying capital riots. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8795.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8798.8s)]
*  But Andrew Johnson, 8,000. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8801.64s)]
*  Pardons, that's what it said. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8803.96s)]
*  Andrew Johnson, 1,900. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8804.96s)]
*  He sold those bitches. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8806.28s)]
*  For silver coins. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8808.12s)]
*  Sitting in his fucking bathtub with all these silver coins. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8810.76s)]
*  Hehehehe. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8813.400000000001s)]

*  But that's crazy that pardons were going back [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8819.76s)]
*  all the way to George Washington. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8821.240000000002s)]

*  That is pretty crazy. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8880.880000000001s)]
*  I'll tell you what, my kids are addicted to it. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8881.960000000001s)]
*  When I read it, I read it like a month ago. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8884.84s)]
*  I just found out about both these things. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8887.28s)]
*  Really? [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8889.16s)]
*  I knew Harry Potter, I saw the movie, [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8890.0s)]
*  I knocked it all out. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8891.2s)]
*  Wow. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8892.560000000001s)]
*  I knocked the whole thing out. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8893.4s)]
*  How is it? [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8894.24s)]
*  Is it better than the movie? [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8896.28s)]
*  It's not even close. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8897.4s)]
*  And I love the movies. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8898.480000000001s)]
*  Movies are great, but it's so fucking good [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8899.68s)]
*  and so in-depth and so, I mean, [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8902.84s)]
*  it's the classic hero's story, you know, [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8905.0s)]
*  a hero's tale, but it's so fucking good. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8906.32s)]
*  And rereading it and just how deep the characters are [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8910.08s)]
*  and how incredible it is, it's beautiful. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8912.960000000001s)]
*  But Hamilton is number two, greatest art. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8916.32s)]
*  And I mean, when I say art, I mean anything ever written, [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8918.08s)]
*  painted, musically sung. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8920.52s)]
*  Really? [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8922.800000000001s)]
*  One, two. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8923.640000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8924.880000000001s)]
*  And then the Bible? [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8925.72s)]
*  Maybe the Departed. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8927.92s)]
*  Departed might be three. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8929.28s)]
*  You haven't seen Departed, man. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8930.12s)]
*  When that elevator opens up and Leo gets his head [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8931.960000000001s)]
*  blown off and they go, I feel it still. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8933.64s)]
*  Departed might be three. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8935.44s)]
*  Oh, you just killed all your credibility. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8937.28s)]
*  He took Departed over Apocalypse Now. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8939.08s)]
*  Oh, Apocalypse Now, that's great. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8943.28s)]
*  How dare you take Departed over Apocalypse Now. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8944.92s)]
*  I love Apocalypse Now. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8947.12s)]
*  But Hamilton, Joe. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8948.72s)]
*  That good. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8950.12s)]
*  Brother, it's so, if you like history, [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8950.960000000001s)]
*  because I'm not a history guy. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8953.640000000001s)]
*  I'm not, Hasan, me and Hasan talk about it, [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8954.84s)]
*  because he loves history. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8956.4s)]
*  And I know what I know, but I'm not looking for it. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8957.24s)]
*  I watched this shit, man. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8960.640000000001s)]
*  It was so cool. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8962.16s)]
*  Everything is educational. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8963.24s)]
*  The whole thing, and you think it's gay, [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8964.44s)]
*  because it's like, oh, it's a musical. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8966.24s)]
*  Everyone's black, like why is Thomas Jefferson black? [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8967.92s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8970.24s)]
*  Everyone in the play is black [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8971.08s)]
*  and they're all playing these guys, [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8972.16s)]
*  Thomas Jefferson, Washington. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8973.24s)]
*  But everything is singing. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8974.52s)]
*  The whole thing is singing. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8976.16s)]
*  So the writing is incredible. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8977.28s)]
*  And it's literally the story of Alexander Hamilton. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8978.800000000001s)]
*  And I had no idea how important this man was. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8981.800000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8984.56s)]
*  He was an orphan. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8985.4s)]
*  And then you know that it ends, of course, [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8986.6s)]
*  with the duel between him and Burr, [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8988.48s)]
*  which is insane. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8990.2s)]
*  Burr was vice president when he killed the treasurer. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8991.04s)]
*  Really? [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8994.64s)]
*  Hamilton was treasurer and he killed him in a duel [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8996.04s)]
*  while he was vice president. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=8999.880000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9002.16s)]
*  Because they had 15 years of beef [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9003.12s)]
*  and you get to see why they've been beefing. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9004.64s)]
*  It's just two ideologies of this man grew up orphan, [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9006.2s)]
*  mom died, dad left him. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9009.800000000001s)]
*  He's from the Caribbean, Alexander Hamilton. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9012.4s)]
*  He's just an absolute genius [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9013.4s)]
*  who had to come out of the absolute mud. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9015.24s)]
*  Aaron Burr is a trust fund kid [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9017.48s)]
*  who is a politician through and through. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9019.359999999999s)]
*  He was raised to be a politician [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9021.119999999999s)]
*  who never, you know, his cards are close to his chest [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9022.32s)]
*  and he never shows anybody what he's thinking. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9024.92s)]
*  True politician. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9026.56s)]
*  Hamilton's a wild guy. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9027.4s)]
*  I mean everything from just the way, [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9029.72s)]
*  he didn't like how Hamilton always is talking [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9031.359999999999s)]
*  and Hamilton is a loud guy [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9033.279999999999s)]
*  and he's just rambunctious [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9035.76s)]
*  and didn't follow the rules of politics. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9038.88s)]
*  He was very, you know, a wild guy. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9040.72s)]
*  He was also young and Burr was like, [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9041.96s)]
*  no, you do it this way, you do it this way, [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9044.119999999999s)]
*  that's how you're supposed to do it. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9046.16s)]
*  So that happened for 15 years [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9047.0s)]
*  and then what made him kill him was, [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9049.0s)]
*  Burr was gonna be president, [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9052.279999999999s)]
*  he was going against Jefferson. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9053.279999999999s)]
*  Jefferson and Hamilton had been beefing, [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9054.72s)]
*  they hate each other. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9056.72s)]
*  But Hamilton didn't like Burr so much [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9058.039999999999s)]
*  because he said at least Jefferson stands for something. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9059.92s)]
*  And the last vote to make Jefferson president over Burr [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9062.439999999999s)]
*  was Hamilton. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9066.519999999999s)]
*  And so that, and then of course he talked some more shit [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9067.359999999999s)]
*  about him and then Aaron Burr was like, [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9070.08s)]
*  we're dueling, fuck you. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9071.32s)]
*  With musket guns. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9073.44s)]
*  Musket guns. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9074.4s)]
*  Those old school bullshit guns. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9075.32s)]
*  Because he shot, Burr, I mean, [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9077.24s)]
*  Hamilton wasn't trying to kill him. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9078.96s)]
*  He shot over his head, [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9080.2s)]
*  because that was like a thing you do [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9081.32s)]
*  if you weren't trying to kill somebody [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9082.16s)]
*  but you were like, I'm letting you know, [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9083.16s)]
*  but like we're dueling but I'm not trying to kill you. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9084.0s)]
*  But he didn't know because he shot first. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9085.96s)]
*  Burr just thought he missed. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9088.08s)]
*  So he shot him right in the fucking stomach, [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9090.4s)]
*  right in the wrist, killed him. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9091.96s)]
*  And it was at the same, it was like a few miles away, [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9094.6s)]
*  maybe like near, right near the same spot [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9096.8s)]
*  where Hamilton's son died three years before. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9098.28s)]
*  Like the law, that law of knowing when it's too much. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9100.08s)]
*  Like he could have just shot over him. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9104.560000000001s)]
*  Could have. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9106.04s)]
*  The other guy shot over him. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9106.880000000001s)]
*  But I thought you just missed. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9107.7s)]
*  How am I supposed to know? [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9109.08s)]
*  I thought you were trying to kill me. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9109.92s)]
*  I thought you were trying to kill me. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9110.76s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9111.6s)]
*  And no one saw it because you know, [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9112.44s)]
*  so to have a duel you had to have other people there. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9113.76s)]
*  You had to have a doctor, [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9115.6s)]
*  you had to have two people had to have representatives, [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9116.44s)]
*  all this stuff, but everyone turns around. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9118.08s)]
*  So that way there's no, no one could go to prison for it. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9120.04s)]
*  So they tried Burr for it, but there's no eyewitness. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9122.44s)]
*  Wow. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9125.12s)]
*  And it ruined the rest of Burr's life. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9125.960000000001s)]
*  The rest of Burr's life because everyone loved Hamilton. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9127.28s)]
*  Because Hamilton was George Washington's right hand man. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9129.560000000001s)]
*  He fucking is the main reason [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9131.68s)]

*  when Don Lemon was talking to this lady [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9224.04s)]
*  about reparations for slavery? [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9226.04s)]
*  You ever see that thing? [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9227.92s)]
*  No. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9228.76s)]
*  Oh my God, please find this. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9229.6s)]
*  Don Lemon is talking to this British lady [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9231.2s)]
*  about reparations for slavery, [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9233.160000000002s)]

*  and you see Don Lemon's dumb ass like, [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9238.320000000002s)]
*  oh, very interesting. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9240.08s)]
*  Watch this. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9242.52s)]
*  No. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9243.58s)]
*  It's just, he was saying something that, you know, [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9244.82s)]
*  there should be reparations for slavery. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9248.82s)]
*  I think it's a political talking point at this point in time. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9250.380000000001s)]
*  I think there's people that still think [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9252.54s)]
*  that people today should get money [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9255.58s)]
*  because their ancestors were slaves. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9257.5s)]
*  I totally understand that argument. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9259.22s)]
*  However, with this lady saying, did you find it? [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9261.22s)]
*  It just has like a five second thing [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9264.82s)]
*  and then it talks about the whole. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9266.18s)]
*  But there's a video, I watched it yesterday. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9267.94s)]
*  No, I'm just saying I didn't have it [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9269.380000000001s)]
*  on that thing I'm looking for. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9271.34s)]
*  Okay, I bet on YouTube it's available. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9272.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Don Lemon for a smart guy seems like an idiot sometimes. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9276.14s)]
*  No, he's not. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9278.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's like for a guy who looks smart. [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9279.38s)]
*  There's other people reporting on it. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9281.34s)]
*  Okay, let's hear it though. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9283.42s)]
*  And then you have those who are asking [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9287.02s)]
*  for reparations for colonialism, [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9289.66s)]
*  and they're wondering, you know, $100 billion, [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9292.22s)]
*  $24 billion here and there, $500 million there. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9294.38s)]
*  Some people want to be paid back, [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9298.3s)]
*  and members of the public are wondering, [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9299.78s)]
*  why are we suffering when you are, [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9301.94s)]
*  you know, you have all of this vast wealth? [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9303.980000000001s)]
*  Those are legitimate concerns. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9305.58s)]
*  Well, I think you're right about reparations [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9308.18s)]
*  in terms of if people want it though, [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9309.980000000001s)]
*  what they need to do is you always need to go back [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9311.94s)]
*  to the beginning of a supply chain. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9313.82s)]
*  Where was the beginning of the supply chain? [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9315.58s)]
*  That was in Africa and when, across the entire world, [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9317.980000000001s)]
*  when slavery was taking place, [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9321.26s)]
*  which was the first nation in the world [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9322.94s)]
*  that abolished slavery? [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9324.62s)]
*  The first nation in the world to abolish it. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9326.54s)]
*  It was started by William Wilberforce, [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9328.380000000001s)]
*  who was the British. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9330.300000000001s)]
*  In Great Britain, they abolished slavery. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9331.380000000001s)]
*  2,000 naval men died on the high seas [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9333.78s)]
*  trying to stop slavery. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9337.74s)]
*  Why? [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9339.7s)]
*  Because the African kings were rounding up their own people. [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9340.54s)]
*  They had them on cages waiting in the beaches. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9343.26s)]
*  No one was running into Africa to get them. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9345.54s)]
*  And I think you're totally right. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9347.58s)]
*  If reparations need to be paid, [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9348.98s)]
*  we need to go right back to the beginning [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9350.74s)]
*  of that supply chain and say, [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9352.42s)]
*  who was rounding up their own people [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9354.06s)]
*  and having them handcuffed in cages? [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9355.78s)]
*  Absolutely, that's where they should start. [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9357.7s)]
*  And maybe, I don't know, the descendants of those families [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9360.9s)]
*  where they died in the high seas [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9363.02s)]
*  trying to stop the slavery, [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9365.02s)]
*  those families should receive something too, [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9366.380000000001s)]
*  I think, at the same time. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9368.54s)]
*  Look at that dumbass. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9369.980000000001s)]

*  He wasn't ready for that. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9386.74s)]
*  The producers in his ear, wrap it up, Don. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9387.58s)]
*  We're going to commercial, we're going to Pfizer. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9389.06s)]

*  Yeah, that's the dirty thing about it. [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9398.5s)]
*  It's like, people were monsters. [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9403.58s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9405.619999999999s)]
*  The Irish were slaves forever. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9406.46s)]
*  People were indentured servants. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9408.38s)]
*  They're brought over here. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9410.22s)]
*  People have been monsters forever. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9412.26s)]
*  And instead of doing that now, [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9414.14s)]
*  now they're picking fruit, picking lettuce, [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9416.42s)]
*  with no healthcare. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9420.42s)]
*  For two dollars. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9421.54s)]
*  Yeah, and we're shipping jobs over to there. [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9422.62s)]
*  So they work in these factories. [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9424.82s)]
*  They work 16 hours a day for a dollar an hour, [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9426.06s)]
*  or a dollar a day sometimes. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9428.78s)]
*  Joe, when I was in Abu Dhabi, [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9431.18s)]
*  one of the drivers who was taking us somewhere, [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9432.86s)]
*  he said he was happy. [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9434.62s)]
*  He was happy, because his family lives back in Lebanon [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9437.18s)]
*  or wherever they live, but he was happy [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9438.94s)]
*  because he just got a raise to like two dollars an hour. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9440.34s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9443.34s)]
*  From the dollar, but I mean, Joe, [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9444.18s)]
*  you'd have thought he was a millionaire now. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9447.1s)]
*  He was like, oh my God, like, it's like a 50 cent raise. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9448.82s)]
*  But he was like, the things I'll be able to do [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9451.82s)]
*  for my family back in Lebanon and all that stuff. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9453.1s)]
*  And it was like, holy shit. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9455.1s)]
*  Holy shit, yeah. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9457.86s)]
*  And then you're there and everything there [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9459.5s)]
*  is beautiful and pristine, [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9460.66s)]
*  and everything seems like the richest things in the world. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9461.9s)]
*  And they were really nice to us and it was awesome, [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9463.7s)]
*  because we were getting to do the rich things. [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9466.1s)]
*  But when you were talking to that guy, [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9467.94s)]
*  I vividly remember that conversation, [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9469.5s)]
*  because of how truly happy he was. [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9470.94s)]
*  He wasn't, in his head, he was like, this is great. [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9472.78s)]
*  His expectations were very low. [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9476.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9478.380000000001s)]
*  But that's the reality, [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9479.220000000001s)]
*  when people like Bernie Sanders talk about oligarchs. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9481.02s)]
*  If you're gonna have halves, like extreme halves, [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9483.74s)]
*  just by the nature of the world, you're gonna have have-nots. [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9487.62s)]
*  And the disparity between halves and have-nots [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9491.02s)]
*  is off the charts. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9493.62s)]
*  And it's probably only gonna get bigger. [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9495.18s)]
*  That's what's really kinda scary. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9497.58s)]
*  With AI and the ability to generate wealth, [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9499.94s)]
*  and what you're gonna be able to figure out and do, [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9505.1s)]
*  and the different ways that people are gonna be able [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9507.1s)]
*  to manipulate markets and dominate [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9509.02s)]
*  certain industries with AI, [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9511.74s)]
*  I think the have and have-nots, [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9514.220000000001s)]
*  and then you're gonna have also automation, [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9515.62s)]
*  which takes over everything. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9518.54s)]
*  So all these jobs. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9519.74s)]
*  Gone. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9521.060000000001s)]

*  I think they'll know, like, no, [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9530.66s)]
*  everyone has an automated car. [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9532.5s)]

*  Just drives itself. [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9542.74s)]
*  If you have a Tesla, [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9544.42s)]

*  I go, doot-doot, I press these buttons, [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9547.82s)]
*  and it just takes off. [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9549.859999999999s)]
*  It stops at red lights, it changes lanes, [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9551.14s)]
*  it, like, slows down when the traffic slows down, [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9554.3s)]
*  speeds up when the traffic speeds up. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9556.46s)]

*  Like elephant tusks are made out of ivory. [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9909.380000000001s)]
*  And ivory is very valuable. [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9911.7s)]

*  for this one thing that's a commodity and it's fucked up. [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9931.86s)]

*  It looks like it's from the dinosaur days. [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9951.94s)]
*  I read this thing yesterday about, [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9954.18s)]
*  you ever heard the bear that's called the boss? [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9955.14s)]
*  Oh yeah, that one bear that's, [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9957.86s)]
*  he's got like thousands of kids. [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9959.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he got hit by a train. [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9960.74s)]
*  Twice. [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9963.02s)]
*  That means he got hit by a train and was like running back. [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9964.42s)]
*  Running back you bitch ass train. [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9966.94s)]
*  I'm gonna knock this motherfucker off the tracks this time. [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9968.380000000001s)]
*  He got hit by a train twice, has all the cubs, [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9970.74s)]
*  and apparently eats other bears sometimes [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9972.78s)]
*  just to let the mother remind people. [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9974.26s)]
*  Cause he's so old that people, the young bears try him. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9975.42s)]
*  So I read he eats them sometimes [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9977.82s)]
*  just to be like I gotta let everybody know. [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9979.300000000001s)]
*  Bears eat bears. [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9980.78s)]
*  That's real common. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9982.02s)]
*  Yeah they eat cubs. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9983.18s)]
*  It's real dark. [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9984.34s)]
*  A friend of mine saw it. [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9985.980000000001s)]
*  He saw, my friend Jonathan up in Alberta, [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9987.5s)]
*  he saw a bear and the sow and the boar were fighting. [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9990.62s)]
*  So males the boar, females the sow. [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9996.3s)]
*  They were fighting because the male [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=9998.74s)]
*  was trying to kill the cubs. [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10001.5s)]
*  And so the female's trying to fight him off. [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10002.66s)]
*  And eventually she can't fight him off [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10004.42s)]
*  and he gets ahold of one of the cubs and kills it. [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10006.26s)]
*  And then she scares him off of the cub that he killed. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10008.94s)]
*  And then she eats the cub. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10012.46s)]
*  She eats her own cub. [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10015.1s)]
*  Once it's dead she's like I'll just eat it. [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10016.7s)]
*  Why do you think? [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10018.74s)]
*  It's food. [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10019.74s)]
*  It's like fucking. [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10020.58s)]
*  Once it's dead it's just food. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10021.42s)]
*  Bro. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10024.18s)]
*  That's fucked up. [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10025.02s)]
*  You think two dollars an hour is hard life. [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10025.86s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10028.82s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10029.66s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10030.5s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10031.34s)]
*  The bears is shitting on ghettos. [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10032.18s)]
*  Like you think it's hard. [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10034.26s)]
*  You think it's hard. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10035.26s)]
*  I go outside every day thinking I'm gonna get eaten. [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10036.1s)]
*  Dealing with the boss bear. [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10038.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10039.98s)]
*  Well that's what happens also when you have, [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10040.82s)]
*  that's how nature balances out ecosystems, right? [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10042.26s)]
*  Because if there's no natural predators for bears, [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10044.66s)]
*  they have to eat themselves. [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10047.86s)]
*  Just as nothing can eat a grizzly bear. [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10051.42s)]
*  They have to eat each other. [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10053.46s)]
*  That's the only way they keep the population. [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10054.539999999999s)]
*  To keep it. [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10056.1s)]
*  So there's still some salmon [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10056.94s)]
*  and some other things left for everybody else. [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10057.78s)]
*  So when cubs are born, there's two things that happen. [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10059.22s)]
*  One, well there's three things. [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10062.34s)]
*  One, the male thinks of them as food. [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10064.42s)]
*  So he wants to kill them for food. [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10066.5s)]
*  Like they hunt them. [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10067.78s)]
*  They go into the dens. [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10068.619999999999s)]
*  When the males come out of hibernation early, [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10069.699999999999s)]
*  they go into dens to look for cubs to eat them. [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10071.619999999999s)]
*  They know they do that for food. [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10073.86s)]
*  Two, they try to bring the female into estrus again. [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10075.78s)]
*  So if they can kill the cubs, [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10079.060000000001s)]
*  then the female will want to breed [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10080.54s)]
*  so she can have more cubs. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10081.86s)]
*  And so it'll get the female [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10083.86s)]
*  so that she'll want to breed again. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10086.220000000001s)]
*  And then three is competition. [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10087.54s)]
*  They look at those cubs as potential future competition. [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10089.62s)]
*  So it's all these horrible ways. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10093.42s)]
*  It's this beautiful nature. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10095.94s)]
*  Nature's amazing. [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10097.74s)]
*  Nature is a fucking bloodbath. [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10099.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10101.300000000001s)]
*  It's a bloodbath. [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10102.140000000001s)]
*  Even the grass is screaming. [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10104.62s)]
*  They found out that grass screams now. [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10106.740000000002s)]
*  Plants make noise when you're eating them. [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10110.300000000001s)]
*  No. [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10112.1s)]
*  They just can't move. [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10112.94s)]
*  That's too much. [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10115.02s)]
*  No. [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10115.86s)]
*  That is, the fact that we are the apex, [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10118.7s)]
*  because you were saying something yesterday, [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10121.02s)]
*  we were talking and we were saying how like, [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10121.980000000001s)]
*  it's crazy to think that aliens [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10123.300000000001s)]
*  wouldn't think we're interesting. [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10124.660000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's that dumb argument that I had [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10125.86s)]
*  with Neil deGrasse Tyson. [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10127.300000000001s)]
*  Like, what are you saying? [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10128.300000000001s)]
*  Because when you think about like, [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10129.58s)]
*  man, we are the top dog on this planet. [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10130.42s)]
*  That's interesting in itself. [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10132.7s)]
*  It's different than everything else here. [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10134.66s)]
*  If you're gonna study anything, [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10135.859999999999s)]
*  anywhere in the fucking universe, [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10137.14s)]

*  And they're soft. [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10152.019999999999s)]
*  We can easily be killed. [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10152.859999999999s)]
*  Easily. [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY&t=10153.699999999999s)]
