# Joe Rogan Experience #1450 - Brian Redban
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 31, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS3te7kM6DY)
*  Yee-haw!
*  How you hanging in there, fella? Great, man.
*  I think these things are gonna annoy a lot of people.
*  If you're listening, we're wearing aluminum foil.
*  We're wearing space suits.
*  God, they're so crunchy. There's not many left for me to get.
*  This is dope. Now I'm getting into the... Yeah.
*  This is my favorite one.
*  I like the orange one for some strange reason.
*  The white one just seems like I'm a clean-up person.
*  You know? Like you're doing some NASA clean-up.
*  Like there's alien bodies you're trying to get rid of.
*  But this feels like we're about to do something special.
*  Yeah. We're protected.
*  Yeah. I just hope it doesn't start making us sweat
*  and we lose like 100 pounds.
*  This is the same shit that's on the outside of the lunar module.
*  You remember that cheap-looking aluminum foil?
*  Oh, yeah. Looks like it was stuck on there with gum.
*  Heat shield? Yeah, the heat shield.
*  Whatever it is. Yeah.
*  What are that fucking fake stuff is?
*  Or the alien? You ever see the alien
*  where he had to put that big sheet that was made out of this material at the very end?
*  You ever see that movie?
*  Was it Predator or Alien?
*  No. The one with Matt Damon and he's like lost in space.
*  The Martian. Oh, the Martian. Jesus.
*  Oh, yeah. Well, they have these for people that get like lost hiking.
*  Like they're blankets. They'll keep you alive.
*  You won't be cozy, but they'll keep you alive.
*  They're like these real thin aluminum foil-looking blankets.
*  I guess they just retain heat pretty good.
*  Pretty good. You know, like you're not getting a good night's sleep,
*  but you might stay alive.
*  Yeah. How are you holding up?
*  I'm all right. Yeah.
*  Yeah. You know, look, these people that got it rough,
*  the people that got it rough are, number one, medical workers.
*  Anybody, you know, much love to anybody that's working in hospitals right now.
*  Doctors, nurses, everybody, interns, everybody, everybody.
*  People working the desk. God damn, you guys have it rough.
*  You know, those are the people, number one.
*  Number two, anybody in the hospitality industry, people serving food, restaurants, bars.
*  Grocery store workers. Jesus.
*  Yeah, they have it rough, but they have jobs.
*  You know, it's rough, but their jobs are still open.
*  The thing that drives me crazy is there's so many restaurants
*  where these people, you know, employed 50, 60 people.
*  And, you know, restaurants are hard.
*  It's hard to stay open when things are great.
*  You know, restaurants are fucking, but what is it?
*  It's one of the number one businesses that fails.
*  Like, what is the, see if you could find a statistic, but it's something crazy.
*  Like 70% of all restaurants fail within the first year.
*  Because it's just fucking hard. Imagine running a restaurant.
*  Especially what kind, like a chicken restaurant.
*  Everyone has chicken restaurants.
*  Do you remember that great restaurant that was right next to the Ice House?
*  We used to go there all the time.
*  Yeah, it's gone now. We got a fog bra there.
*  Oh, it was good.
*  And the place that just replaced it just closed down.
*  Look at this. They have a high failure rate, but knowing why can help the prospective owners.
*  Around 60% of new restaurants fail within the first year,
*  and nearly 80% shutter before their fifth anniversary.
*  Wow. 80% in five years.
*  So if you get a restaurant like Dan Tanna's that's been open since like the 60s or something.
*  Like when is, you ever eat at Dan Tanna's, Jamie?
*  Have you ever eaten there?
*  Where's that?
*  You don't know where Dan Tanna's is?
*  Oh my God, dude, we need to do a dinner at Dan Tanna's.
*  Anytime.
*  A post store dinner at Dan Tanna's because Dan Tanna's is open.
*  The kitchen's open until like midnight.
*  It's phenomenal. Some of the best Italian food in all of LA.
*  And it's on Santa Monica Boulevard, like on the border of Boys Town.
*  Wow.
*  It's next to the Troubadour, right?
*  Hey, yeah.
*  The Troubadour where I saw Everlast recently and Sturgill.
*  Sturgill Simpson played the Troubadour too.
*  Stoubadour's dope.
*  I hope Everlast is doing okay with his daughter.
*  His daughter has, you know.
*  He's being real smart, staying the fuck away from everybody.
*  They're a hold up and everybody's healthy.
*  Last I spoke to him.
*  Yeah, there it is. Dan Tanna's.
*  Bro, that place is the shit.
*  They have phenomenal pasta.
*  They have excellent steaks.
*  It's a really good old school restaurant.
*  You go in there like it looks like they haven't done shit to that place since 1970.
*  Everything's perfect.
*  Like that. That's what it looks like inside.
*  I have seen the place.
*  It's amazing. Dude, it's so good.
*  It's so good.
*  I love that old school Italian look.
*  You know, with like the red tablecloth.
*  I ate there with Suzanne.
*  Suzanne and I went to see Sturgill.
*  And then afterwards we ate at Dan Tanna's.
*  I was like, dude, I feel like we're real Hollywood.
*  She got hold up.
*  You know, Suzanne from Honey Honey.
*  She got hold up in North Carolina.
*  Oh, gosh.
*  Yeah, you know, her folks are down there.
*  So she went down there and she's hold up.
*  I know so many people are hold up.
*  Nick Swartz and he's hold up in Michigan.
*  You know, or Minnesota rather where he's from.
*  You know, one of them M words.
*  Right.
*  One of them cold places.
*  Yeah, my friend David.
*  Yeah, he's Minnesota.
*  Kiltoni.
*  He was stuck in New York and he got out like the day before they just banned it.
*  Like all travel out of New York.
*  But now no hanging out with David for a little bit.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Even 14 days.
*  Hey, man, can I take your temperature?
*  Jamie's got somebody in his building.
*  Yeah, got an email yesterday.
*  I was going to say they have a checkpoints.
*  They're showing videos of in Florida blocking people coming in from like New York.
*  Yeah.
*  So many people flew down there to bail and they brought that shit down there.
*  Yeah, there was reading an article.
*  I think it was in the Atlantic about people who are on the Cape Cape Cod and Boston.
*  Like Cape Cod and Boston and they're mad that people who own summer houses out there
*  are going to stay in their summer house.
*  Like, hey, you fuck.
*  This is where we live.
*  Don't bring your cooties over here.
*  Yeah, but they live there too, man.
*  They just they own two houses.
*  They still own the house.
*  You know, just if you own two houses.
*  How does that work?
*  You know, like people want their isolation, right?
*  Because they live in their town.
*  But if somebody bought that house, this is still America.
*  That's their fucking house.
*  Yeah, I get it.
*  You don't want a bunch of people coughing around you, but they don't want a bunch of people coughing around them either,
*  which is why they went to the Cape in the first place.
*  Just everyone scared.
*  Burbank had two cases.
*  And then yesterday, a retirement home right next to my house, somebody got it and gave it to like 17 people.
*  So we just went up like a ton in Burbank.
*  It just makes me wonder if like any of those people went to my grocery store, because now I'm thinking about that.
*  Now I'm like overthinking like I got to the overthink where like now I'm thinking about Postmates.
*  I Postmates so much.
*  What if the driver sneezes on my food or Amazon box like the cardboard box?
*  What if the yeah, you got to think of you Postmate that guy's going all over the place.
*  Right. They have to.
*  Yeah.
*  And I have to.
*  And I doubt Postmates is giving them like spray and gloves and all that.
*  This is like the craziest way to try to stop something from spreading in massive cities where everybody travels, where everybody's connected to everybody.
*  So even when you have everybody on lockdown, it just it's like you got fingers in the dike, you know, like trying to hold up the holes in the dam.
*  But water still squirting through for sure.
*  It's not like you open up the whole dam.
*  But you got to think of all the different people that have to work just hospital workers, them alone, man.
*  They have to work.
*  The other thing I was reading in Atlantic is another I've been reading Atlantic lately, apparently.
*  Another another article was they were talking about these doctors that can't even test people.
*  They can't use the test on them unless they meet certain criteria.
*  And the doctor was like, he said, when these people come, they have a fever, they're they're coughing.
*  And if they didn't have coronavirus before they got here, they probably do now.
*  I was like, oh, my God.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  And we're not even to the supposedly the middle part of all this.
*  Yeah. And it's also like whose fault is it?
*  Is it anybody's fault?
*  It seems like no one has any idea what's going on.
*  And to blame anybody.
*  Definitely bad decisions were made.
*  Whoever ate the first bat, Ozzie, whoever did it.
*  I've been eating bats for a long time.
*  They're just like the Bee Gees down there trying to stay alive.
*  I read an article about they said the lady who was patient zero that got it first, she thinks she got it from being in a stall next to it somehow.
*  She didn't say she ate like a bat.
*  Oh, she was in that market and like she was selling something else in there and like being near it.
*  Oh, man, she's breathing bat air all day.
*  20 other people got up to around her.
*  Oh, that's what the next mission I read.
*  I don't know how true that was.
*  Should we like is there any reason for a bat to be a species still like can't we just wipe out bats?
*  Well, they were talking about doing that with mosquitoes.
*  But when you play God with an ecosystem, you don't know what the unintended consequences are.
*  There's some good examples of that.
*  Like you can't just do that.
*  Like even bring in a new species to a place where there's you know, it seems like the species is going to be fine.
*  Has disastrous results most of the time.
*  But does it's not a part of the system like it's weird, man, like systems.
*  They they're they exist in nature and there's like all these strengths and weaknesses that balance each other out.
*  These animals that eat other animals and those animals animals eat certain plants and those certain plants.
*  They shit those plants out and helps fertilize other plants and they got it down.
*  They know what they're doing and you throw a buffalo into that and everybody's like everything gets fucked up.
*  I mean, that's that's what happened to Australia.
*  Australia, you know, Australia and New Zealand are both crazy examples of that.
*  Australia in particular, because so many people live there.
*  I mean, as many almost as many people as live in L.A. live in Australia, which doesn't seem like a lot.
*  Isn't Australia like they're not letting anyone leave?
*  Yeah, I think they got it. I don't know. Is that true?
*  I thought I read that they were probably should.
*  But anyway, Australia has wild cats like house cats that they put out to kill some other thing that they put out to live over.
*  They did a bunch of stupid shit like that. Like they have all these animals just roaming around.
*  They have to kill them. They have to chase them down and kill them.
*  All these deer and all these different stags and these different animals.
*  They sometimes they have to do with helicopters.
*  They fly over and just gun them down because they don't have any predators.
*  So these things just get to these preposterous proportions.
*  Look at Japanese beetles. You know, they came from Japan and they they fuck up our country.
*  What? Every seven years they come in town and just you guys ever have beetles in L.A.?
*  I don't know. Like where you have to get those beetle bags.
*  Well, they get those bark beetles that fucked up big bear.
*  Yeah, those bark beetles. They kill all the trees.
*  They kill a certain large number of those trees.
*  And because we're scared of fire for good reasons, we never let fires happen.
*  So those trees in nature, they're supposed to burn down and it's supposed to like everything's supposed to recover.
*  And the burn actually helps the trees grow.
*  You know, again, it's a system that's been in place for a million years.
*  But we're we're like we're better than this. We're smarter.
*  We know what we're going to do. We're just going to ask some beetles got over there on a boat.
*  Who gives a shit? Some plants got in someone's boot.
*  The seeds were in the cracks of someone's boot and wound up in the forest in this new invasive species
*  cropped up and chokes out all the native plants.
*  It happens all the time. What's that stuff that's in the south?
*  We talked about it one time. It covers everything.
*  Some crazy growth that I believe it's from Asia originally.
*  And it made it down. Someone was explaining it to me.
*  And I remember I was blown away because I'd never heard about a mold.
*  They can. No, it's like a like a vine that covers everything.
*  It's like trees that cover other trees.
*  They choke out all the life. They take away all the oxygen and sun.
*  Oxygen trees don't even breathe oxygen.
*  What am I talking about? Yeah, that's the stuff.
*  Pull up a picture of that shit. Takes over a whole forest.
*  Yeah, it's weird. I never even heard about it until like three or four years ago.
*  Someone on the podcast brought it up and I was like, what?
*  What is this? Look at that. Dude, that's just that stuff just takes over.
*  So it's growing over trees. Grows over everything.
*  Wow, that's like looks like ghosts. Yeah, it's like it's like an alien thing
*  that decides it's going to like overcome everything in its environment
*  and completely take over other trees. At least it looks okay.
*  It looks dope. It looks dope. But it's weird, dude.
*  It's things like that are weird because if that was an animal doing that
*  to other animals, we'd be freaked out.
*  If we like let these rats loose and the rats were like chasing down,
*  you know, people's cows and killing all these people's cows,
*  we'd be like, what the fuck is going on?
*  Oh, these rats just live around cows and consume them.
*  But we see trees getting consumed.
*  Like if you've never seen these photos, the stuff's spelled K-U-D-Z-U.
*  And it's that was was that in the Mississippi was that the photo was from?
*  The last photo? Yeah, I think so.
*  Somewhere in the south. And I don't know when this shit see if you could find
*  the history when it was introduced. Oh, it's in Portland, Oregon, too.
*  Well, that name sounds like it's it came from Asia, like Caduceus.
*  Yeah, Japanese. Yeah. Damn.
*  Yeah, when was it brought over here?
*  That stuff is just dominating wherever it is.
*  It's weird. It's when especially when something like this is going on,
*  like we're dealing with coronavirus and you stop and think about the things
*  that get 1876 centennial exposition in Philadelphia.
*  That's when Kuzu was introduced from Japan at the United States
*  at the Japanese Pavilion. 1876.
*  So from 1876, that shit took the fuck off.
*  Is there anything you could do like eat it or smoke it?
*  I don't know. Good question.
*  That picture that Jamie had the last picture about Portland was talking
*  about an eradication. They're trying to eradicate it.
*  But how do you eradicate all that stuff? There's so much of it.
*  You just camo to cover up tanks and shit in World War II.
*  That makes sense. Yeah. Oh, my God. You'd hide in that stuff.
*  Perfect. You never be able to see what the fuck anything is.
*  There we go. Yeah. You can kind of eat it.
*  It says it contains the starch and the flour. It can be made into a jelly.
*  Whoa. It's been used as a food ingredient in East Asia, in Vietnam.
*  The starch called, say that, bach san day. What do you think?
*  Bach san day. It's flavored with pomelo and then used as a drink in the summer.
*  Huh. Yeah. There you go.
*  But it's a life form that's killing another life form, taking over
*  massive swaths of land. And it makes me think about this coronavirus.
*  That's another different... I mean, it's not a life form. It's a virus, technically.
*  But it's obviously a thing that grows and wants life and kills and consumes bodies
*  and takes over. And it's so easy to get past, I guess.
*  People are talking about how if you let somebody pet your dog, like if you're
*  holding your dog and somebody goes, oh no, and pets your dog.
*  And it stays on the dog. And then it's on your dog.
*  Jesus Christ. Or like these jewels. You put your jewel down on a table.
*  You don't even think about it. And then you put it right in your mouth.
*  You called it a dirty straw the other day. Exactly. You're just holding a dirty straw.
*  You have that dirty straw in your pocket all the time. It's always rubbing up
*  against your lint and your gum. Yeah. Luckily, these things, the ends are
*  replaceable. So you're kind of... Just throw it away every five minutes.
*  You should have a giant gym bag of them.
*  My girlfriend just got one of those phone cleaners where you put your phone in
*  and it has the UV lights. So now I'm putting everything in. I'm putting jewels,
*  car keys. It's a good move. It's a good move. I had heard about those before.
*  I didn't know there was a thing that I found out about called a Stere-Stik.
*  And they use it when they go back country hiking and stuff and camping.
*  And it purifies water with a stick. Like it's an electrolyte band.
*  And you stick it in into this UV light and you stick it into this...
*  It's like a straw looking thing. A life straw. Yeah, like a lightsaber.
*  Remember those kids' lightsabers? That's what it looks like with the clear on the
*  outside. And you just spit. See if you can find one of those fucking things.
*  I wouldn't trust that. And apparently the light kills all the bacteria.
*  But it doesn't filter the taste. It still tastes like donkey piss.
*  Yeah, you still get little grits of... Yeah. I mean, if you get lucky, you get a
*  clean stream. You just run that through it and it doesn't alter the taste of the
*  water, which is nice. I don't know how it's working. Yeah, there's other ones.
*  The life straws where you can just sit there and drink urine through a straw and
*  it cleans it. Now, I would trust that more than just a light.
*  Well, those get clogged up, man. And sometimes they leak. Sometimes people get
*  Giardia from those filters. They don't clean them good enough. And they get clogged
*  up with poo, which is what Giardia is. You're basically getting a disease that
*  comes out of gopher shit. They call it beaver fever. Yeah.
*  I wonder if this corona is going to kill joint circles because now that seems
*  insane. Just go out in the back of the comic store with 20 dirty comics.
*  Yeah, there it is. So that fucking thing, that little lightsaber thing,
*  SteriStick, that can... What does it say as far as how quick it does it?
*  This is an article about this versus that straw.
*  SteriPen, a small pen-like electronic device that emits an ultraviolet light
*  and purifies either half a liter or one full liter of water at a time.
*  The device operates on batteries and works with cleaning water by killing the
*  DNA of harmful microbes and bacteria. What? How weird is that?
*  I wonder how long it takes though because I know the phone cleaner takes like 10
*  minutes. One minute. One minute later? That doesn't seem right.
*  So once the water is safe to drink, about one minute later the light turns off
*  and flashes green. One minute? That's insane.
*  I wonder if they tested it. They should test it.
*  Yeah, you drink it, bitch. I remember there was this one executive and he was
*  talking about how safe glyphosate is that's round up, that stuff that they're
*  now proving causes cancer. Proving. And lawsuits have been settled and it's not
*  good for you to consume. And this guy had a glass of it. He's like, you could drink
*  it. And so the guy's like, go ahead, drink it. He wouldn't drink it.
*  He's like, you could drink it. He brought a glass of it. Like, bitch, drink it.
*  Did you see the guy that they just arrested for selling the coronavirus pill
*  that supposedly kills the coronavirus? He reminds me of that old bodybuilding guy.
*  What's that? Dan or whatever that used to sell fake...
*  Oh, one in the back of the book, guys? Yeah. But if you look at this guy, he looks
*  like he's selling... Well, there was some preachers that were selling it.
*  Like Jim Baker was selling a coronavirus cure.
*  They straight up arrested this guy, though. He looks like a meathead.
*  What? They say there's nothing... The chloroquine, there's no studies, right?
*  There's no definitive tests, but they're still letting people try it. Is that
*  what's going on with that? I think so. The couple that died took the wrong shit.
*  Yeah, they took poison. They took algae, or bacteria killer.
*  It's for fucking koi ponds. It's poison. They took poison. They died from taking poison.
*  They misread or misunderstood or something. Dude, the media today is kind of spooky.
*  The hatred of Trump is getting in the way of the accuracy of some people's
*  reporting of the news, and that's a perfect example. By resorting to clickbait
*  and saying that they heard it from Trump. But that's not what he said.
*  What he's talking about is a different kind of chloroquine. There's more than one
*  different kind of it, right? Right. But if they just said, real simply, that these
*  people died, please be careful. There is more than one different kind of chloroquine,
*  and chloroquine hasn't been shown definitively to work yet, and it's not
*  necessarily safe to take. If they said that, that would be great, but instead
*  they had to say the president told people to take it. But that's not what he said.
*  What he said is that there's hope, and we're hoping that this could be a cure,
*  or this could be a treatment. That's what he said. But that's what everybody's saying.
*  Like if you go and read articles about that when doctors are talking about
*  potential treatments, there's a bunch of different ones. There's IV, vitamin C,
*  there's chloroquine. So this chloroquine, which is like an old school malaria
*  medication, and then Z-packs, they're talking about, what is that called?
*  Zethromythosine? How do you say that? I don't know. But that antibiotic, they're saying
*  that that may have some effect. But these are made. That's what they're saying.
*  It's people who are scrambling for an answer, who are trying to help people not sure
*  if this is definitely going to work or not going to work, but it shows some promise.
*  That's what Trump talked about. You can't give them a hard time for talking about
*  what doctors are talking about, because legitimate people are talking about that
*  combination of things. Just because you hate Trump, you can't distort this and
*  make it seem like Trump did something irresponsible by talking about this
*  hopeful disease medication, and these people took the wrong version of it and
*  died. It's a cautionary tale. It's not a chance to shit on Trump. But everything's
*  a chance to shit on Trump. It's so exhausting. It's just, it's fucking weird, man.
*  Well, have you seen his ratings? It's silly. He's silly. There's no doubt he does
*  silly shit. But he's gotten a lot better at handling confrontational conversations
*  with reporters. I was watching this one yesterday, and this reporter was asking
*  him questions. She asked him about a few things, but she asked about people dying
*  because of the economy failing, and him talking about, like, is there anyone that
*  could speak to this? She says, it's, she's playing a game, right? The game is she
*  knows there's no real data that shows if they do that, this will happen. If the
*  economy crashes the way they anticipated crashing, and all these people are out of
*  work for an extended period of time, X amount of people will kill themselves. But
*  we for sure know that economic despair is a reason why some people go into
*  depression. Depression is a reason why some people kill themselves. These are all
*  facts that we all know. Like, maybe you can't pull that out of your ass when
*  you're standing in front of a podium, and you're addressing people, and they're
*  calling you out on this. And what she was saying correctly is we can't put money
*  ahead of people's lives. So the correct thing by most people's account is for at
*  least some period of time separating everybody, maintaining this distance, and
*  putting a stop to the number of diseases, you know, viruses or number of people to
*  get infected. But what he's saying is there's also a factor that we have to
*  consider, that all these people out of work could lead to suicide, it could lead to
*  drug addiction. And he's right, and you know he's right. We all know he's right.
*  That's not, that's irrefutable. When people's lives fall apart through the
*  unexpected circumstances, some people are hanging on by a fucking thread, and that
*  comes along and it doesn't end. That does happen to people. We all know that to be
*  true. Just because you hate Trump, you can't pretend that this isn't going to be
*  rough for people, or you can't pretend that him saying that this can cause a loss
*  of life too. I think the problem might have been he might have said maybe more
*  life. There's no evidence of that. That's true. There's no evidence that it might
*  cause more loss of life. I think also we grew up always listening at a state
*  at a stressful time when the president came on, you felt comforted, like his tone
*  of voice, how he acted, you always kind of felt safer. And I think when it comes to
*  Trump, you're just like, ay, ay, fuck you, and this kind of shit. Get out of here.
*  That's the worst Trump impression ever. Ay, ay, fuck you. He does kind of remind me of
*  like a New Yorker, a New Jersey guy, like get this good guy, you know, cocksucka.
*  Well, I mean, he kind of is. He's a New York real estate mogul. You know, you have to
*  have a certain amount of that to thrive in New York City. New York people are a
*  unique breed. Who got hit harder than them? They've already lost more than a thousand
*  people as of this morning. That place has got it bad because they're all stacked on
*  top of each other. It's one of the things, unfortunately, that makes New York
*  awesome. New York, you're just immersed. You're immersed in people. You walk down
*  the street in New York and there's fucking people are everywhere, man. They're coming
*  at you. You're coming at them. It's wild. It's a different kind of way of living.
*  I get it. All the people that love it, you know, my friend Jeff, he's lived there
*  forever since I met him. He's my manager. And he fucking loves it. Loves New York.
*  Just loves it. Loves knowing all the good spots, you know, loves knowing how to get
*  around the subway. He doesn't even need a man. He loves it. He loves it. I go there,
*  I'm like, Jesus Christ. I just go and I go, wah, whoo, and let me jump off that ride.
*  That's how I feel about New York. But it's great. It's great. And I get it that you would
*  want to live there. I get it. Especially like creative types. But Judah Friedlander was
*  telling us, it's like all bankers now. He goes, it's so fucking expensive to live in
*  Manhattan. It's not like this giant artist community anymore. Everybody's sort of been
*  pushed out to Brooklyn and pushed out to the other boroughs. It's so expensive. I looked up
*  somebody, like a celebrity, accidentally put out his address the other day and I was like,
*  oh, I want to know what he lives. He lives in that little two bedroom apartment. $3.7
*  million. And I was just like, what? That's so crazy. Yeah, he's been blogging from it
*  and it just looks like a basic apartment. 40 minutes out of Nashville, 2.7, 3.7, is that
*  what you said? How much? 3.7. $3.7 million. We'll buy you a goddamn farm. You could have
*  a giant ass farm with like 400 acres of land and a beautiful house with a view. Maybe you
*  have a creek in your backyard. That's what you get for $3.7 million. You're not supposed
*  to get a fucking apartment. No. Basic apartment. It's in that Chelsea district. Is that a good
*  spot? I guess. I don't know anything about New York. Yeah, I know that one spot that
*  was really good that everybody's trying to convince me I should move to flooded. What's
*  that one spot down in the base of New York? What's that one place where they all love
*  it? Financial district down there? Yeah, there's like a, but there's an area down there that's
*  like real ritzy. Meatpacking district? Yeah, but they don't call it that. It's got another
*  name. Hell's Kitchen? No, no, no. Okay, I don't know. Is that Chelsea? No, it's not that.
*  I know people in New York are screaming right now. I'll remember later, but it flooded like
*  real bad. Like my friend's elevator had seven feet of water in it. Yeah, like your lobby,
*  you go into the lobby, it was filled with water. It starts with a T. God damn it. It's
*  driving me crazy. Tristina. Fuck! Tribeca? Yes! Thank you. Oh my God. It's all in the
*  same area. It's pretty close. I barely made it through. So we went there to visit once
*  back in the Dizze when my older daughter was going to college and when we drove around
*  to see what it would be like to live in New York, we were like, you guys are high. You
*  can't even park. There's nowhere to park. If you want to park in a spot, it costs you
*  like $2,000 a month. That's kind of it. Maybe if you don't like cars, you'd like New York
*  better. But if you have a car... Yeah. Well, there's freedom that we have. There's a freedom
*  of just being able to get in your car and just drive down to a deli at one in the morning
*  and park and get out with your friends. There's that freedom that you have to just go wherever
*  you want with cars. Once you get used to that and you get used to not being on top of people
*  like the subway, you get spoiled. You get spoiled. But there's a benefit to being on
*  top of people too. New York is way more diverse in terms of the way people interact with each
*  other. Rich people are walking out of the street with poor people who are walking up
*  the street. Everybody's together. There's no everybody together in LA. There's no time
*  where everybody just intermingles. It's like people stay in their neighborhoods or they
*  go out to bars and restaurants and they go back to their neighborhoods. They're not walking
*  past each other for prolonged periods of time to and from work, in the neighborhood, going
*  from place to place, just walking around. It's kind of ironic that the most urban place
*  is the place where the people walk the most. Kind of ironic, right? I mean, any place that's
*  less urban, everybody just drives everywhere because it's easier to just get in your car
*  and drive somewhere. But there, it's so hard to park. Everybody just walks. Imagine if
*  everybody in New York had a car. That would be the most ridiculous thing ever. You actually
*  couldn't do it, right? How many million people are in New York? In Manhattan. Just
*  Manhattan. That live there? Yeah. What do you think? Seven? No, it's less than that because
*  Brooklyn's way bigger. Really? Yeah. I mean, most people are driving into the city to work
*  for the day when they leave. Let's take a bet. I bet it's more than that. I bet it's
*  five. At least five. I just heard a discussion about it the other day. Oh, would you hear
*  it on? Like some guy's talking about how Brooklyn, if it was on its own, not part of the boroughs,
*  it would be like the fifth largest city in the country. Is this guy just someone hanging
*  out with you? No, no, no. There's a podcast discussion. Oh, live in New York. That's the
*  problem. I heard this. I heard shit. Let's Google it. I say five million. What do you
*  say? Three point seven. Oh, it's a good head. Your bet move. And you say two. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Full time residents. Wow. Holy shit. That doesn't seem right. It's not that big. Manhattan.
*  Manhattan. Like the borough or all of New York City. No, just Manhattan. Just Manhattan.
*  Yeah. I bet it's bigger than that. So it's like a Burbank at night. Everyone leaves. There's
*  no one actually lives there. There's no way it's a million. There's so many people that
*  live there. One point six. Wow. Oh my God. That's bonkers. Does that in the 30s?
*  Twenty twenty. Nineteen thirties. One point six. And how many visit there to work every
*  day? That's that's got to be fucking stupendous. What do you guess? Every day. Three point
*  seven. I'm saying five. Five million visitors. How many? Sixty five point two million tourists
*  in a year. Oh, but that's tourists. I mean, commuters. Yeah. How many people do you think
*  commute there every day? Three point seven. It's a it's an interesting life, man. And
*  those people that love it when they go somewhere else. One point six to three point one commute
*  every day. So it doubles. Oh, that's it, huh? Three point one. Wow. I would have guessed
*  it would be I would have guessed that Manhattan was like seven million people. What is like
*  the whole of New York City? All the boroughs together? It's like close to like ten or eleven
*  twelve when you get everything all together. But Manhattan itself is a yeah. What's a lot
*  of fucking rich people. See some of the places that are for sale in Manhattan. I don't know
*  what happened, but I got on a YouTube thing where I started watching these ridiculous
*  apartment buildings in New York City that they build where they build them specifically
*  for like, you know, some crazy Arab oil dude who's got a shit ton of money, wants the dopest
*  fucking house on the planet Earth or some hedge fund guy who's about to get busted before
*  he wants to go out with a bang. Right. Spend all his money. But they have elevators and
*  fucking theaters and huge home spas. And they have some of them actually have garages. You
*  can actually park in a garage in New York City and they show us like the crowning jewel
*  of this building, a garage. You actually can park your car in New York City. I'm like,
*  wow, what is what is wrong? What did you do? Yeah. It's weird being on Facebook. My friend's
*  a realtor and he'll just post like, oh, here, here's a eight bedroom unit in Texas. Two
*  hundred thousand dollars. And you're just looking at like that Scarface's house. Like
*  I want to buy that. Yeah, you'd have to if you lived in Texas, would you go Austin? There's
*  two moves. No, there's three moves, really. There's Austin. If you're like, you know,
*  I want a hand tattoo. Yeah, I love I love craft beer. And I like I like going to see
*  live bands or your Houston, where it's like you really love oil money or Dallas. I would
*  definitely not do Houston because of the weather. Too funky. Yeah, it's too humid. Summer gets
*  hot and it's too much drown like flooding lately. It's the right controller. Like my
*  ex girlfriend's house, her parents house got flooded like four times. They rebuilt it and
*  then it got flood rebuilt it. One time when we were we were at the laugh stop and after
*  we left, the entire city went underwater. Yeah, like the hotel where we were staying
*  at doesn't exist anymore because it went underwater. Yeah. Dallas is the move. I think it's the
*  last stop. Yeah, Dallas is my favorite because you could always drive to Austin and then
*  you can get out before anybody just annoys you. Dallas is pretty close to Los Angeles.
*  It's got a lot of money and it's very rich. And so everywhere you go, it feels very LA
*  and they have less healers per capita. Yeah. You know what I mean? I don't get me wrong.
*  I fucking love Austin. I love Austin. But there's there's a high percentage of knuckleheads
*  that are like wrapped up in the spiritual sort of aspects of nonsense. Takes one rock
*  store to ruin that though. Oh my God. One person who's a channeler was doing seances
*  at their house. Do you think their business is picking up right now? No, protecting people.
*  No, people need money. People need money. They're not going to spend their fucking money
*  on some nonsense. In the back of their head, they know it was nonsense. You're hearing
*  way, way, way, way, way less people complain about nonsense right now. You know, you don't
*  hear the standard outrage at stupid shit. What you're hearing now is people really concerned
*  about people's lives. You know, and I'm hoping that this is going to last, that this feeling
*  of understanding that we are really vulnerable. We're all we're in this together. We really
*  are, you know, and sometimes it takes something like this to happen where you go, oh shit,
*  but no, we really are. We're in this together. We just didn't realize it because it was easy.
*  It was easy to get by. It's really cool seeing the neighborhood aspect of it. Like I've been,
*  I don't know if you're on Nextdoor, I'd tell you you're on Nextdoor. That'd be hilarious.
*  But Nextdoor is like, you know, like it's a Reddit thread for your neighborhood and just
*  hearing people like, Hey, does anyone have toilet paper? And somebody's like, Oh, drop
*  off lemons, my lemon tree, you know, just like helping each other out. It's like, it's
*  pretty, pretty beautiful. It didn't happen before this, you know? It's very cool. It's
*  funny. Say lemons, my next door neighbor, she was handing out lemons yesterday. She
*  had a bucket, free lemons. Come take some lemons. Just set it out in front of the house.
*  Yeah, it's, there's good parts to being scared. You realize, you know, people get cocky, man.
*  It's one of the reasons why I like weed. One of the, like I've talked about this and people
*  think I'm kidding, but one of the reasons why I like weed is it makes me paranoid. I
*  like it. I can get cocky. People get cocky. You get confused, you know, you can, you can
*  start believing some pretty stupid things about just life in general. If you're not
*  humbled by a little fear, sometimes just a little nervousness, just a little anxiety,
*  just a little look up at the sky. What would we do if an asteroid shower just came down
*  unannounced and just completely wiped out the power grid? You want to talk about death
*  and disease? What we're experiencing now is this is a fucking dry run for a real apocalyptic
*  event. This is nothing. This is nothing in comparison to stuff that could happen. We
*  got cocky. We didn't think it could happen because nothing had happened in so long. And
*  we'd find these craters and be like, huh, huh, look, we found a spot where everybody
*  died in, you know, 200,000 years ago. Oh, look, here's a spot where the dinosaurs were
*  killed 65 million years ago. There's all these spots where they keep finding these gigantic
*  fucking craters. Here's where Noah's Ark crashed. Yeah, exactly. People that are really just
*  looking for Noah's Ark. You missed the point. Remember that guy from a long time ago and
*  made the video Noah's Ark? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I wonder what happened to that guy. Didn't
*  that guy want us to go look at it? Yeah. You're like, what are you going to show me a big
*  boat? I'm like, bro, but if you're coming to me, you already fucked up. You know, you're
*  coming to me to release your Noah's Ark information. This is I don't think this is real, sir. But
*  I think the Noah's Ark story is it look, you just have to put it through the filter of
*  time, right? We're talking about thousands and thousands of years ago. And we're talking
*  about people likely telling a story for hundreds, if not thousands of years before it ever gets
*  written down. And all these different versions of it get tossed around. But the heart of
*  the Noah's Ark story is a cataclysmic event happens. And this one guy collects a bunch
*  of animals. And he restarts civilization. That is, you could easily put that through
*  the filter of interpretation and say, I bet what happened was there was a small group
*  of people that survived some sort of massive cataclysmic event. And one guy convinced someone
*  or they made it up that he knew it was coming, and that God had been talking to him. So that's
*  why he was able to lead everybody. And then after they tell the story 3000 different times,
*  it gets all whacked out. And God comes down and tells him, Noah, you got to build a boat.
*  So he builds this boat and everybody laughs at him. And he brings on two of each animal.
*  It's the dumbest story ever. But it's a story that clearly it's not a real story. Because
*  I had that bit about if you told that to a five-year-old kid with a mental handicap,
*  he would be like, there's a lot of holes in that story.
*  I love that bit.
*  That bit was, but the accuracy of it is like animals eat other animals. You can't just
*  have two of each animal on a boat. That's ridiculous. That doesn't make any sense. That
*  makes zero sense. Like, what are you doing? Why are you lying to me? Something else happened.
*  But what they're trying to say is some animal survived and civilization restarted. They
*  didn't know how big the world was back then. People 4000 years ago, whatever it was, when
*  they first wrote these stories down or even had these ideas, those people had no idea
*  how big the world was. They were in their spot. If some shit went down in your spot,
*  you thought the world was ending. Can you imagine if you're living near Pompeii when
*  that Mount Vesuvius blows and the whole fucking town gets covered in ash and everybody dies?
*  Imagine if you're living anywhere near there. You would think that hell just broke out in
*  the world. You wouldn't think, oh, in Thailand right now, they're just chilling on the beach.
*  You wouldn't think that. You would think it's over like this for everyone everywhere. Meanwhile,
*  on the other side of the world in fucking New Zealand, they didn't even know what happened.
*  They had no idea. They're just hanging out. Meanwhile, these people are dead as fuck,
*  covered in ash. Over in New Zealand, they're just hanging out. You know, like that's how
*  the world is. The world's huge. And if some shit goes down in one part, back then you
*  didn't know. So if you were one of the people survived when some shit went down, you would
*  write about it. And then people would talk and they'd tell that story and they'd pass
*  it on to other people and they'd pass it on to other people. And somewhere through
*  these stories, they figured out there's like a framework in here for telling people that
*  shit could go down and that we have to work together and that we have to believe in a
*  higher power and that if you believe in a higher power and you believe in something
*  else that's bigger and better than you, you'll do better things while you're here. You know,
*  it's so obvious. Obviously, I could be wrong too. But that's my take on it. And I think
*  we've just had this giant stretch where none of those things happened. You know, we've
*  had a couple of hundred years of pretty easy life in terms of natural disasters. You know,
*  you got your occasional hurricane. Again, if you were there, you would think it's hell.
*  If you were, where the tornado hits. When we're chilling here in LA and a tornado hits
*  Louisiana, we feel bad. You see all 36 people die in a tornado. We feel bad, but you don't
*  feel it. You know, you don't know the sky monsters coming to take your loved ones. But
*  if you're there, that sky monster is a real thing. It's a sky monster just because it
*  doesn't have fangs, just because it doesn't laugh at you, it's ripping your family apart
*  and throwing fucking bath tubs in the air. And you ever seen, there's one video of a
*  semi like a semi truck spinning in the sky. Is it twister? No, no, no, no. It was real.
*  It was real. You saw the bitch? Really? Yes. Yeah. It hit a parking area for semi trucks
*  and these semi trucks were literally getting flown around in the air. Oh shit. Yeah. I
*  think we found this before. Dude, it might be a twister. Was Helen Hunt in it? No, no,
*  no. There it is. Okay. Look at this. Look at this. It's flying in the air. Oh my God.
*  Look at that. It's just like twister. It's just like twister, but it's real and it's
*  metal. There's a fucking, probably several thousand pounds and they're just getting flown
*  through the air by the sky monster. Now imagine if a huge dinosaur came through town and did
*  the exact same amount of damage, killed the exact same amount of people. You'd be like
*  fucking Godzilla's real. Oh shit. It's a fucking lizard monster, but we're not scared of the
*  sky monster the way we are of the lizard monster. You would never live in the land where the
*  lizard monster comes. And he just disappears. He just goes back up in the clouds. Yeah,
*  you see him over the mountains. You know he's coming. You're like, fuck, we got to get out
*  of here. That's just like the sky monster, but he doesn't chase you. Sky monster is blind.
*  He just, whatever is in his path. If he gets lucky and catches a town, just rips that fucker
*  apart. But if he just goes through the swamp and sends alligators into the air either,
*  he doesn't give a fuck. Sky monster is just doing sky monster type shit. He's not targeting
*  specific individuals, but the lizard monster would. That's the only difference. Right?
*  Like if Godzilla's real? Yes. If Godzilla's real and he only went to Louisiana, who the
*  fuck is going to live in Louisiana? Imagine if Godzilla's proven Godzilla's never gone
*  outside the boundaries of Louisiana. You go to Louisiana, everybody's running from Godzilla.
*  When no one in the movies leaves Tokyo, they stay there. They're just like, Hey, Godzilla's
*  back. Have you ever been to Tokyo? No. Brian and I went to Tokyo. It's pretty dope. I miss
*  Tokyo. I hope I can go one day. Maybe if it's still there. If it's still there. That'd be fun to edit
*  Godzilla into all these tornado movies. If you think about it, man, this virus, I've
*  been saying this about all viruses, that diseases are like demons. You know, and we just, if
*  we were losing, like, have you seen the numbers too? This is something that my friend Steve,
*  who's a doctor sent me, and this is a fucking crazy, a series of crazy statistics. But the
*  crazy statistics about how many people die, like it puts it into perspective. I mean,
*  and all life lost is valuable. All life loss is a tragedy. I'm not saying anything other than that.
*  But what I'm just, I'm not diminishing anyone's loss of life. But what I am saying is I was stunned
*  when I saw the actual numbers. So 2017 to 2018, H2N3 pandemic killed 61,000 Americans.
*  Did you know that? I didn't know that. Did you know that, Jamie? I've heard numbers like that
*  recently. Yeah, but not before. 2017 to 2018, hospitalized 30,453 and estimated affected
*  was 894,700 people by that flu. That's crazy. Overall death rate was 7.5 with a peak in January
*  2018 of 10.8. Again, I'm a moron, not a doctor reading you a text message. Maybe I shouldn't be
*  doing that. Maybe someone should look into this. 2009 pandemic, now this is the one that Bert said
*  he had. He said that H1N1 killed 83,300 Americans. Death rates range from 4% to 33% for pediatric,
*  0 to 22% for 18 to 64, for 0 to 4% for those over 65. Man, this is crazy. US case is 60.8 million,
*  274,000 hospitalized, 12,469 deaths in the US. I'm just going over all these different ones that
*  happened. Flu of the year of 2020, cases reported 45 million hospitalizations, 415,000 deaths,
*  48,000. That's for the 2020 flu, this flu season. There's so many people that die of the flu.
*  But obviously, when you see healthcare workers freaking out, this is different. What is different
*  about it? It's all at the same time. Yeah, it's all at the same time. It's new. It's a new virus.
*  People don't have immunity for it. They don't really know how to cure it. It attacks the
*  respiratory system. It seems to have a real quick turnaround from I'm not feeling so good to I'm
*  dead. It happens very quickly for some people, shockingly so. It seems to affect different
*  people in different ways. There's a lot going on with this one that has smart people going,
*  we need to fucking stay home for a bit. Everybody chill. No large gatherings. Just chill.
*  Do you ever get the flu shot every year? I feel like I get the flu almost every year, but I
*  never do the flu shot. Maybe you should do the other thing.
*  I didn't get it last year. I don't get the flu shot.
*  Is that a bad idea? I've survived and been healthy, but just eating well and not getting
*  the flu shot and then making sure I'm in the sauna and I exercise well and sleep well. I've
*  been able to shake it off. It's a good move. I probably should get the flu shot. If I got the
*  flu again, maybe I'd be like, fuck man, I should have got the flu shot. Let me just get that flu
*  shot. Whether it's diet or whether it's all the shit I'm on, all the different vitamins and
*  hormones and the fact that I'm in the fucking sauna for 25 minutes every day, but I rarely get sick.
*  It seems like you would get it more just because you're around gyms and saunas and places where
*  there's a lot of sweat. The only cooties I've gotten in the gym that scare me is staff. I've
*  gotten staff a couple of times. That scares me. Did you ever get ringworm? Yeah, I got that a bunch
*  of times. I got that twice at least, maybe three times, which is not that bad. You put Lamacil on
*  it, stay off the mat for a little bit. Then the products that I started using prevented or saved
*  me from that. It's a company called Defense Soap. Yeah, I use that. It's the shit because it's all
*  natural stuff. It's all tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil. It's not antibiotic in that it doesn't kill
*  off all the good bacteria. It just coats your body with this soap and it's all natural. It kills the
*  bad bacteria, but it doesn't kill good bacteria. I don't understand how that works, folks, but people
*  have known that forever. The tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil are good for infections and
*  preventing infections. I use it because I'm like a yeasty boy. I'm very yeasty. Are you yeasty? Yeah.
*  You get yeast infections? I give it. I give them. You give them out? Yeah, I give them out.
*  You're lucky if you get one from me. He does it him out like awards. Yeah, I've been lucky with
*  diseases. Knock on wood. This is a weird one if you're compromised. People that have lung issues
*  or people that have had, I hate to say it, Brian, but vaping. Vaping, yeah. I think cigarettes and
*  vaping and I wonder weed smokers though because I know it's always like- It's definitely not good
*  for you. Right. Yeah. It's like how bad is it for you? Tommy Chong, still going. I mean, I'm going to
*  he's my canary in a coal mine because Willie Nelson's out of the game. Willie Nelson moved
*  over to the edible game 100%. Oh, he did? Yes, he did. Couldn't take the smoking anymore. Wow.
*  Yeah, smoking was fucking him up so he moved over to the edible game.
*  Still fucks your lungs up. You're still coughing. Making psychedelic songs at 90.
*  Tommy Chong doesn't have to sing, right? It's true. It's the way he's going to sing songs.
*  Yeah, and just the smoke, just the hot smoke, apparently the number of joints that that guy can
*  put away is supposed to be terrifying. Toby Keith wrote a song about it. I'll never smoke weed with
*  Willie again. He wrote a song about getting high with Willie. Everybody says that. You get high
*  with Willie. Snoop versus Willie, who do you got? I got to go with Snoop. Yeah. I just got to go with
*  Snoop. I go with Snoop all day. Yeah. Out of respect. But Snoop is such a G, he might lay down,
*  he might take a dive just for Willie so Willie feels better. You know what I mean? It's like
*  true. I can win another day. This is Willie Nelson. You know, Snoop Dogg might, he might take a dive
*  in that one. But if they really wanted to go head to head, Snoop's going to be awake for days,
*  just still smoking. You think Willie smokes blunts? I thought he can't, but you think he does. Like
*  Snoop fucking tears down blunts. Yeah, I don't know what, but Willie used to smoke cigarettes,
*  right? So I bet he avoids blunts. Or he loves them. I know a lot of people that quit smoking.
*  They're like, no, I'm a blunt guy. Okay, we know what's going on here. Exactly. Well, I know a guy
*  who used cigars to get off of cigarettes, started smoking cigars and got his nicotine fix. But,
*  you know, it was felt better because he wasn't inhaling and just, you know, you just keep it in
*  your mouth. So your breath stinks. Smell up the place wherever you're at. Yeah, you don't like
*  cigars. No, I don't mind. I just like when you go to a place like, say you're at the comedy store
*  front patio and five people are smoking cigars, it's kind of like, get me the fuck out of here.
*  It's a little obnoxious. Yeah, that's a little of a little dick swingy. Yeah. You know, yeah,
*  because you're pretty much just taking over the air. Yeah, you're making people smell you.
*  Like if you go to one, the best place to go is one of those cigar bars. Because there's a bunch
*  of other cigar dorks in there. You guys can all get together. And apparently, is this true?
*  Are cigar bars essential? Is that one of those essential businesses that are open? I mean,
*  if pot shops are, I can imagine. Yeah, because here's the thing. People do get addicted to
*  tobacco. So what do you do about that? Do you say, hey, now's the time to quit? Sorry, you can't go
*  anywhere? Or do you let them, if that's how they get their tobacco fix, do you let them? What do
*  you think? I would say they're non-essential. But I mean, pot shops, I mean, look at gun shops, man.
*  My studio in Burbank's by three gun shops. I did had no idea. But there's three right next door to
*  me. And there's lines going down the street, like a mile long just to get a gun. Yeah, we have a 10
*  day waiting rate. Yeah. But still, 10 days later, you got a gun. Right. A lot of liberals change
*  their fucking tune. I have quite a few friends who would never consider having a gun. I had a
*  conversation with one of them yesterday. He's like, I've never had a gun in my life, never considered
*  a gun. I have a gun now. I'm like, yeah, that's probably smart. Yeah. Yeah. Better to have it,
*  not to need it, than to need it, not to have it. Right. And, you know, I'm hoping people come
*  together. I'm not hoping this turns into some crazy shootout in the streets. But I am, I'm happy that
*  people understand why people wanted guns in the first place, you know, because these things can
*  happen. And right now, nothing, nothing has happened, nothing really bad. But we're in a
*  state of chaos, and states of chaos deteriorate, or they go away. They don't, you know, it's not like
*  this is the new normal, I don't think. If it's just like this, then great. We don't need any more
*  guns. Basically, you know, it's like, we've got a good amount of guns. It's not like everybody needs
*  to go out and get a gun who never considered it before. But if it gets crazy, then you should have
*  a gun. Right. Like, if you don't want to have a gun, I don't think you should have to have a gun.
*  But what are you going to do if the whole thing completely falls apart? Imagine this scenario.
*  How would you feel if there's only a few people in your neighborhood with guns, and there's people
*  that were coming in and robbing, killing people, because we had gone all walking dead, because the
*  power had been off from the asteroid shower for six months, there's no way to even tell these people
*  are coming. But there's only two people in your block with guns. But there's 30 houses. Well,
*  what the fuck are you going to do? You only have two guns, and there's 30. That's not good. See,
*  that's what people are scared of. What people are scared of, and maybe they're wrong, but the
*  preppers right now are the ones laughing their asses off. The people with, you know, fucking
*  jarred peaches and shit, those people that you see on TV with their own well, they're laughing
*  right now. They're laughing. They're hoping it deteriorates even further, because they could
*  take over. They could be the king. Yeah. I wish I had a gun right now. Like, I have like a bunch of
*  fake guns. You never thought about having a gun before. Yeah. I mean, I'm one of those guys,
*  though, that, you know, I didn't grow up with guns, so they're kind of intimidating. And I feel like
*  I'm somebody that one night would be wasted. Like, I'm going to make a funny YouTube video.
*  There are a lot of dorks who do that. Flash guns on Twitch, one-up shooter. It's like
*  trusting yourself, you know? It's like, it's just you, you know, the problem is you can just buy a
*  gun if you're not a criminal, right? If you want to drive a car, you got to take a test.
*  But a car is not specifically designed to kill someone. It can kill someone accidentally. It's
*  not specifically designed to kill someone. A gun is specifically designed to kill,
*  and you don't even have to fucking show you how to use it. Right. That worries me too,
*  because that line by my house was a lot of middle-aged Karens, you know, like, oh, God,
*  did they train you there? Like, I don't even know the process. It seems like you should go through
*  like a training gun course. You definitely should. And better not pull a prank on Karen. Right. Karen
*  might be locked and loaded on 18 Adderalls, you know, pissing in her carpet because she's
*  too scared to get up. And she's sure that sound is a serial killer making its way up her stairs.
*  Me wants her cousin coming to check in on her. That kind of stuff happens. Yeah. People are nuts,
*  man. And you can just get a gun. If you're not a criminal, you know, you don't have mental health
*  problems. You can just get a gun. And you definitely should know how to use it. And it's just,
*  there's two schools of thought. The Texas school of thought is a well-armed society is a polite
*  society. And guess what? They're right in a lot of ways. That's right too. Another school of thought
*  is wouldn't it be great if no one had a gun and you never had to worry about getting shot? Yep.
*  Yep. That's good too. Also wouldn't it be great if the government was awesome and you knew they
*  would never turn tyrannical on you? Yeah, that'd be good. Yeah, that'd be good. But that's not true,
*  right? Because the government's made it out of people and look at China. You don't want what's
*  happening in China happening here, right? We all agree to that. We don't want to live under their
*  military dictatorship. I don't care how good it looks. That sounds terrible for us. We don't want
*  that. So we know that's real. It's happening right now. Other people trapped in a country,
*  they can't even use the real internet, right? They can't even get on Twitter. They can't get on
*  Facebook. Brian Cowan did a movie there. They took his phone away. They gave him a new phone
*  with Chinese social media on it. They're like, you could use this. That's it. They wouldn't let
*  him on Twitter. He couldn't go on Instagram. Yeah. He needs a VPN. It doesn't work. They block him
*  over there. Dude, they block everything over there. Apparently some VPNs work in Hong Kong,
*  but Hong Kong's not, it's sort of a different situation than mainland China. Bro, it's weird
*  that people can live the way those Chinese people are under the fist of a government
*  that pulls people out of... Did you see those people that got dragged away because they tested
*  positive for Corona? Where are those people going? Landfill. Yeah. Who the fuck knows, man?
*  That's happening at the same time as us, as we have so much freedom that people are looking for
*  shit to get upset about. Taking some of Trump, and Trump no doubt has said ridiculous shit.
*  That's not my point. It's not that he's infallible and he's always right. It's that you're wasting
*  time playing gotcha with the president of the United States in the middle of a pandemic.
*  Yeah, he's going to say dumb shit. Get used to it, but don't harp on that. Let's figure out what
*  the fuck needs to be done. That's what we need to figure out. I don't think anybody knows.
*  They're waiting in New York for it to peak. That's why they wanted all those ventilators.
*  They're going to set up some things in parks and shit in the Javits Center, apparently. They're
*  going to set up some sort of a temporary hospital unit. This is crazy, man. It's really cool seeing
*  all the manufacturing plants like Tesla and stuff making ventilators and converting their
*  factories to make hand sanitizers and stuff like that. People who know how to make masks and shit.
*  Printing masks. Jordy's brother, our friend Jordy, from Comedy Central, his brother is the one
*  printing out the masks. That's very cool. There's quite a few companies that are doing that.
*  That's very cool. Yeah, it's weird times, to put it mildly, right? Nothing feels normal. You wake
*  up in the morning like how am I supposed to feel? Wake up in the morning? What are you talking about?
*  Now it's like I go tomorrow. I'm like, okay, nothing to do tomorrow at all. Well, I guess I
*  could just stay up all night and go to sleep when I want to. I went to bed at like nine in the morning.
*  I played VR all night and ate mushrooms. Right now eating mushrooms is a little too crazy though.
*  Halfway through, I was like, this is where you're going and thinking. It was a little rough.
*  We just have to know that this, now we know that this can happen. Now we know. We didn't know.
*  We weren't getting all the information. But just the things that also are deadly,
*  that also affect so many people, like that list that I read off. Is that right? Is any of that shit
*  I read right? What do you think? It seems like it would be. I mean, nowadays, like you get all these
*  doctor lists on Facebook. You never know what's real and what's not. This is from a friend of mine
*  who's a legitimate doctor. Is that correct? Are those numbers correct? We should probably say.
*  Let's Google the numbers again. So what did I say? We'll start off with the first one.
*  The first one was, Michael Yeo apparently put out a video today. Oh, did he? Yeah. He's back.
*  Okay. Let's look at this one. The 2017 to 2018 H2N3 virus pandemic that killed 61,000 Americans.
*  I was looking that up. The hardest part with that right now is those numbers have been accumulated
*  over a year plus, and we only have had a month to collect these numbers right now.
*  Yeah. I mean, it even says 2017, 2018. But over a year, it killed 61,000 people.
*  Now, the other one was the big one at the end. The flu for this year, for 2020. Cases reported 45 million
*  hospitalizations, 415,000 deaths, 48,000. That's worldwide? No, it's the United States. Oh, really?
*  Yeah. Wow. I know. That's what I'm saying. I haven't even heard about the flu this year.
*  Well, that's the thing. It's not sexy because it happens every year. Right.
*  You know, it's like the sky monster. If the sky monster never appeared before, and then one day,
*  the first tornado hit and tore apart Nashville, we'd be like, what in the fuck? God's mad at us.
*  Right? That's how they used to feel back in the- It's just one person's case. I remember last
*  week I read someone that got tested for the flu and they tested positive, and then weeks later
*  got tested for the COVID-19 and then tested positive for that. But they weren't tested for
*  COVID at the time. They're tested for the flu because they didn't have a test. Right. So there
*  could be a lot of people that tested positive for the flu maybe that never had a COVID-19 test.
*  Yeah. Could be. Yeah. I mean, I guess it depends on whether or not they have the
*  tests available in different places too, right? I'm just not reading too. There's a new test that
*  just got made today that's got faster results. Oh yeah. Yeah. There's a five minute test. It's
*  like an easy bake oven of testing. Jamie, what are we going to do if you test positive? Oh yeah.
*  I don't know. Yeah. You're in contact, bro. I already have it then. Oh. I could be. Because
*  I'm testing positive. Does it mean- Right. Could be. You're out there spreading it.
*  Carrier. Get out of here. Son of a bitch. Don't pet my dog, you fuck. Oh, that's too late. I didn't
*  even think of that. They sent the email out, what was it, yesterday? Saturday, I guess. So like-
*  It's too late. When the fuck did they get it? That's when they got it to the hospital and
*  called the apartment building and said, hey, you might want to let everybody know. Are you washing
*  your hands a lot? You guys doing the whole thing? Oh yeah. I'm washing the shit out of my hands.
*  My hands are annoyed at me. I'm dried. I'm lucky I got some hand sanitizer. Oh, before the crash?
*  Right before it happened, the crash, I was opening up for Tom Green in San Diego. And Tom Green was
*  the first person that I knew that was kind of like panicking a little. He's like, I just bought
*  a crate of Lysol, mini Lysols, and he was spraying the microphone down on stage. And I was like,
*  he's taking a little overboard. Literally like a week later, everyone's doing that.
*  Tom Green, the head of the curve? Yeah. Yeah. Fuck. It's spooky, dude. Who was it that had a friend?
*  Was it Tom Papa whose friend was warning him long in advance? No, it wasn't Tom Papa. It was
*  Bert Kreischer. Bert Kreischer had a friend who was warning him way in advance, listen, you need to
*  isolate, you need to get your family out. And he was like, what? It was Bert, right? Yeah. Put your
*  shirt on. Yeah. Take your shirt on. Put your shirt back on. You need to isolate quickly, get away from
*  everybody because it's going to spread right through America. And he was like, what? And this
*  was apparently in February. And he was like, this lady's crazy. Wow. And then he texted her, like in
*  the beginning of March when it was on and popping, he's like, you're right. My point about showing
*  those numbers was not to diminish the impact of this current pandemic. It was just to highlight
*  the fact that we live in a war zone. We live in a virus war zone that takes out thousands of people
*  every year in this country. And I don't think most of us are really keeping our eye on that.
*  You know, like you hear about deaths by the flu and, you know, they're never, they're never shocking.
*  Deaths by some new thing for some reason, even if it's the same number of deaths, or less even,
*  right? So far less. Freak us the fuck out. It seems like it's happening more though, like if you go on
*  TMZ is like somebody dies every day, like this old, you know, philosopher or this old poet or this
*  old musician. And they're like, you never hear that in the past, like, oh, he died of the flu. That guy
*  died of the flu. That guy died of the flu. Here we go, Jimmy, just pulled something up. A total of
*  19,543 laboratory confirmed influenza associated hospitalizations were reported by FluServe-Net
*  sites between October 2019 and March 21, 2020. 41,172.1% were associated with influenza A virus.
*  What's that? 14,000. 14,000. What did I say? 41. Oh, whoops. What am I, dyslectic? Influenza,
*  okay, 5,335, 27.3% with influenza B. That's true too, right? If you get an influenza A shot and
*  it's influenza B, you might catch it anyway. That's annoying. So that's a lot of people,
*  right? So we got 19,500 and 5,300 and 14,100. Yeah. My theory is that you were born sucking
*  your thumb. You were supposed to suck your thumb your whole life and it was supposed to keep your
*  immune system strong so that it would fight all of these. Look at the hospitalization rate was 67.3%
*  per, oh no, 67.3 per 100,000 population, which is higher than all recent seasons.
*  Except for the 2017 to 2018 season, rates in children 0 to 4 years old and adults 18 to 49
*  are now the highest CDC has on record for these age groups, surpassing the rate reported during
*  the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Hospitalization rates for school-aged children are higher than any recent
*  regular season, but lower than rates during the pandemic. So what happened in 2009 when the H1N1
*  kicked in and killed all those people, they didn't shut anything down. I think what I've been hearing
*  is like after a thousand people died is when things started changing and I don't really
*  remember what was changing back then. I don't either. Do you remember? No. We just talked to
*  Bird again. Bird had it. He had the H1N1. He did? Yeah, he did. Yeah. He said it was the sickest
*  he's ever been in his life. And it was 2009 when it was all going down and he said he couldn't
*  sleep. He was so uncomfortable. He was in just constant pain and aching. He said he never felt
*  sicker ever in his life. And that killed a lot of people. I've had a flu like that before where,
*  you know, you're just puking shit and you can't hold anything in. You're sweating. You're waking up.
*  You know. Is that 2009? I don't think it was. I feel like it was like five years ago or something
*  like that. Six years ago. They can get you. They can get you. I hope another thing that comes out
*  of here is people take their fucking immune system more seriously. Support your immune system.
*  You know? I mean, if this makes a big, just a little shift in the number of people that get
*  healthy. Little shift in the number of people that start taking vitamins and exercising and,
*  you know, just do something, man. Something. Put a heavy backpack on. Go for a walk. Do something.
*  Listen to the podcast. Oh, I'm listening to this Aaron Hernandez podcast. Wondery has this podcast
*  called Gladiator about Aaron Hernandez. Holy shit. First of all, that's a great podcast.
*  You ever listen to Wondery? They know what they're doing, man. They, they, it's like really good
*  editing and sound editing and they, they put depth to it with all those different sound effects and
*  stuff and different, just different people's interviews and discussions. People that knew
*  Aaron Hernandez. Holy fuck. What a crazy story. Did you watch, you watched the tiger thing?
*  I have only watched one part of one episode. I'm saving it. I'm surprised. I went through all
*  episodes in one sitting last night. You gotta understand, I have gone down so many tiger rabbit
*  holes. I'm terrified to start another one. You remember that whole bit that I had about Texas
*  and tigers from Triggered? Dude, I went on a rabbit hole of tiger owners and people that own tigers in
*  their backyard because of that. That's why I think you're gonna love it. Like you love the Wild West.
*  But I've wrote that bit already. It's like that times a million. Yeah, I know. But it's done.
*  I know, but you gotta see this. It's every person's, and there's so many twists and turns that you're
*  like, this is not real life. This is not, this didn't happen. But it did. Yeah. Yeah. Listen,
*  I have all the faith in the world that white trash people could be unbelievable.
*  Yeah, but there's so much more to it that's like insane that we haven't heard of this guy before.
*  Like I don't, like. I know, right? Like he also had an internet show during all this, like an
*  Alex Jones type internet show. I feel like I would have seen it because his name, it was like Joe TV.
*  And I'm like, of course back in the day. Joe Exotic TV, right? Is that what it is? Yeah.
*  Now did he have it on YouTube or do you only have it on his website? I think he had it on
*  Ustream back in the day, like we did. That's what I'm saying. Like how did we not see this?
*  No, I could be wrong. But yeah. Who didn't care that much back then about people living with tigers?
*  Shakira Newell. 2011, you might have already seen some of this stuff and not known it.
*  He did a documentary with Joe Exotic. Oh, did Joe Exotic have his legs back then or no?
*  Joe had his legs the whole time. That was one of the guys that worked for him. He lost his legs.
*  But yeah, he did a whole hour long, like full documentary with him. Oh, no shit. Yeah. I'd
*  like to see that. Yeah. I got obsessed with him last night. I just, you know,
*  added him on Instagram, looking back at all the photos and.
*  Louis Theroux is the shit. His documentaries are so good. He's absolutely one of my favorite
*  because he's got this style of talking to people that eventually annoys them and to yell at him.
*  Whether it's the Westboro Baptist Church or my favorite one was this. He was at this wild
*  game park in Africa where people go over there and like shoot rhinos and, you know, they pay
*  X amount for that and Y amount for this. And he interviews these people in these wild game parks
*  and he stays there for like three weeks and eventually just annoys this guy to the point
*  where the guy snaps and is just ran about Africa. But the only way that these animals
*  are ever going to survive is if there were something. He's like, Africa is fucked.
*  And the way he was saying it to him was like this really intense
*  speech that he gave to through like all the rules, annoying him for all those days and standing by
*  him like this. So you're about to feed the tiger. It wasn't tigers, but he had lions
*  and they were throwing there like a dead cow and they threw it overboard. They was throwing
*  these chunks over the fence and these lions would just tear it apart. And I'm like, oh my God.
*  And he's there standing there watching us through like two fences. Within there's a pickup truck
*  and you look in these things eyes. They looked fucking ferocious and so angry. They look so angry
*  that they're in that cage and so angry that they have to get their food this way. And he was just
*  pestering this dude, pestering him. It's great. It's one of my favorite documentaries ever on how
*  f perplexing that situation is in Africa. They have more animals there than ever.
*  Like all their different animals that were on the verge of extinction are now thriving,
*  but they're thriving because they're valuable and people go over there to shoot them. So it's like,
*  oh, what do you make of that? That's people. That's people. We're so messy. Like we never do
*  anything like these animals were on the verge of extinction, but now due to the generous donations
*  of the millions of people in the world, these animals are healthy and they're thriving in
*  numbers greater than we've ever seen before. We could just go out in a car and watch these lions
*  take out these gazelles. There's no way they'd pay for it that way. If you want to make real money,
*  you got to make it valuable for people to go over there and shoot those things and eat them.
*  That's just fucked. It's kind of crazy because it's the only way that it works. Like we're so
*  selfish. But on the other hand, I heard kudu meat is delicious. Really? Yeah. I heard it's the best.
*  If you want to go shoot a kudu, you go over there with your friends, enjoy nice, nice cooked meals.
*  It's kudu everywhere. You go out, you shoot one, take a picture with it. Hey, we had a good time
*  in Africa. You eat it. Yeah, we ate it. It was awesome. Brought a bunch of it back, froze it.
*  I mean, you're eating burgers anyway. Isn't it better to just go out there and shoot a kudu with
*  a rifle and have a crazy story behind it and a memory that you'll never forget and also respect?
*  But we don't think about it that way. We think, God damn it, they're only worth something if you
*  shoot at them. It would be nice if it was both. Maybe there's competing conservation efforts,
*  like one conservation effort, like the people that want no animals getting shot. Like you guys
*  can have this ranch. We'll see how you do. And then the people that want to pay to shoot animals
*  have the other ranch and that ranch has a fuck load of money. Which one's going to do better?
*  The one that operates on donations or the one where people fly from Cincinnati to shoot a kudu?
*  I bet the one where they fly and they pay to shoot a kudu. I bet that one does better.
*  A lot of similarities with this tiger movie, man. What you just said.
*  Well, Texas does, I mean, it's another place where Texas is like, they don't give a fuck.
*  That's a whole different kind of America. Remember Ohio when they had to change that
*  law and I think with Zanesville where he let all his animals out and there's this tiger.
*  Yeah. We watched that. We watched clips of that in the Joe Exotic,
*  that the tiger king, when you see the beginning of it, that's really disturbing. You see all those
*  animals, those cops had to shoot. Virtual reality hunting is probably going to be the future.
*  Actually, did you ever see Tyson when he's explaining to me why he got a tiger?
*  I love Tyson, man. Have you been listening to his podcast? He's great. He's great. He's so genuine.
*  He's so genuine. Look, that's what we all want. You know, whether we agree with you or not agree
*  with you, we want you to be there for real. Like you might, maybe you're making mistakes,
*  maybe you're looking at things the wrong way, but I want you to, I can't listen unless I know
*  that you're really there. Mike Tyson is really there when he's talking about anything. He's not
*  bullshitting you. He's not an actor putting on a facade. He's Mike Tyson. And there's something
*  about that, man, that especially in like these fucked up times where everything is confusing,
*  it's very refreshing to see someone's authentic take on the world and be honest about their
*  journey in life and whose journey in life has been more strange and out of the ordinary and
*  spectacular than Mike fucking Tyson. I mean, Mike Tyson has had one of the most extraordinary lives
*  a human being has ever had, ever, you know, and people, they might try to diminish that in some
*  way because he's had some run-ins with the law or because of the nature of the way he became famous
*  by being the most violent man on the planet, the, you know, the best heavyweight boxer of his era.
*  But to get to be someone like he is, you have to have some extraordinary horsepower inside your
*  will. Like your will is a supercharged engine. There's something about that guy's will in his
*  mind. He might not be the most articulate, most well-read, most studied man on earth. He's not that,
*  but he's extraordinary. You have to be extraordinary to do what he did. There's no way around it.
*  He was so much better than anybody else when he was coming up. And you can only maintain that kind
*  of power and that kind of ferocity for a certain amount of time. I feel like a person at that kind
*  of pace that he was at, you can't really maintain that very long. He was such a destroyer. But if
*  you go back and watch him knocking out Michael Spinks and knocking out Marvis Frazier and just
*  smashing Larry Holmes when Larry Holmes was still, I think Larry Holmes was in his thirties, he was
*  still, I mean, wasn't in his prime, but he was still Larry fucking Holmes. He smashed everybody.
*  I miss those days watching TV, the old Tyson fights. That was like a Super Bowl.
*  Every time they're just getting around, it was a family affair. You get the whole family around.
*  I know. Everyone would get together. You would get mad if he was going to fight someone who was
*  going to be like 15 seconds. Like fucking Bruce Seldon. Come on, man. You get mad.
*  Did you see this little clip of him before the Fury Wilder fight? He meets Chad Johnson in the back
*  of the arena. Oh, no shit. And he, all right, watch the interaction, why this went big is
*  because the interaction when he notices the cameraman behind Chad Johnson. Yeah,
*  we're going to get pulled. I'm not going to play the whole thing on. It's only like 10 seconds.
*  Okay. It went, it went pretty viral though. So it's like newsworthy ish. What went viral about it?
*  Watch this. Okay, here we go.
*  That dude's filming. He's like, what'd you do with that phone? He got right in his face.
*  Shit his pants. Oh, how would you not shit your pants? Yeah. Mike Tyson is tired of people
*  filming him. I found him to be very sincere. I really enjoy his company. Like I enjoyed talking
*  to him before the show. It was, it's kind of surreal. I met him at the com at a, excuse me,
*  at the UFC. I met him at the UFC a few years back. I got a photo with him and he's like,
*  you're that dude who smokes all that weed. And I started laughing. I went, what's up, man.
*  Mike Tyson knowing who I was was just strange. Him wearing that biker's jacket, the old black
*  classic. Yeah. Kind of like that looks cool. I want to get back to it. Yeah. He's an interesting guy,
*  man. For sure. I love that he's got his podcast. He was going to, um, he, they asked me to be on it,
*  um, through Skype. I'm just going to wait. I want to be there in person, man. Where's he recorded?
*  Wait till that shit blows over and then I'll go visit. Look at that. He's great, man. Yeah. He's,
*  um, he's, he's getting really good at this. Him and Eminem. Oh shit. That's Eminem. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Very interesting. How did Eminem get a black beard? What happened?
*  He dyed everything. His face hair. I don't think he had face. No,
*  I think he bleached his hair when it was blonde. Right. Is that what it is? Yeah.
*  So that's his real hair color. Yeah. That or he, he probably does what I do, put a little just for
*  men on it in the beard. Yeah. That shit can fuck your face up, man. I, uh, did a rabbit hole one
*  day on the just for men and I saw this guy who had his face burned. Yeah. It like burns,
*  like chemical burns on his face from maybe it wasn't just for men, but some kind of hair dye.
*  Probably. We'll find out. You gotta wash it out. I can't sleep. Yeah. Just for men. He wanted it
*  really dark. Yeah. He wanted to really freak people out. See, but Google like, uh, hair dye,
*  face burn. Shit. I mean, it's fucking chemical, man. Shaved my head last night because the George
*  Greg Fitzsimmons, man. You like, he got rid of the sides. I needed a haircut. I'm like,
*  it's going to be a month till I get a haircut. Yeah. There's something about the sides that hold
*  you back. If you're a bald man with the sides, unless you're doing a lot of ass, even I just
*  sort of thinking about this, you're supposed to like test any hair dye on your skin just to make
*  sure you don't have any sort of bad reactions to it. Bro. Who's reading that? No one's reading
*  that. You almost have to, but like no one does. I know, but dudes don't read. When I bleached my
*  hair, you know, I used to bleach my hair like once a year, it would, there'd be burns, there'd be
*  scabs in my hair. I would just peel out scabs because it, I mean, it just fried my head. Well,
*  they said that there's a, a link that they're exploring between women dying their hair and
*  breast cancer. Have you, have you read this? Yeah. There's always a link. That's a scary link though,
*  man. But if you think about it, if a woman is dying her hair on a regular basis, how often the
*  chicks dye their hair every two months, because it's gray. Imagine if you take in poison every
*  two months, because your skin is, you know, the dermis of your skin, the epidermis, your skin
*  absorbs all kinds of stuff. I mean, your skin absorbs magnesium through the float tank. It's one
*  of the- This study says it's for permanent hair dye and chemical hair straighteners. So it's not
*  quite the same as like what most people use. Most people use like a semi-permanent- What is,
*  what is for permanent hair dye? The researchers say women who use permanent hair dye and chemical
*  have a, chemical hair straighteners have a higher risk for breast cancer. Oh, okay. So it's not the
*  temporary hair dye that most gals get? Right. So all these chicks going gray need to cut it out.
*  I'd like it if you pretend you're not aging, please. Yeah. Go back. What would you rather have
*  though? A woman that had long gray hair or just shaved her head? I don't- Listen, man,
*  I don't want to answer these questions. However, experts say women shouldn't give up hair products
*  based on this study alone. What experts say? Who the fucking- I hate when they say that. Experts
*  say. Who- Experts in what? Well, I'm really good at Parcheesy. National Institute of Health.
*  Yeah. What do they know? I don't know. I don't trust anybody, man. I'm going Eddie Bravo on this
*  bitch. They're all lying. Liars. They're all in bed with the fucking dye company. For chicks,
*  the head shave is a scary move. Yeah. It's a scary move. Some girls pull it off though.
*  Some gangster gals have done that during isolation. They've shaved their fucking heads.
*  Gone with the crew cut. Start wearing wigs. Girls can wear wigs, man. Yeah. Yeah. Girls can wear
*  wigs. Guys cannot. Nope. Nope. I got a pretty good wig right now. Girls can do whatever they want,
*  we'll still fuck them. Imagine if guys had fake tits. Girls would be like, what are you doing?
*  Girls don't even have real muscles. They're way more picky than we are. If they have fake boobs,
*  we're like, awesome. We don't even care if they're fake. We know they're fake. It means nothing.
*  It's not like we need to be tricked. We're so stupid. We're like, oh, look, you got water bag.
*  Make them poke out more. I like better. We like the fact that they look fake. It's like there's a
*  shape burned into our DNA and that shape is plump tits. And whatever you need to do to get to that.
*  But if a guy has some plastic rod and it's cock that stretched it out and made it harder,
*  if women found out about that, they'd be like, yuck. Yeah. Dudes are not allowed to have fake hogs.
*  Would a woman prefer anything fake on a guy? Do they like anything at all?
*  I'm sure some women. Yeah. Tension spam. They want you to pretend. They want you to pretend
*  you give a fuck about their dumb stories. You got to sit there. Oh, and then she said that, huh?
*  Huh? That's what some women like. And some women don't even like that. See? Can't generalize.
*  Don't be a sexist pig, Jamie. I'm trying to learn over here. So embarrassing to be on this podcast
*  and you say something so sexist. There's dudes that'll do that. They'll throw you right under
*  the bus. Be very careful of those people. Very careful of those gender traders. Those guys who
*  they know you're fucking around, they'll throw you in front of the bus, right in front of the ladies.
*  Why will they do that? Because they're weak cunts. And there's a lot of them out there.
*  And those are the ones that don't have guns, I bet right now. Those are the ones. Those are the ones
*  that are 13th in line at the gun store and it's 10 to five and they know they're not going to make it.
*  Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. I need a gun. Fuck. Did they close them? Does the gun stores say that?
*  No, they're 24 hours. They give away guns. They drop them out of helicopters through the roof and
*  then they just distribute them evenly. They were supposed to close them and then they did it in
*  Burbank and then they said they were going to just raid the place if they don't close them.
*  And then I think Trump just said yesterday or two days ago that it's essential. Yeah, essential.
*  Essential. Gotta have a pistola. But Burbank police are like, we're not even going to
*  mess with this. We don't care. They're not arresting anybody for anything.
*  We're over here. Just let us know if shit gets really crazy. Mad Max. Do you play the new Doom yet?
*  Scared. Oh my God. It's scary. I gotta say I was a little disappointed that they didn't have
*  death match. They didn't have one-on-one death match. They don't? No. They don't have like you
*  versus a bunch of people in a room just killing each other. I thought they had that. No. Right?
*  They don't, right? You have to, it's like two working again. It's a new type of multiplayer mode.
*  I hope they come to their senses. It could. It could be a downloadable content. Like I just got
*  the new Half Life. You were a big in the Half Life back in the day, right? Yeah, I heard it's in VR
*  now. Oh my shit. Did you get it in VR? I got it in VR and I got the hand finger tracking so I could
*  sit there and pick out like a single bullet and put it in, you know, like type shit. Really? It's
*  so- So gloves? You have gloves? No, it's just like these- They flip, slip over the finger tips?
*  Controllers. Yeah. And what's weird is that it's, I got the Vive Index, which is like the highest end
*  one you can get. And it's so real that it's like the first time where I felt like I was in a room.
*  Before it's always like I'm in a room in VR. Now this was like, this is too realistic. Like there
*  was a part where I had to open this old elevator. I'm like, I'm not walking in this elevator.
*  Is that good? How's the definition? I mean, it's amazing. You're both nodding very vigorously.
*  No, no, it's like, it's so real that I couldn't, I was too scared to walk in the elevator because I
*  hate elevators. Dude, I'm in. It's scary though. Well, I'm hoping that Doom does that. And then
*  look, what we did see at Doom looks fucking amazing. It looks amazing. I mean, the fucking
*  graphics are off the chart. The gameplay looks really cool. The weapons look fucking totally
*  bad ass. But if they did that in VR, oh my God. Do you have a Doom in VR? Yeah, it's not quite there yet.
*  Dude, if they did Doom Eternal in VR and you put that bitch in a warehouse and you run through the
*  game in a couple hours, too much cowers you would burn. The world would be ripped. We get people in
*  such good shape. Because you had something like Doom, right? And you're in a warehouse.
*  Like I told you, they do with Sandbox. Sandbox has a bunch of dope games like that. But they don't
*  have anything that goes on for like three hours. Or like if there was a place where you could go,
*  we could get blocks at time. Like, yeah, I reserved warehouse four from nine to 12. And it's you
*  and like five friends and you have three fucking hours, three hours with fake guns and resources.
*  And you drink real water. And you're wandering around this warehouse. You got to try Half-Life.
*  What if they had a virtual toilet? You don't even take your VR off to piss.
*  You walk up to a toilet. It's a real toilet. They have these suits now you can see. Yeah,
*  they have these suits now you could buy that you put on that vibrate. So you feel things and like
*  you could be like in a game and you could feel water like like water drops hit you and stuff.
*  And they have all these trackers now that you could put. And you can do that with Doom? I mean
*  with Half-Life? You could almost do it to any game if you know what you're doing. That's a problem.
*  There's a lot of PC shit involved with having VR. Like the Vive Quest, I think it's called,
*  where it's you don't have any PC. You just put it on. That's the future. But right now you still
*  have to hook it up to a nice PC. Dude, we got Oculus and on one of the Oculus ones, it's the
*  one that's really dope because it's just a headset and it works off of an iPad. And the one where
*  you walk the plank. Oh that's the scariest shit ever. Yeah, I have that. But this the new stuff,
*  like I've unfortunately still have cameras everywhere tracking. But like you go lay down
*  in it and like it knows like if you see something you can lean in and pick something out. You know
*  it's room scale. So you're walking. Dude, yeah. This is the future. The future is you're not going
*  to have a life. You're going to get sucked into those things and you're going to be playing them
*  all day long because it's going to be way better than life. You're going to be working your shit
*  job at the Amazon warehouse. Can't wait to go home and you're going to get home, strap that fucking
*  headset on and party. When you're trapped inside, it gives you more space to explore, which is like
*  probably a little bit of a mental escape. Well, I think this is also going to open up a lot. True.
*  I think in the future, a lot more people are going to be using like video conferencing and stuff like
*  that instead of meetings because we realize how way better this is instead of meeting and getting
*  you know going to this business and working. You can just sit there and talk nowadays. I don't know
*  why people don't Skype more or use this you know technology that's. Well, I think people want to
*  go outside and experience life and still want to meet in a building to work together. I think
*  people still like that. You think this is going to change anything like that? Yeah man, everyone's
*  going to be afraid. How long is it going to be before you can just hug a stranger? College is
*  going to change because like oh yeah kids are learning right now. They're like, oh what the
*  fuck was that going to happen? So dumb. Everyone's going to be so scared. The concerts. But meanwhile,
*  the last big concert that I saw was um who the fuck was it in Denver? They got in trouble.
*  Always tired. Always tired. Tattooed. Post Malone. Post Malone. This weed is too strong.
*  I just had four extra hits for some strange reason. He did a show in Denver. He was like one of the
*  last ones to do it. I was looking out and it was like you know 18,000 people or some shit. The
*  Pepsi Center. I looked out there. I'm like wow it's a lot of people that could get it.
*  All those spring breakers stacked on top of each other after that.
*  Did you see it? Like someone made they used some computer program to track cell phone data
*  and they showed all these people like on a little teeny part of Fort Lauderdale Beach
*  over like a two-day period and then watched their cell phones disperse across the country.
*  And see where the disease is going. They just fucking took off everywhere. Not that everyone
*  there had a disease. They all did. They're just showing you how fast they have a disease. They're
*  all stupid. They're all young. They're all infected with young. Yeah I didn't see that but I'm not
*  surprised. Well it's weird like April 1st is like you know when this first shit first started
*  happening. I think like the comedy story like we're going to be closing until around April 1st.
*  Now that's not going to happen. It might be May. I think the governor said he wants two months
*  right? Yeah. Did he say two months from now or two months total? I don't know. Two months from now.
*  I think it's from now. From now. So June. Fuck. I don't understand like if you were like a waiter.
*  I know when I was a waiter for 10 years I went paycheck to paycheck. You know if I. The real
*  problem is unemployment. Yeah. If they were I mean they have to be honest too about the tips.
*  Okay so these are all their cell phones. Yes. They're zooming in on a like they combine two
*  data sets to show like this is like what companies actually use for tracking advertising stuff
*  normally but this company's tried to show how fast shit can spread so they're showing a little
*  heat map of cell phones on a little piece of a beach here in Florida and then they take all of
*  those data points and then he makes the timeline go ahead a couple of days and you just watch them
*  spread from there. Wow. It's fucking nuts. So it's not even that many of them. It's probably a couple
*  thousand. I think it said it was six thousand of them or 5,500 of them maybe and then he just
*  said it's a bit slow. Let's timeline go ahead a little bit and those that want to see this you
*  can look up a Twitter account called tectonics GEO. How interesting. And you'll see the video
*  there. Look how far it spreads. I mean it's half the country. Wow. You know what's also crazy it
*  really is a cell phone because the cell phone's so dirty. Who cleans their cell phone? You touch
*  your ass. You touch your cell phone. You touch your dick. You touch your cell phone. You touch
*  your nose. You touch your cell phone. You put your cell phone on the table or someone else's
*  cell phone was. You put your cell phone in your pocket. You fart on it. You put your cell phone
*  in your car. Your car is disgusting. I mean and even what's dirty I know that like if I have
*  something crunchy on my screen it's not like I'm clean. I'm just like I'll use my. It's annoying.
*  Scratch it off there. I'm not washing my cell phone but I'm gonna start washing it. One thing
*  good is I got the iPhone 11. It's IP68. So if you don't have a phone that is that's waterproof.
*  Do you have the green one? Yeah I got the green one bro. I'll bring them in. I have some Windex
*  specifically for electronics wipes. Thank god but it's too late. Get that phone cleaner I got man.
*  Yeah maybe that's a move. Everybody puts their phone in a heater, a microwave. What is it? What
*  kind of light is it? Ultraviolet light? It's the same as that thing? Yeah. Yeah. How weird is that?
*  Kills their DNA. That seems really malicious. Why don't we just all replace our light bulbs
*  with these lights? Dude. Well some guy was saying that we should carry around these ozone things.
*  If you there's a thing that deer hunters have been using forever and it's an ozone spray. So
*  you stand there and this ozone bath washes over you. So even if deer are coming upwind. Right? So
*  they're walking into the wind and your smell is blowing in their face. Your smell is covered by
*  this ozone. Ozone spray. That's what stoners used to buy from water beds and stuff and spray in
*  like rental cars after they're returning them. I don't know if that was real ozone but that was
*  the name of the brand. Yeah. But real ozone it actually does on some levels mask your scent.
*  You could see a deer smell it. They get confused like because if a deer smell you they just get
*  the fuck out. We stink to deer. That's the number one tool that they have to get away from humans
*  is smell because they don't see you from like 500 yards away. They don't pay. You're not an
*  immediate threat. You're all the way over there. You move in. They might go what is that? Let me
*  get the fuck out of here. But they're generally confident that at 500 yards away from you they
*  can kind of get away from you quick enough. But if you're close to them and they smell you
*  they fucking run. They run dude. They run. Like if you're in the close meaning realistically
*  they can smell you a couple hundred yards 300 yards. The wind comes to them. It catches them.
*  They see it and they just start bouncing away. They run away. We stink. We smell like meat.
*  We smell like something that eats meat. You know we smell like a predator. We smell gross.
*  So they're like fuck. Imagine someone you can smell the way you smell skunk.
*  If you smell the person like over the top of a hill like a wind gust you like you smell that.
*  Fuck. We got to get out of here. That's what it's like to them. It's like if skunks were murderous
*  animals looking to shoot at you. Or being in India. In India. Why in India? Because you could
*  smell people in India. Especially now. They can't even leave the house. You see in India where
*  they're attacking them. If you're in the streets they're just like beating the shit out of it.
*  Like the police. There's a bunch of different countries that are going to do that. The China
*  one was the scariest. When they're dragging those people away I was like what is going on?
*  I guess there's photos of like outside of our hospitals here in Los Angeles of just
*  semis filled with bodies. Somebody posted the other day. Well how many people have died in Los
*  Angeles? Not that much. So I don't know. You sure they weren't caskets? I think it's because
*  they're they have to because they have the virus and they die to the virus they have to keep them
*  like separate from like regular. I don't know. Bro. What's your take on this? Give me the Brian
*  Red Band take. When do we get out of this? I think we're in it for a lot longer than we think. I
*  think like a good two more months maybe max. And I think we are I think this is just fucking weird.
*  Does this set a precedent do you think? I think there's a lot of depression issues. I know a lot
*  of people if I was single right now I would not be able to take this. Disturbing video shows dead
*  bodies loaded onto truck outside New York City hospitals. New York. So it's a freezer truck though.
*  But here's my question. Are they gonna what if the flu next year is particularly vicious?
*  Are we gonna do this all over again? This is the question like. So this could come back in the fall
*  that Dr. Falsey guy's saying. So like this could be. It could come back in the summer. Yeah. And
*  how long are they saying on the cure? Well they don't even think they can come up with a vaccine
*  for 16 to 18 months right? That's what they said. Because of how they do the testing and whatnot. I
*  think they said 18 months. It's like they're hopeful for a year and a half. Can't they do like
*  what China did when they built those hospitals? Get like every single person in the world together
*  and be like let's all figure this out in a month. I don't know if they can. I don't know if they can
*  man. I know everyone's donating their computer processing power right now to get try to find a
*  cure for it. I don't know if you saw that. There's a where you know where you could install that
*  thing on your computer. And so when you're not using it it's using your computer to help you know
*  cloud based like find a thing. And I want you know I wonder if everyone did that.
*  Well I mean if they they need to do clinical trials. If clinical trials take time. So if they
*  do this chloroquine stuff or some other things that they come up with. They have to try them on
*  animals. They have to figure out whether or not it would work on people. Then they have to try it on
*  people. There's a whole process that they have to go through. It's not like there's some miracle
*  that they're holding back on. That's what's so scary about this shit. When we were at the CDC
*  in Galveston Texas Duncan and I went down there and I think it's the Center for Disease Control.
*  I think that's what it's called. This building where they house everything that'll kill you. Ebola.
*  All kinds of shit that'll just kill everybody in this big ass building with super thick walls
*  and vacuum. They were explaining how they suck all the air out of the room with they have vacuum
*  hoses and these guys are built like you know they have these suits that are built like astronaut
*  suits like they're on the moon. It's crazy protection that they have and then they're
*  working with these viruses and these deadly diseases. I'm like oh it's like a bad idea.
*  Oh my god it's so terrifying. Talking to him me and Duncan both freaked out because at first we
*  were thinking what if Russia came up with some kind of crazy disease and turned it on the world.
*  You know we were scared of that. Like what about weaponized viruses? What about that? And they were
*  like yeah yeah that can happen but you know what's happening all the time? New viruses. They're like
*  what we're really scared of is shit like the Spanish flu or h1n1 or all these different
*  flus that just show up and wipe out people in a different way. Like the Spanish flu particularly
*  killed young men. Like really healthy men with really good immune systems for whatever reason.
*  Those are the ones that got jacked. A lot of them. It was a weird like this one kind of it's not as
*  bad for young people but it's much worse for old people. Some of them vary. Some of them are really
*  bad for young people. Yeah some of it's random. Yeah and those he was really scared of that. He
*  was like this is what we're concerned about. We're concerned about nature itself. We're not concerned
*  about people making some sort of a weaponized virus. He's like that would be terrible but what
*  we're concerned with is what's happening all the time. These viruses are mutating and morphing and
*  changing and becoming more powerful and resistant to antibiotics and like whoa bro.
*  He scared the shit out of both of us. We walked out of there and we're like man
*  it just made us realize like oh this just hasn't happened in our lifetime. Like you know in a way
*  that's we're confronted with it until now. You know now it's happening. There's some new thing
*  that we don't have a cure for. You know. Then you add internet and social media to that and
*  it's just panic. You know you're not just seeing the news. And there's value in it.
*  If you freak people out they'll click on links. If they click on the links you get all the ad revenue.
*  If you're writing some sensationalist story that's real clickbaity with a clickbaity title
*  people jump to it and then you get those ad clicks. So you're encouraged
*  to make these sensationalist stories that are interesting to read. And I'm as guilty as anybody
*  if I see something ridiculous I'm like what what did he say? What what did she do? Where did she
*  get that money? And I'll go click on it too. And then when I'm disappointed I'm like oh
*  how many people read the whole thing? You know. Yeah I read something the other day that was I
*  think was clickbait and not real about how meth might fight the coronavirus. Meth heads.
*  Me and Eddie Brava used to always joke about how there's no one who's like a
*  meth proponent like a weed proponent. There's no one out there because there's fucking people
*  try to evangelize with weed right? Yeah. Oh tons. Yeah. And mushrooms. Oh yeah. And damn she. Yeah
*  me I'm guilty of that. All of us do. But you have something that you think is spectacular and you
*  want other people to try it. We were like does anybody do that with meth? Yeah. If anybody's
*  like dude you want to clean your fucking apartment? Yeah there's coke heads that that that do that
*  doesn't seem as bad like because there is medical purposes for cocaine but yet. Medical purposes.
*  There's nothing for meth. What medic there's well there is. Numbing agents. Adderall's pretty close.
*  That's what I was going to say if you called meth Adderall then you definitely have lots of
*  proponents for it. Yeah dude Adderall is real close to meth. Yeah. And I know multiple people
*  that have a real issue with that stuff. Yeah. Some of them that have completely lost their mind.
*  Adderall is like any other thing where you're perturbing your natural state all the time.
*  Like your balance gets off. You don't know where you are. You don't know what you're doing. You
*  don't know what you're saying. You're saying things and realizing that you said them after you said
*  them. You're talking constantly. Like you know what happens to those fucking Adderall heads. They
*  get real weird. They get real weird. They get angry at people that did nothing to them. They think
*  there's conspiracies. They think there's helicopters flying around looking for them. They get meth-y.
*  They get real meth-y. Especially if they're abusing it. And most most are it seems like. Yes. A lot of
*  them are taking it off label. A lot of them are just taking it recreationally. They're just taking
*  it because they they want a little juice. Is there any ice in there? Yeah there's ice in there.
*  And cooties. Probably cooties in those. Don't reach your hands in there.
*  These are pretty good. These little CBD. Oh they're the shit. 25 milligrams of CBD in each one of them.
*  I'm super addicted. Mango tango. Kill cliff. Yeah this is the new flavor. The mango tango flavor.
*  Sweet I don't like. There's a bunch of new ones. I like mango and things but like raw mango.
*  I always get it feels like like new carpet. Like chemical taste. See that's just because you smoke.
*  Is that why it opens up some weird. Yeah it's murdered your taste buds. Mango's delicious.
*  How often do you smoke cigarettes though? Not much. I mean this jewel this jewel is my favorite thing.
*  I mean look you got a little. Oh my god. We're gonna die. Yeah that's just sorry about that. No worries.
*  Don't put that back in your glass. Oh I'm not gonna drink that. Oh it's like you're a fucking savage.
*  He's got cigar butts in there and shit. He's like we're back on Fear Factor.
*  What were you saying? No like these jewels I mean I got I got really into the jewels and
*  it seems you know I used to when I smoked I would wake up in the morning and like
*  breathe like I could feel the cigarette in my lungs and like I don't have that anymore but I
*  also notice I suck on this thing all day like it's a lollipop you know and that cannot be good.
*  Well I found out from Adam Curry what the fucking lowdown is. Adam Curry you know the original
*  guy who came up with podcasting. He's the the Mac Daddy the OG. He's like our Lucy.
*  Like Lucy that that was that was that fake was Lucy faked. Lucy. Do you know what I'm talking
*  about? Lucy's the first fossil of mankind humankind a woman that they found who's like one of the
*  the first recognizable homo sapiens I think or one of our ancestors one of the first recognizable
*  ancestors but someone said that there's something faked about it that there was a recent controversy
*  and I didn't look into it but I'm remembering it right now.
*  Was Adam before Leo? Remember Leo? Well he was on that show well Leo was on that show
*  the screen savers. I fucking loved that show. I was a nerd. That was my super nerd days too and I was
*  those were the days when I was actually making computers you know I would go and buy all the
*  parts and put computers together and shit. I loved that show but Adam started his shit I mean he
*  gave us the whole timeline on the show but it's super clear he's the first. He wasn't the first
*  he's the first that survived that's still around today for sure. He proceeded us by many years.
*  Yeah. But he was he had an idea to do this shit back when he was on MTV. He just happened to be
*  beautiful. He's like a super long nerdy guy who just happened to be beautiful when he was young
*  you know because you could you would kind of dismiss him as being a pretty boy but he's a genius
*  brilliant guy and I really really dug talking to him like he's really cool. You would like him too
*  man. He's super cool and super fucking smart and super tuned in to all aspects of privacy in the
*  internet and you know he's telling us about phones that are that are they're making these new phones
*  that are Linux based phones that are completely private they don't send any data to anywhere. He's
*  into that kind of shit. He's into those laptops that Snowden uses that have kill switches on them
*  so you can kill the microphone and kill the like with an actual physical switch kill the webcam.
*  Yeah I like all those old MTV like Matt Penfield remember him the guy did Headbangers Ball. Oh yeah
*  the bald guy and like all those old MTV. We grew up with it those were our DJs our video DJs. You
*  know remember Kennedy? Yeah. She's a Fox News Republican pundit. No shit. Yeah. Does she look the same? Does she have like the sexy glasses?
*  She looks great. She looks really good considering how long she's been on television for you know I
*  mean she's got to be at least my age. She definitely looks better than Puck right? I haven't seen that
*  poor guy. He had a rough go of it. Yeah. Kennedy is on she's still on MTV right? I mean on Fox News right?
*  Was. Was? She's not anymore? Currently on hiatus. On hiatus. Did she get in trouble? No coronavirus
*  programming. Oh it's all webcams and shit. They're all going to just give up and start doing podcasts.
*  They're going to realize you fucked up. That all that Fox News stuff and with all that all that
*  being in a studio come on. News is so stupid like I love how they're sitting farther apart but they're
*  like sitting like two feet away like all right come on you're not social distancing responsibly.
*  The local NBC channel like they're all over at somebody's house and you can tell it's the same
*  house because it's the same lighting and they're obviously not going to have a cameraman at three
*  different houses you know so they they they have one guy in the living room one guy in the dining
*  room and then like the bee reporter guy he's like sitting in front of like a garbage can in the
*  kitchen. Imagine if the coronavirus of coronavirus forced everyone into doing podcasts and all
*  regular television died. Close. I hope. It's close but people still rely on those big names to like I
*  want to hear what the BBC has to say about it you know I want to see I want to see what NBC says.
*  It's pretty amazing how much I watch YouTube more than I watch TV nowadays like everything is
*  YouTube now. I subscribe to people like every day I'm like oh I want to see the latest episode. Oh
*  yeah for sure. I waste a lot of fucking time on it too looking at car videos. Yeah like looking at
*  old hot rod videos and stuff. Um. Ritory builds. What were we just talking about? Shit I was going
*  to ask you a question. Everything's going on podcasts. Kennedy. Gone. In and out. In and out
*  of my brain. It had something to do with uh with these shows. What they're oh I can't. How many
*  people are doing podcasts now who's doing a podcast? Switching everything. It's not you're not helping.
*  I got way too high. But I needed that. Like a day like this it's just too weird. I don't want
*  to be sober right now. Yeah I'm watching car videos though. I love watching. I love car videos.
*  Yeah. I love old cars. I'll never own. I don't even want them. But I like watching them. Some
*  dude driving an old Fiat the other day on a mountain road. I was like oh look at that. Looks cool.
*  I don't want to do that. I just think there's something about mechanical things that people
*  create and work on. That's probably my favorite part about it. I like these new car or these cars
*  or these companies are taking like old classic cars and then gutting a Tesla and putting all
*  the Tesla stuff inside of it. There's a Russian car company that's doing that now with a 1967 Mustang.
*  Wow. But they're building the Mustang out of pure carbon fiber. Yeah so it's going to be really
*  light. And they estimated a zero to sixty of 2.2 seconds. See you'll find this. It's like uh it's
*  a really new company that's coming out with this. What do you have to do when you get one if you buy
*  that and need to get it fixed? Do you have to take it back to them? You got to send it to Rich Benoit.
*  Yeah. Send it to Rich Rebuilds. Yeah. To Electric Garage in Massachusetts. Where's this place? Give
*  him a shout out. Thanks. Massachusetts sounds great. He's so funny. Yeah but I mean where in
*  Massachusetts? He's great right? He just put a video up about the nipples and this little kid.
*  I love him. Where'd you get this? Did he give this to you? He gave it to me. Yeah. He added to the
*  collection. I love his videos. He keeps Tesla honest. He keeps everybody honest. He hates a
*  lot though on the Model X and that kind of drives me crazy. New Hampshire? No he doesn't
*  live in New Hampshire. Hey man the electrified garage. It's in New Hampshire huh? Weird. I
*  thought he was in maybe opened the garage in New Hampshire. But uh he's on this uh thing lately
*  where he's talking about superchargers. Seabrook, New Hampshire. Seabrook, New Hampshire. Is that
*  near the border to Massachusetts? Because a lot of people did that. They like got places. I had
*  friends who got houses in New Hampshire because it was cheaper and you can get like a fucking yard
*  filled with bears. Yeah. New Hampshire's the woods bro. Is it? I did a girl from New Hampshire. Yeah
*  it's just over the border from Massachusetts. Yeah. Woods people. Woods people. Real woods people
*  are Maine people. There was one story that I was reading about where um these fucking guys were
*  working during construction in Maine and they rented a house and the neighbors had decided
*  that uh these people might have the corona and so they've been there since September. They had
*  they've been in the fucking town since September working on a construction site. So they chopped a
*  tree down and blocked their fucking driveway and threatened them with guns. They have to quarantine
*  them. They're forcing them to quarantine. Look at this. Group of local vigilantes try to forcibly
*  quarantine out of towners. That's Maine for you. That's fucked up. That's Maine for you. Dude Maine
*  is a strange place. It's a strange place. You ain't never seen drunk. Oh god. You never seen
*  drunk until you seen like a bar and Bangor. Those people could throw down and they're all in that
*  you know they're in that brutal brutal brutal cold brutal cold for a long time. They went to the
*  mainland. We're targeted because of license plate when they arrive back in Vinal Haven. Vinal Haven
*  an exchange between roommates and some local residents apparently didn't go well she said
*  adding that a group of local vigilantes decided to take matters into their own hands
*  and barricade these guys into their rental property.
*  Mrs. McDonald called the commotion a tremendous waste of resources noting that it had drawn a
*  response from several officials. So silly but that's Maine. There's a lot of dummies up there. A lot
*  of nice people. Don't get me wrong but you know there's a lot of dummies up there. They call
*  maniacs and they get real mad if you make fun of me. I had a guy screaming at me. I was telling
*  Maine jokes in Maine and he was screaming. He was standing up and he was an old dude too
*  pointing at me screaming like he really identified with Maine and I was trying to understand. I go
*  do you identify with Maine? Do you think I'm talking about you? What's going on here man? Why
*  are you mad? I was making fun of the number of people that were shot by deer in Maine.
*  Shot by deer? Or shot hunting deer and mistaken for a deer. Sorry shot by a deer. That's hilarious.
*  And I was making this joke about it like I mean how many fucking people live here and this guy
*  got up. I fucking live here screaming at me and I was like whoa buddy these are just jokes. It
*  doesn't make this a lot better but this thing in Maine it's a very it's a small island town.
*  Oh even worse. They're fucking trying to keep this weather saying get back to the mainland. I was
*  like why are they saying mainland? Because they're thinking someone came over there with the cooties.
*  But those guys have been there since September. These people are just idiots.
*  Dude islands are weird man. I did a gig once on Block Island. Block Island is like outside of
*  Rhode Island I believe. It was the worst gig I ever did. I mean even to this day I think back
*  I'm like you can't get worse. You only get different. The place was they were sedated.
*  What I mean sedated. I mean like everyone in the bar was plastered. Like at a level where they
*  couldn't even communicate. Wow. It was the it was one of the weirdest things I've ever seen.
*  Me and this kid Scott Papacuri he booked it. Me and him went there. He was the opener and I was
*  the closer. We both sucked and it was like 1989 and we were sleeping in a storage area. Like with
*  these containers of like fucking green beans and cans of peas. Try storage. Right there. Wow. So
*  there's like racks and on the ground there was like these beds and we had to sleep in these beds.
*  They were in a storage unit. I'm not bullshitting. There was no hotel room. There was a toilet. You
*  could take a shit. You could wash your hands. There was no bathroom. No shower. I was like this is the
*  craziest gig ever and they were mad at us because I forget what he had said but by the time he had
*  gotten off stage the show was basically over. They had shut the show down. I don't even remember if
*  I got to tell a joke. Wow. I don't even think I did. I think I might have like started my act and
*  they stopped everything like right as he was getting off stage and I didn't realize what was
*  going on but they didn't like his language or subject matter or whatever. It was for sure
*  mocking the drunks because they were like this. This fucking show sucks. I mean they were so drunk
*  dude like no one could sit up straight. Everyone was like that's why I'm saying they're like sedated.
*  And there was only maybe 20 people in the whole bar. I hate bar shits. And we came over there on a
*  ferry to do this terrible comedy show. So I was gonna ask seems like a place like putting bae.
*  Putting bae. Yeah we got stuck man. We couldn't go back. We had stuck. We couldn't go back until
*  the morning. And then we went back in the morning. I was like whoa that was a that was a rough one.
*  But that's an island. Like you get those people that just live on this little island and they
*  just get hammered together. Yeah there's a few of those islands. It's not a happy island. You
*  think of island life. You think of like Kauai. You know we're Laird Hamilton. Kauai. Is that Kiwa?
*  Is a serpent. Kauai. I know cold islands are not the same. No cold islands are different.
*  You don't get no Gabby Reese on them cold islands. I heard Hawaii didn't have any any coronavirus
*  and they closed off Hawaii. Is that true? They should. Good move for them. Shut it down if you
*  can afford it. Because people coming over they're going to bring it. The question is what if they
*  bring just you know what if they bring it and it doesn't affect them the way it affects everybody
*  else. They have a few cases. Up to 175. You heard about Germany? No. Exceptionally low mortality
*  rates like less than somewhere in the neighborhood of one tenth of one percent less than everywhere
*  else. Really? Yeah and then there's I believe Sweden and Sweden in an experiment they're not
*  shutting down anything. They're not shutting down yeah they're not shutting down restaurants
*  or schools or anything. I could go bad fast. Or not. Yeah how are they doing right now? Maybe
*  they're looking at it the same way Germany is looking at it. Yeah but the whole thing is over
*  filling the hospitals all at once and not being able to treat people. Right and that's why they
*  die because they don't get the right treatment. Right. Yeah yeah 100 percent. I mean there's no
*  fucking real answer to this thing. It's uh it affects people so differently. Some people get it
*  and it's almost nothing and some people apparently in Wuhan are testing positive again. So they test
*  negative. They get it. They get over it. They test negative. Then they test positive again but they're
*  asymptomatic. They're asymptomatic but it's it's still active. That's what people are scared of.
*  That it's going to be a certain percentage of the population for whatever reason. Aren't going to
*  show any signs of this virus and those people are going to spread it to everyone around them and not
*  even know they're doing it. But in a sense we kind of all are doing that. If you're around any people
*  that go anywhere other than at your house. Like if you go to the store. Like if you're going to the
*  store and we're all going to the store at Burrow. You don't know what you're running into. You're
*  going to the store. You know what I mean? You hopefully are not going to catch anything at the store but
*  this stuff lives in the air. People are breathing. If you just I don't know how much it takes. How much
*  particulate matter has to be in the air before it can get into your mouth. Oh look at you got. Yeah.
*  A bane mask. And it has the filters. Do you wear that when you fuck? Don't lie. Not anymore. Sounds
*  sexy anymore. I was lucky. I bought these things like before the virus because of allergies. Are
*  those good? Well this has like the the filters in it. The charcoal filters and all that. I don't know
*  if it does anything. Oh I'm sure the charcoal filters do a lot. Yeah. It has replaceable filters. Sounds good.
*  But it makes me feel better when I'm in public. Just like the other day I was at the grocery store
*  and of all people an old Chinese lady starts coughing ridiculous. And the whole grocery store
*  was quiet. All looked over at once. Just stared at her because she was not even like covering her
*  face. She was just coughing up in the air. Oh my god. And I was like thank god I had this. I pulled out
*  and it at least makes me feel better. Like but I think the particles fall directly to the ground.
*  Like they're a thicker water so it doesn't even matter. I was trying to get my family to watch
*  World War Z or 28 Days Later. They passed on both of them. I was like World War Z is rated PG.
*  It's PG-13. Yes. Shana the Dead's a good one. Yeah but World War Z is ferocious. Remember that?
*  That scared the shit out of me. I was listening to a podcast where they were talking about this guy
*  that got bit by a mountain lion that was rabid. And any animal that's rabid will be like real
*  aggressive and they'll go after you. Just think about that because it's kind of like what it is
*  to be a 28 Days Later zombie type character, right? You just want to bite people to give them
*  a disease. And that's kind of what like a rat who has rabies is trying to do. Chasing a cat. Yeah.
*  Or you know or you. Something like a raccoon trying to bite these people that I was reading about.
*  Like it turned out the raccoon had rabies. Like oh they once they when they have rabies they want
*  to give it away. They want to give it. That's what the virus is doing or the disease is doing.
*  It's trying to get in another host. So it makes you like go get them on and jump into them.
*  Imagine if something like that rage shit from 28 Days Later gets out.
*  It's so much scarier than what we're dealing with now folks. Again we have a good in comparison to
*  how it could be. Asteroid showers and rage all at once. Rage gets out of the lab. The chimp bites
*  the trainer. The trainer bites the doctor. The doctor bites the nurse. The nurse bites her friends.
*  And everybody starts biting everybody and that's 28 Days Later. Bro that's rabies. That could happen.
*  Why couldn't it happen? It can happen. No power. Asteroid shower. Grid goes down. No internet.
*  People start lying again. Jesus. And then rabies. I want you to feel good about today.
*  Right now we're doing good man. We can still get gas. We can still get food.
*  Yeah but like our internet's already stressed. They have to take down all the Netflix and video
*  games. They're going down like 720p. There's a thing called books. I want you to look into them.
*  I want you to start reading. Come on bro. Fuck that. Fuck that. Both of you? My internet went out
*  for a half hour last night and I almost freaked out. I've set some good fitness goals. That's what I
*  decided to. I set a real good schedule of shit that I need to do that I'm definitely going to do.
*  X amount of days per week and I've been on that. And I fucking love not traveling. You know? I mean
*  I'm sorry for everyone that's out of work. Don't get me wrong. I'm not being insensitive here. I'm
*  just telling you my life. The positive thing about not traveling is you feel way better.
*  Your body's not getting beat up all the time. Your body gets beat the fuck up when you travel
*  every weekend. You fly on a plane every weekend. That's positive because we had to cancel obviously
*  a bunch of shows and just being at home. God I love it. No stress. No stress. It's nice.
*  Petting your dog. Going for a walk in your neighborhood. All that shit's important for
*  people. And you don't realize because we have this crazy life where we're always flying around.
*  You don't realize how unsettling that is until you're home for a period of time. We should do
*  residencies in LA the way they do residencies in Vegas. I guess we kind of do already at the
*  Comedy Store. Like set up shop at a small theater. Just like I'm not going anywhere anymore. You want
*  to travel? We're doing shows in Burbank. We'll buy a 500 seat theater in Burbank. Do shows there every
*  weekend. There's one right across the street from Bob's Big Boy. Because you can travel. I don't
*  have to travel to you. You can travel. I'll make the tickets cheaper. Airlines are going to be so
*  cheap. When we get back and running, everyone's going to be like please fly. Please. We're hanging
*  on by a thread. Jeff Loos. Last night was the cheapest shit. Cheapest shit. Right? For flying
*  neck this weekend you could buy first class for under 500 bucks. That's crazy. Round trip to China
*  was 400 dollars. Round trip should be 400 dollars in your bank account. They should pay you.
*  They should give you foot massage the whole way and say they're sorry. Do you think that's
*  going to come though? They might shut down the airlines because that seems like a dumb thing.
*  I think Jeff Loos just put it out. Of course. They're flying around. That's what I was saying.
*  If you look at that cell phone map, we're doing a better job than those fucking kids are. Those
*  kids on the beach are doing the worst job because they're 17 and they're horny and they're drunk
*  and they have a phone. But if you just look at people that are traveling for business or people
*  that are going to supermarkets, if you just look at it honestly, there's so much room for it getting
*  out. I definitely think it's a good move to stay in as long as possible and get as many people that
*  are tested negative as possible so that we can save as many people as we can. Don't get me wrong.
*  But I am saying they're not really stopping it. They're stopping some of it. You're not 100%
*  stopping it. They're not going to be able to either. They were talking about quarantining
*  New York City and Cuomo had an interesting quote. It's almost like the federal government
*  declaring war on states and war on cities. I was like, whoa. If the federal government comes and
*  says nobody leaves and nobody goes in, oh fucking Christ, are we really doing that?
*  Cuomo's like, look, this is not a good thing to do. You bring in the military and have tanks and
*  shit. Everybody's freaking out about next step. What is next level when you say quarantine? Now
*  Trump is giving into this idea that it's going to take until April 30th. He's given up on his Easter
*  idea and now he's saying that doesn't look realistic. It looks more like April 30 just
*  for the personal space guidelines. He said June 1st right after that. He's like, June looks like
*  a great time. What about May? Yeah, what about May? Yeah, I think it's June 1st. Sounds like a way more
*  realistic thing then. Dude, imagine if everybody's out of work for three months. Do you know how nuts
*  that's going to be? All these people that had thriving businesses and through no fault of their
*  own, they lost all that they worked for for decades. All these people that are taking care
*  of their families, all these people that are raising kids, putting kids in school, putting
*  kids in daycare while they're at work, all that shit. There's so much of a disruption here
*  and no one knows what to do. No one has a solution. But people are blaming Trump.
*  Like man, what if he was right? What if we were on the bright side of this thing and they caught
*  it early and his rosy predictions proved true? That would be great. They weren't. But no one's
*  were. No one knew. I mean some people had a better idea than him for sure. But no one really knew
*  what was going to go on. And we're really still puzzled by some places. Like I was talking to
*  this guy that was saying there's a real issue with Italy because Italy's numbers are so out of whack.
*  You look at Germany and you look at Italy. Italy has crazy numbers. And they're trying to think
*  lifestyle. They're trying to think close proximity to family members. They're always on top of each
*  other. They live a lot of people to a place and they social gather all the time. And then
*  they're smoking. They smoke a lot of cigarettes. A lot of smoking. Yeah. And then there's also a
*  very high population of old people. So then they look at Germany. And this is why I always tell you
*  if you have a choice between an Italian car and a German car, you get a fucking German car all day.
*  Because Germans are very, very fucking disciplined. And they're structured and they think things out
*  and they engineer things well. And for whatever reason, whether it's because their hospital system
*  is better, whether it's because it's a genetic thing, whether it's because more people over there
*  have better health care and they get treated quicker, their mortality rate is really low.
*  It's weird. Have you read about Sweden? Did you find the thing about Sweden?
*  What are they saying about it? They have closed colleges and universities. They've limited
*  restaurants to like 50 people, but they are saying like people can eat in them.
*  Schools for kids under 16 are closed, but they haven't. It's like voluntary for everything else,
*  like voluntary lockdown. They're expecting people to make the right decision. That's their take on it.
*  What's that little thing you got there, fella? Just charger. Oh, I thought that was maybe one
*  of them weird phones. You know how they have those little baby ones? Well, they have those foldables.
*  Oh, I want one so bad. Do you though? I do. I want the, not the razor, but the Samsung one.
*  That one looks cool. Well, they have two Samsungs, one that folds like a clamshell.
*  Yeah, the clamshell. That's the move, right? Yeah. But you think you could be okay with Android?
*  I think it would be good as a second phone. The thing about Android, man, is those iMessage
*  group chats and FaceTime and AirDrop. AirDrop's huge. They're so wise. Like,
*  Apple did such a clever move in sucking us into their net. I like it, man. You can't get out like
*  this. Where the spider's web? Because I have a Samsung phone. I have a Galaxy Note 10. It's a
*  great phone. I like to use that for looking at stuff, like watching YouTube videos and stuff.
*  It's a huge screen. It's got no bezels, basically. And one little tiny hole punch in it. It's killer.
*  And the 5G's nice. It's nice, but I've never used it once. It's nice that it's there.
*  But the thing about it is it doesn't get AirDrop. If someone wants to send me a picture,
*  they have to text it to me. I might not even get it. The Samsung does, or I mean,
*  Android does have their version of AirDrop, but I can never get it to work. I don't think you
*  can do it to Apple, and Apple can't do it to them. Yeah, it's...
*  Fuck off.
*  I have no problems with the iPhone.
*  But it's just interesting that they figured out a way to do that, to rope us into their net.
*  Because if they didn't rope us into their net, then it's like, you could get a really good Android
*  phone now. Like, right now, they have that Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra. Have you seen that?
*  Yeah, that looks great.
*  That thing is a tablet. You're carrying around an iPad. It's huge.
*  That camera, though.
*  Oh my God. What is it, 108 megapixels?
*  Something like that, yeah.
*  That is so ridiculous. And then it has a 100x zoom. If you go to digital zoom,
*  it's like 3x optical and 100x digital.
*  I don't even think it's 3x optical. I think it's something like...
*  10x?
*  30x or something like that.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, because it uses a, like a periscope. Not periscope, oh.
*  Telescoping lens?
*  Yeah, it's like a mirror.
*  We're both morons. Listen to us.
*  We know what we're doing. We both know each other.
*  Yeah, I know what you're saying. But it's so big. I switched to the little iPhone.
*  I went to the little one.
*  Now, that's something I think in the future I'm going to start. Because I bought my girlfriend
*  the smaller version of the 11 Pro or whatever.
*  It's the best one.
*  And it's way better.
*  Yeah.
*  It doesn't sit weird in my pocket. That was the other thing. The big one in my front pocket,
*  it was like, first of all, what kind of radiation am I getting on my dick?
*  Yeah.
*  Lots. Making some weird fucking Dr. Strange kids.
*  But the other thing is like this thing fits. It's big enough. Like if I'm looking at shit,
*  it's fucking big enough. But it fits perfectly in your hand. You know, it's not too heavy.
*  I've been wearing my watch a lot lately and just leaving my phone at home because I have to.
*  You're a daredevil.
*  Because the number is connected. So if somebody calls me or texts me,
*  I get it on my watch. Except Android people, you're fucked.
*  Oh, that's right. They probably can call you. You have a cell phone chip.
*  Yeah, they can call me.
*  They can text you, but they can't iMessage you? Or does it get SMS as well?
*  Oh, I guess it does work on SMS. Yeah. What am I thinking?
*  My sister sends me these voice to text checks. And I guess she does it while she's driving.
*  And I'm like, do you ever read these? Like the worst interpretation of what you said.
*  There's no periods in any of it. And I looked through it. I'm like, what are you saying?
*  She just rambles into her phone and then sends me this text message. It's hilarious.
*  She's busy. She doesn't have time to read it. I get it. I'm not mad at her,
*  but I'm like, why in the hell? And then I said to her, I go, did you read this?
*  And she laughs at me. But it's so bad. You can't yet leave a whole conversation with somebody.
*  You can say a thing. It's pretty close.
*  Pretty close. You can leave a note. But when you want to make a long story.
*  First of all, my sister's from Boston. She's a Boston heavy Boston accent.
*  You should post this.
*  I had it when I was 19. I hurt myself on television. When I was 19, I fought in the
*  Bay State games and this local news station interviewed me. And I had this terrible accent.
*  I was like, oh my God, listen to me. I'm a moron.
*  Do you have that on video?
*  I wish I did. I don't have it anymore. There's a bunch of my old taekwondo day stuff that I
*  just wanted to shed when I was moving on with my life. The only reason it was a video of me
*  fighting at all, even online, even though I had videos, was because this guy that I knew from
*  back in the day, he was on another team. We knew each other back when we were both young and
*  competing, sent me this stuff. So this is the one video of me sending some guy flying through the
*  air. That's from him. He caught that in 1987 U.S. Cup in Connecticut.
*  Yeah. So I have the medals. I have a bunch of medals just sitting around. I look at them every
*  now and then and it seems like I'm lying. They don't even look like they're mine. They seem fake.
*  They seem fake. I think about the taekwondo days and I look at those things and I'm like,
*  those are mine. Is that really mine?
*  That's a planted memory, Joe. That didn't happen.
*  I don't have a real video of it other than that one video. The only time I know it's real is when
*  I kick the bag. I'm like, oh yeah, I can do this. It's some weird thing that I can still do.
*  You know, like you ever seen Chappelle do backflips? Chappelle Lacey? Not Dave Chappelle.
*  Chappelle Lacey.
*  What, Dave Chappelle can do a backflip?
*  Chappelle Lacey is like three Dave Chappelle's in the same height. If you like took Dave's body
*  and packed in through me, he's a fucking savage. He's so jacked and he's got ridiculous athletic
*  ability because of years of being a cheerleader. He's a world champion cheerleader. Dude, he throws
*  himself through the air and you cannot believe it because he's a tank. He's probably 230,
*  somewhere around in that range, solid rock and flips through the air. Throws himself through
*  the air. Just backflips in the back. Look at this. Watch this. This is him. Oh, okay. It'll
*  replay. Watch this. Watch. Oh, that's him. Watch this. Watch this. This is ridiculous, dude.
*  Holy shit. It doesn't seem possible to do that.
*  But if you're tiny, if you're a 135 pound person, that's one thing. He's, I mean, no bullshit,
*  a solid 235, 240. Built like a brick shithouse. Well, he throws this girl up in the air and
*  catches her over his head. Look at that. That's ridiculous. It's ridiculous.
*  He's a cheerleader?
*  He was a, there's no real professional, but he was a competitive world champion cheerleader.
*  What were we just talking about? Why did I bring him up?
*  God damn this weed. But before the backflip. Dave Chappelle. No, before that. God damn it.
*  We're talking about people. No, no, it was past that. We're talking about people who can do crazy
*  things physically. That's probably what it is that you wouldn't expect. You're like, what? How do you
*  do that? But it's the same thing with him. Like he started doing that when he was really young.
*  So his body developed, throwing itself through the air. But a normal person, his size,
*  it's so hard to get air when you're that heavy. Those guys who get air, if you see them at like
*  a, like a gymnastics event, they're like 160, 170. Watch this. That's crazy. Dude. I mean,
*  he flies through the air. It's like you kicking a bag. Like, you know, it's kind of like that in that
*  he's doing this because he developed his body while doing this. And when he was real little
*  by himself, he used to practice like doing backflips and shit. So by the time he got into
*  cheerleading, he was already like physically capable of doing that. He grew up doing it.
*  And when your body grows up doing something, we used to say that about strikers, some strikers,
*  some people learn how to strike. They can learn how to strike later in life. They still pick it
*  up pretty well just because they're real fast and explosive. But there's a thing that like guys have
*  when they start out striking at a very early age, like Floyd Mayweather is a perfect example.
*  They're the really elite of the elite seem to all start out when they're young and sort of develop
*  into fighting as their body matures like Tyson, like Sugar Ray Leonard, like a lot of these guys
*  had extensive amateur backgrounds, and then you know, developed into a male professional with,
*  you know, some of them 100 plus fights in the amateurs like Vasily Lomachenko had hundreds and
*  hundreds of fights in the amateurs and won, I think two Olympic gold medals before he ever
*  became professional. And those guys that they're just head and shoulders above everybody else.
*  Because like developing as your body's maturing, and you're being coached by world class coaches
*  like Floyd Mayweather was, like you just get this sense of the sport that other people are never
*  going to get. They're never going to get to your level. You're just on this crazy level. The only
*  way they're going to beat you is if they catch you with like a perfectly placed punch with anybody
*  can get hit with you get knocked out. But other than that, if it's just like boxing for boxing,
*  Floyd Mayweather is like, he's a Zen master. He's got this sense of the sport that most guys just
*  will never have. Like when you if you watch him fight, a lot of people like they hate on him
*  because he talks a lot of shit, he's got a lot of money, and he wants everybody to know it. But
*  that's also he sells pay per views dummy. Like he talks a lot of shit, you get mad, you want to see
*  him get beat, but nobody can beat him. But when he fought Canelo Alvarez, that was a real wake up
*  call for people because Canelo is a monster. He's a terrifying boxer. And for me, whether just
*  piece him up, piece them up, just piece them up, just put on show put on a boxing clinic and you
*  watch him like, wow, that's a he has a special understanding of that sport. But I don't think
*  you get if you start when you're 30. I don't think you ever get there. I think you need to be already
*  elite in your 20s. If you want to get to your peak as a 30 32 year old athlete somewhere in that range,
*  you know, at the top of the game at the apex, you kind of need to learn as you're a baby. You know,
*  yeah, it's a fucking weird thing, man. When we get old, we suck at learning things. You know,
*  it's nature's way of telling you, bitch, pick a lane. Pick something tick tock. Get out of here.
*  Like have you once last time you tried to learn a new thing like a new skill?
*  Uh, well, or a language reading, learning PC. Are you relearning PC? Yeah, games, virtual reality.
*  And it's, I tell you, it's frustrating as fuck. Like, just had to download a program the other
*  day just to put a 3d model in just so I could upload it into a game. And like, it's like just
*  the, you know, it's so not like Mac, it's it's it's it's you have to actually dig in and like,
*  do code stuff and do you have to enter DOS? I was doing whatever their terminal. Yeah,
*  I think it is. Yeah, you did that. I did something like that. Yeah. You did the command Unix or
*  whatever it's called. Unix is a that's what program Apple's based on. Is it? Yeah. Apple's
*  based on Unix, right? Mac OS. It used to be a base, but Windows isn't Unix, right? You know,
*  a different program. I had to download a program just to put this 3d model in. And I think it's
*  so you can download a Unix program on Windows. Yeah. In Mac. I don't do shit with my Windows
*  computer other than write. Right. It's my writing. That's your writing computer? Yes. Yes. It's so
*  it's to me it's you know, it's so much sloppy. There's so many windows popping up still. There's
*  so many like dumb things. Like, why are you asking me this? You know, once update all the time. Yeah.
*  And when it updates, it'll take like 20 minutes. Mike, you fucker. He didn't tell me how long it
*  was gonna take. Now I'm sitting here my dick in my hand. Yeah. Trying to write. I've heard a lot
*  of people complain about the Apple update thing too. Because most people don't hit the update now
*  unless like no tomorrow, no tomorrow. It keeps getting after you. Well, those people are stupid.
*  It's a different animal. We're talking about morons. But it's but for writing, man, you cannot if you
*  want to just have a laptop, you can't beat those ThinkPads. Those Lenovo ThinkPads, the keyboards
*  are so much better. It makes such a big difference. It's the whole difference. It's the whole
*  difference. Because if I looked at it in terms of like the quality of the screen, and the the with
*  the Mac ecosystem, once you're in that ecosystem, like everything's sort of connected to your laptop.
*  But the keyboard on those Lenovo's is like telepathic, like you know where every key is,
*  your fingers fit in that little groove. And when you push them down, there's like the satisfying
*  amount of travel. And you know where you know what you're doing. I make so fewer errors than I do
*  even with the new one. I got that 16 inch one, the new one, it still sucks. Yeah, it's still sucks.
*  It's better for sure than the last keyboard. It's way better than way better, way better. But it
*  still sucks. Why wouldn't you make the best keyboard ever? Why would you make a keyboard
*  that still sucks? When you know that those Lenovo keyboards are out there, you know they're out
*  there. Somebody must have told you. Somebody must have told you that there's a ThinkPad keyboard
*  that's literally 500 times better than your shitty keyboard. Or just the one they had two years ago.
*  Like I get my ex or my girlfriend. Yeah, I get my girlfriend my old computer and and I was playing
*  on that keyboard. I'm like, this is way better than the 16 inch. Like why are we using this?
*  Key travel. Yeah. Back then you had more key travel. Yeah, dude, I have that 17 inch that
*  that has refurbished load. Yes, has a fuckload of key travel. Right. I know where every key is,
*  and I press them. They took the guts out and put a new gut in. That's SSD drive. Yes. But when you
*  press those keys, man, there's a satisfying amount of travel. It lets you know you're pressing it.
*  And that's more feedback for your fingers. So you're more confident when you're typing.
*  When everything's flat, the same surface like, ew. Yeah. Ew. Like how good do you type on an iPad
*  when you have to open it up as a keyboard and you do that? Ew. Ew. Get out of here. No, no, no,
*  that new iPad keyboard. Have you seen that? That's different. That looks sick. That does look sick.
*  But then what is that? Is that an iPad or a fucking computer? Right. What is that? Well,
*  it's faster than their Mac Airs or whatever. Yeah, I guess it's faster. This is my thought. When
*  you're going to use a computer, shouldn't it be comfortable and shouldn't it be most effective to
*  use? Like, aren't those two, you think about the amount of time you spend entering things into a
*  keyboard. Shouldn't it be the most comfortable keyboard you can get and the keyboard that
*  responds the best? Shouldn't it be? Okay. Well, how is that not a giant priority for you? You want
*  everything to look pretty, but you want it to feel like shit. And so even when you know that more
*  travel is better for people that type, especially if you're touch typists and people who write a lot
*  and creative people, you know that. Why don't you do that? Well, I think that's kind of why people
*  like iPads, because you can bring your own keyboard. And you can do that with a laptop too,
*  for sure. But it's still why not do it right? Like Lenovo does, you fucks. And by the way,
*  metal doesn't feel good. Like, why is it metal? Why am I putting my hand on metal? Why is it cold
*  metal digging into my wrists? Why is it aluminum? Why you want to make it pretty? Like, why don't
*  you make it out of like a softer plastic with curved edges so it doesn't suck? So it doesn't
*  feel weird on your skin? Curved edges, for sure. We want everything. Why are you laughing?
*  You're so deep down in the design discussion meeting. I'm like picturing of like,
*  Mike, what do you want? You want it to be thinner? I want it to be a ThinkPad. ThinkPad X1 carbon.
*  It weighs nothing. That one was curved. The old 17 inches curved. When they made that unibody design.
*  That edge will still cut you up. That edge when you're typing, that edge at the bottom,
*  that cuts you up. It's stupid. The first thing I would cut if I was just like, hey, we need to
*  make a new design, I would just shave the keys in half, because they're probably taking up making
*  the double. You know, when you close it, I think that's what they're trying to shrink down, right?
*  When you close it, shave the keys in half. How would you do that? What do you mean? Like the piece
*  of plastic that they are that you're saying that made them so much better when you're shrinking
*  the size of a laptop's profile. Well, that's what happened. So you can close it. That's all I'm
*  saying. Like they just probably did that first and no one give a fuck. Well, they came out with a
*  patent that they haven't implemented yet of a keyboard that has keys that lower or raise.
*  And this was like something that was being discussed. Like they were thinking, oh, that
*  would be great if Apple had it. Like you can get it up to 1.5 millimeters or down to like 6
*  millimeters or 0.6 millimeters, if that's what you want. But it's still going to be not as good as
*  the Lenovo one. They're not going to know when it's curved. The Lenovo one, there's like they're
*  little C shapes. So your fingers fit right into them and you know where each one is. It's just
*  better. Like why don't you know it's better? Anyone who types on it knows it's better. You know,
*  Louis from Unbox Therapy. Dude, as soon as he started typing on one, he's like,
*  what have I been doing with my life? You should get one of those Lenovo laptops and hackintosh it.
*  I don't use it for enough. It's like, what do I need? I need Microsoft Word. I need, I used to
*  use RightRoom a lot, but now I find I can do all the same shit with Word. And then I upload,
*  you know, when I share it with myself so that I have it on my other computer.
*  But that's all I'm doing with it. I'm writing, you know, like it's okay. I know the operating
*  system is more clunky. It's weird, but I'm, I don't do anything with it. You know, if I was
*  running a bunch of different programs and I'm just using it as a word processor, mostly, it's just
*  way better. It's way better to write on and it weighs nothing. These fucks, they keep giving us
*  the same thing. Here's your choice, aluminum or aluminum. I think it's going to get worse too. I
*  think the future is having no keyboard, having it like an iPad with the haptic feedback. I feel like
*  that's probably going to be it. Yeah. Well, I think people, there's still a group of people that
*  like really want those mechanical keyboards, you know, and a lot of people hook up mechanical
*  keyboards to their main desktop computer anyway, you know, they just feel better. There's more
*  travel, you know, where you know what's going on. Once you get accustomed to that, God damn it,
*  you don't make any errors. You know where each key is, your fingers sort of fall into place.
*  I mean, if you're a way better typist than me and many, many, many people are,
*  maybe that keyboard is not as bad. But for me, that keyboard sucks, you know, especially the old one,
*  the new one's better. The new 15, 16 is better than the old 15 for sure. No doubt about it,
*  but it still sucks. They had, they have a lot of questionable design. Like one of the biggest
*  design dumb things that Apple's ever done. Like I thought they would have fixed it by now,
*  but their might, their mouse, how you have to charge it on the bottom, the plug to charge it
*  is on the bottom of it. So say like you're out of battery, you can't just like plug it and use it
*  like a mouse while it's charging. It pretty much uses it or makes it, you can't use it at all.
*  So you can't use it while it's charging? Yeah. The plug, well, I guess this is an old one.
*  Oh, it plugs under it. So you have to open it up and get in there. No, no, no, you have to
*  plug it right here. So it's on the bottom. So you can't even use it. Like if you just need to hit
*  enter or something or whatever, it's the dumbest design ever made. They still have it like that?
*  Why don't they just have it at the end? So you could use it like a regular mouse when it's charging.
*  They want you to be responsible and charge your mouse. They shouldn't ask you to be responsible
*  for that. Like what if something's important and you want to enter it right away? You can't do it.
*  Yeah. And why, why does iPad not have multiple users, like a computer? So if you want to give
*  your wife your iPad, you could log, let her log into her own account so you don't have all
*  your shit open. Oh, it doesn't? No. Oh, I didn't know that. How, how are they not added multiple
*  logins? But they do that with laptops. But they do it with laptops. Well, that's the difference
*  between Mac OS and iOS, right? iOS is used for phones. But that's easily fixable. Yeah, but they're
*  worried. They're about to be all the same thing soon. We don't know when, but I hope so. Jesus.
*  There's going to be OS. Do you think you would ever, see the thing about Apple though, they're
*  way better with privacy, way better with privacy than Google phones. Oh yeah. You know, like I was
*  reading this thing about Android phones where there's some apps that send information to other
*  apps. They have agreements where apps contact other apps and let those apps know what you're doing.
*  Yeah. That's how they got all that data for that thing I showed you. It didn't come from nowhere.
*  Well, that, that news Zoom. Yeah, good point. That new Zoom software everyone's using, like even if
*  you don't sign in using Facebook or say anything about Facebook, you're still getting your shit
*  sold to Facebook. Like how is that possible? It's crazy. Well, it's commodity. You know,
*  it's a commodity and there was a great guest on the Sam Harris podcast. I wish I could remember
*  it, but this guy was talking about privacy and this very thing. He's like, there became a commodity
*  that we didn't know was going to be a commodity and we all sold our rights away to it. We all signed
*  the user agreement. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Click agree. Send it. Come on, let me get going. I just want
*  to use it. I don't, I don't want to pay attention to what that fucking user, maybe you want seven,
*  eight pages of legalese. You're like, what am I agreeing to? Yeah. You know, those end user
*  agreements, man, those are one of the sneakiest things that people have ever perpetrated on folks.
*  That South Park episode, by the way, don't you, don't you wish South Park was going on right now?
*  I know. If I was Trey, I would be like, dude, let's just do this. You know,
*  probably writing. Yeah, it's probably constantly writing anyway. They'll probably have like five
*  episodes ready to go by the time everything gets running. I hope so. Five Corona episodes.
*  I wish what's going on right now. They'd probably be the most fucked up. Oh my God.
*  Comedy Central think they had a hard time when they were drawing Mohammed.
*  How, what kind of a hard time are they going to get from the Corona virus? Yeah.
*  Yeah. And how bad is comedy going to be for a couple months when people,
*  comics start getting back on stage? Cause you know, at being, no one's been working out,
*  you know, this it'll be fine in a week. Yeah. Not even depending if you listen to your
*  recording recordings, right? Yeah. If you listen to recordings, you could, you could get going.
*  I had a dream that I was in the middle of a bit and I forgot how to do it. Oh fuck. Yeah.
*  It was like a bit that I don't do anymore. So it was even weirder, but it was in the middle of a
*  bit. I was like, God damn it. How's this big? Oh, I forgot. But if I was going to go up,
*  when this is all down and we're back up and running, I'm going to do short spots at the store and get
*  the legs under you again. You're down for a couple months. Yeah. Does it all the time.
*  Everyone's going to have Corona jokes though. It's so gross. That's why South park needs to
*  come out right now. Yeah. Comedians are going to have the hot take is going to be so similar.
*  Like what's the hot take going to be? There's going to be, Hey, don't eat a fucking bat.
*  It's going to be that one. There's going to be jokes about a Dulce keys or Modelo is going to
*  be jokes about that. So it was the real obvious one. Yeah. There's going to be, uh, there's going
*  to be mean people that are going to make jokes about headed to work. Fuck granny toilet paper.
*  You know, I need to pay my fucking rent. How about you stay home granny, you know,
*  there's going to be those people that have that take on it. It's going to be fun.
*  It's going to be interesting to see like if anybody has a perspective that you didn't think
*  a lot of comics are hitting to like IG live right now. And it's, it's God awful. I cannot stand it.
*  The weirdest thing is comics that thought it was a good idea to do stand up with no crowd
*  in front of the lab factory. Oh, do you see those? Yeah. Or flappers who's charging $5 a person to
*  go on their pay site or some flats. Yeah. Flappers out of control as usual, some virtual open mic,
*  five bucks to get on their virtual open mic. Yeah. That they had charged for people digitally.
*  You got to do what you got to do in a way. I say, Hey, they got to stay open.
*  You know, nobody is more willing to give you money than some crazy open mic or that wants
*  to be seen. Right. Right. Especially some of the legit job, like most of them have a job and then
*  they do stand up on, you know, their spare time. So you got a little disposable income probably
*  because they're crazy and they have no friends. Right. So they're not spending on anything other
*  than medication. The next thing you know, boom, five bucks for flappers and they hit them. What
*  if it was like one dude who bought the whole block? Oh, that's hilarious. Yeah. One open
*  mic or who bought the whole day. We could just ask on YouTube and do it all day. No, no, no.
*  He wants the prestigious flappers brand behind him. And so he does it. He just dominates
*  flappers website all day. There was a, a standup video game a few months ago. I don't know what,
*  how do you remember comedy night or something? Like you can go into a place and like take,
*  take your turn doing, I think maybe if you got boot off, like the Apollo, you're done. And the
*  next person goes up. Well, I think Grand Theft Auto was supposed to originally have that be
*  the comedy store, be a comedy club that you can go into. That would be cool. I wish he would do
*  that. Hey, did you see those people singing along to Biggie in Brooklyn? It wasn't real.
*  Thought so. Yeah. My wife is the first person who knows nobody's leaning out the windows.
*  No, this is a crowd voice you could hear. It's like from an arena. God damn it. Tell it right away.
*  What was it? Sons of bitches. They pretended Dana White, they got him. They got a lot of people.
*  Got Jamie Foxx. Yeah. Yeah. I was like, that's pretty cool. If they did do it, if someone was
*  blasting Biggie and everybody starts singing along, but nope, that's a lay face. Fucks.
*  Well, it's because of the Italians actually did do it, you know, in that apartment complex. And
*  they're all singing into the, well, they, you could see them singing though. But this one lady came
*  outside and she was playing the recorder and her husband fucking smacked it out of her hand.
*  They did a concert last night. What is a thing? Fox, Fox news, something that was like being
*  broadcast live, but almost all of those videos are being lip synced and whatnot.
*  Oh boy. It was real, but like I was watching, you could see it was fake.
*  I'll never smoke weed with Willie again.
*  Yeah. That's what, that's gotta be a bummer, man. Imagine if you went on stage to do stand up
*  and they wanted you to lip sync your old shit. Imagine if they had like an album that you did
*  and you had a lip sync to the album, including the ad libs.
*  And you, has anybody ever tried maybe because they lost their voice or something and got,
*  you know, like the way that Ashley Simpson did it on SNL and got busted.
*  I never heard of it. Can you imagine comics doing that?
*  That's what I'm asking for. That's what he's saying. That's crazy.
*  Yeah. I could imagine some crazy people doing it. Like some people that are really off,
*  people do some dumb shit. I can imagine, you know,
*  we have this random thing. I forgot. I don't know if I ever told you this on kill Tony
*  or we'll have Joe Rogan calling in and, and it's just me on Spotify going, all right,
*  what are we talking about? Gaze. All right. Click on gaze and just go, let's go 10 minutes,
*  10 seconds into the, and just press play. Like Joe, what's going on? We just randomly
*  hit you saying things and when it works, it's the funniest.
*  Oh, that's hilarious. That's I'm a soundboard. No,
*  random. No, sometimes it doesn't work.
*  So you guys are still doing, you're still doing kill Tony.
*  Yeah, we're doing it tonight. We're doing it a lot of phone ins and call ins, you know,
*  it's mostly just me, Tony and Jeremiah. It's a good move to keep doing it, man,
*  because these are going to be, first of all, when people look back, they're going to look back at
*  these shows where you guys were on, you know, downtime and you're like, these motherfuckers
*  are committed to this show that even though they're completely quarantined, you can't do
*  any live shows. They did all their shows by themselves, no live show and you'll keep all
*  your audience. Yeah. Yeah. It's very cool too, that when they made this stay at home order,
*  they included podcasts as being essential. So it's very cool.
*  Or media. Or media. Yeah.
*  Very important. Yeah. And you know, yeah, we're all safe. We're not high fiving and kissing each
*  other like we normally do, but and it does feel good to do like me and Holtzman still are doing
*  the podcast and it's people like it because, you know, they're so depressed at home and,
*  you know, seeing us not freaking out and just having a conversation like we're doing right now,
*  it's like, oh, maybe I need to chill out a little bit. You know, they do, but also some shit needs
*  to change. Yeah. I don't know what can change though, man. I mean, what can you watch that video
*  with those fucking cell phones spreading across and think about the virus is spreading across.
*  How can you lighten things up and still keep people from getting infected? That's the great
*  question. And why do some people have almost no reaction to it? Why are some people asymptomatic?
*  That's the scary thing about new diseases, man. You know, when something new comes along,
*  they're all they're like, what is this? It's one thing I like about this.
*  I don't have to give anybody my joint. Hold on. I think that's the future or glass tips. Get your
*  own bitch. Even glass tips. Who knows what kind of spittles inside that fucking disgusting thing.
*  Blue light. And through the new glass tip. Fuck out of here. Yeah. The fuck out of here.
*  Bong hits. Oh, how about the fucking member that vaporizer bag we used to have the volcano.
*  volcano. Oh my God. Will we get obliterated with that? That was funny. You still have that?
*  Yes. kept it storage. Do you see that bong that was like 10 feet tall? That was.
*  Yeah, I gave that somebody. Fuck. Did I give that to? Oh, no. I gave it to somebody.
*  Maybe Tony's got it or someone. I got a head too many bongs. I never used any of them. I think
*  it was beautiful though. Oh, that crazy sculpture one. I used that one because it was so beautiful.
*  So ridiculous. It was like a piece of art. Yeah. But that just happened to get you high.
*  That was nice. Eddie and I, that was like the early days of my pot smoking too. And I thought
*  it was a good idea to have some ridiculous sculpture, some ode to weed in my living room.
*  Yeah. You had that cool media room. The gold Buddha. Such a weird time right now that I
*  keep thinking of what it's going to be like on the other end. Instead of just living,
*  which I've never really do, I never really think what's it going to be like on the other end.
*  I always just do stuff. Like whether I'm doing a Netflix special or whether I'm doing podcasts
*  or doing standup, I just do stuff. I don't think like, Oh, like do it like this. One day it'll be
*  that. And then maybe people will like this and maybe they'll, I just keep doing it. But now I'm
*  like, what is going to be here? Like what, what is society going to be like with no restaurants?
*  What is society going to be like with 50% unemployment? What is society going to be
*  like if that disease kicks in again? And what's going to survive? So I'm wondering about the
*  future now. I never wonder about the future. I was just kind of do. I'm so lucky now. I realized
*  so, so lucky that I can do that, that I could just concentrate on the shit I enjoy doing.
*  And that the big advantage of that too, is it helps you be good at that thing. Cause you have
*  less stress, you have less things you're thinking about more sleep for everybody. But now everybody's
*  got to be a prepper. Everybody's got to be a little paranoid. Everybody's got to be a little,
*  a little whacked out by this. Everybody does. Even people like you and I, they would want to
*  just blow it off and live in the moment. Now you can't now you have, especially if you have
*  people you love that are relying on you. Like you have to have food now. You have to keep food
*  in your fucking house. Fine toilet paper. That was a weird one. It is weird. I'm glad I have a bidet.
*  Why didn't everybody go crazy for food? Why everybody worry about wiping their ass? Why is
*  that the number one thing that seemed to be the issue? More than water. Like water makes
*  more sense in toilet paper. Water makes a ton of sense. And so does food, like dry food. Get oats,
*  get oatmeal, shit like that, rice, stuff that lasts a long ass time. You need pasta. You need
*  stuff that you could just make with a fire and a pan and some water. You need to be able to just
*  have stuff that'll keep you alive for X amount of days. That's what you need. You don't need
*  toilet paper. You need a rag and a sink and there you go. You got a clean asshole. Ta-da.
*  Or get one of them ones that we got in here. Squirty up the booty hoses thing. They have a new
*  one that was a sponsor that you can attach to the back of a toilet. It's not expensive either.
*  Oh yeah. What is that called? Tushy? Tushy. How much does that cost? It's very reasonable.
*  It starts off at $79. Yeah. So for 80 bucks you get a clean asshole and you save a million dollars
*  on toilet paper. And it takes like three minutes to install and it's the same water that you brush
*  your teeth with. Perfect. Goes right into the sink after you clean your asshole. No. No, it's not that
*  water. No, no, no. I mean it's the same water. It's real water. That was on the reed and that
*  was my favorite thing to say. It's the same thing. That's cleaning your butthole. The warm water one
*  is only $30 more. Oh, splurge folks. Unless you're a hard ass. Unless you're one of them Navy SEAL
*  type dudes who likes to suffer. Yeah. Yeah. You could, and if you decide to get a more expensive
*  one, you can skip the air drying one because it just makes the whole place smell like your asshole.
*  It's disgusting. I don't like the air dryer. I went over this person's house once and they had a
*  bidet and inside their bidet was a bar. So I was going to take a leak. There's a bar of soap and a
*  wet rag. And I was like, ew, what? Ew. Ew. Cause that's how you use it. You get in there with that
*  soap, you wash the old poop chute and that water shoots out. The bidet is like the most
*  un-ergonomically friendly thing that's ever been designed ever. It's basically if you fall and slip,
*  something happens and you got like slippery socks on or shoes, you fall. That pipe is going
*  right up your asshole. That stupid pipe. It's in the middle. How do you fall? People fall all the
*  time. Jamie, people die trying to climb fences. Do you know that? Those spikes on fences kill
*  people every year. Coconut is not there. You slip on fall and fall in the bidet and it punctures
*  your asshole like a robot dick. Think about what that thing looks like. It looks like the top of
*  a hammer. The one we got, it doesn't come out until you hit the button. It's like a little robot arm.
*  That's different. That's different, but it's not a bidet. I'm talking about a bidet. No, no, no,
*  no, no. That's a bidet seat. A real bidet. You're like, what? That's why it didn't make sense to you.
*  Like you're talking like the real...
*  Yeah.
*  These folks, it was a French doctor and his wife. We were over their house. They were French and
*  they had this bidet. It looks like if you slip, you're getting your butthole cleaned by this
*  little fucking pipe that's sticking straight up. It sprays water and you're supposed to get up in
*  there with soap, wash it down. That's the way to do it though. Better than the way we do it,
*  all smearing and everything. There it is. So that one's a, that's a safe one. Some of them,
*  some of them have a protuberance. You used to have one like that, right? Yeah. Some of them, yeah.
*  No, no, what is that? That's a broken toilet. That is not a bidet. Jesus Christ, son.
*  I'm trying to find one. Yeah, I'm trying to find one that sticks out more.
*  All right. I'm going to give up here. What did that circle, look at that, that the drawing to the
*  left with the red circle. Click on that. Oh wait, you're talking about... See these look small.
*  Maybe someone's a cruel person that had the house that I was in. Yeah, maybe it was one of those
*  douche sticks. I know when I used to date that porn star, she used to have the anal douche pole.
*  Maybe he was. That's a lot of work right here. Jesus, that's a hose. Look at this one. Wow.
*  I was in New York once and I posted it on Instagram. The shitter had not one but two
*  hoses. Had a hose on either side. I didn't get it. I didn't get it either. So someone explained to
*  me that some, because it was a very fancy hotel, and some people from other lands prefer to wash
*  their hand, wash their ass rather with their left hand. It's the lefty style. So for you to ask them
*  to grab a hose on the right hand side and hose down their asshole, they'd be offended. You're
*  not supposed to do that with your right hand, you're supposed to do it with your left hand.
*  Yeah, two. And one on each side. Like an industrial strength. I see. I think I'm making a YouTube
*  video or an Instagram video. Huh. Yeah, it's a better way to clean your ass, that's for sure.
*  The way we do it with toilet paper is really disgust though. It's fucking gross. You're just
*  smooshing it around. If you had that shit on your eyebrow, not your taint hairs, but your eyebrow
*  hairs, how much rubbing? There it is. One on the left, one on the right. What the fuck, dude? Look
*  at that. I like that. Did you try it out? Yes. With much shame. Was there poop juice everywhere?
*  Look at that one, man. That one's for a big asshole. Maybe one's for a pussy and one's for
*  an asshole. Maybe you double jam. I thought it was just to clean the toilet. Right hammers the clit.
*  Because my bidet has a pussy mode and an ass mode. Girls probably use that thing. It feels
*  good on your butt. I'm not ashamed to admit it. Have warm water squirts up on your butt. I guess
*  it's a smaller little thing than I remembered. So I don't think you have to worry though,
*  the bidet. There's a bidet on the other side of the room too. Look, if you see there, over there,
*  there's a bidet. So there was a bidet. See, that's what I'm talking about. See that little robot
*  sticking up? Did you see it in the bidet? Watch. See, watch when they turn it around or when I turn
*  it around, after I grab a hold of these two things. I was super confused. The other side has a thing
*  that pokes out in the middle and that's kind of what I was talking about. And some of them are a
*  little higher than others. But they're these weird little... There it is. I just, I don't,
*  what kind of shits are these people taking? This is a shower, this is a regular toilet, and then
*  a bidet. There it is. That little robot dick. Not that part, the other one, the one earlier. See,
*  it doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter. You don't have a touch bar on that laptop, do you?
*  Touch bar is the shit because even in an Instagram video, you can back it up and rewind it. She's
*  going to say they need to add a fucking play bar. Oh, they do that with a touch bar? Yes, you can.
*  I turned all that shit off. Oh, no, no, no. It's great. That's the only good thing about the
*  16-inch MacBook that I appreciate is that touch bar. For YouTube videos, you scroll back and forth.
*  It's so much better than having to keep your finger on this one area on the trackpad and hold onto
*  the thing and move it left and right or click on this, click on that. It's so seamless. You know
*  exactly where your finger is. It's a more effective way of navigating YouTube videos. Your track of
*  landscape that you're navigating in is very defined. So you just get your finger on it. You
*  can just move it back and forth. It's the shit. Nobody ever uses them. There's a bunch of keyboard
*  shortcuts on YouTube to use, which are great and helpful, but I couldn't tell you what more than
*  two of them are. I can skip frames. Are they listed somewhere? You can skip five seconds. Yeah,
*  they're listed a bunch of places, but you can jump to all sorts of parts in the video just by
*  hitting certain keys. I didn't know that. Yeah, save a bunch of time, but no one's going to
*  ever remember them or use them. They should open up gyms. When do you think they should do that?
*  Let people work out. Social distancing and proper cleaning, it seems like they should be able to do
*  that. They should only open up gyms for people who never contact anyone who contacts old people.
*  You have to sign a contract. Cleans after themselves at the gym. I mean, it seems like
*  that's the dirtiest place ever. Gross people spitting on the floor. They want to go back.
*  What kind of disgusting virus carrying solution is sweat from some dude who didn't shower today,
*  went straight to Gold's, fucking popped up, ready to get my PR in? Or PB, personal best,
*  personal record. PR, personal record, right? Yeah. You got to know those terms, bro.
*  Have you thought about doing anything special? It's like now that you know you have to be locked
*  down, it's a good time to work on something. Well, I've been really getting into broadcasting VR.
*  I'm learning how to do it the best way. I'm into VR, man. I think that's the future and
*  these new games coming out. Let me ask you this. Can you broadcast you playing Half-Life? Yeah,
*  I do it. I've done five broadcasts on my YouTube page. I'm trying to get it so I could have my
*  whole body in there, maybe in the future, but that takes a lot of work. Broadcasting
*  HD VR in Half-Life in a game like that would be fucking amazing.
*  When you think about how many people play games, they can figure out a way. You know,
*  you watch someone play and it's real similar. Like if you remember back in the Quake days,
*  we'd watch demos. Like if a really good player was playing, I'd watch like there's this dude
*  named Thresh. I've talked to him on the podcast before. I watched all his demos. He was just so
*  around. He's around. Yeah. He and I exchanged the messages way back in the dip, but it was obviously
*  before this Corona. Step one of what you're saying. Yeah, this is like step one, but you could see her
*  butt and in real life, you would be her. Yeah. This is what I'm trying to do at my house right now.
*  And it's hard to do because you have to have a lot of green screen crap. That's cool. This is cool.
*  Like that is it would be interesting to see someone walk through in third person, but I'm
*  talking about his first person. I know, I know. Dude, that would be the shit. This is this game
*  allows you to place a virtual camera for the purpose of doing this in there. So like without
*  doing that, you can have the headset vision of it. Oh, you can't. Yeah, I did the headset.
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying is like when people watch you play a game, they're going to want to
*  watch you survive some crazy VR like fantasy game like Half Life. Yeah, like that would be
*  really captivating because it's one thing to watch a guy play a game. But if you could put the VR
*  goggles on and watch with him and you're looking around and I'm seeing what you're seeing. Holy
*  fuck, dude. This guy's on. Sorry, the commercial. Sorry. Oh, Jesus. Scare me. I'm like, that's really
*  that's really realistic. Super realistic. People doing that, though. What are the good? What are
*  those other good other good series that are out? I know Amazon's has some good series now. People
*  are saying, yeah, well, I've you know, that tiger thing I highly recommend. But I'm definitely going
*  to see that. But I want to see something that's fake. Devs. Devs. Oh, that's right. That's Amazon.
*  That's Amazon. That's Hulu. Hulu. That's really good. That one actor, the guy from Parks and Rec,
*  what's his name? The comedian guy. He is great, man. He's in Devs. Yeah, he's one of the main guys.
*  He's the Steve Jobs guy. And that's in Westworld's back. I don't know if you ever got. Dude,
*  I liked Westworld, but the wife got a little grossed out and started pulling people's heads up. I know.
*  Yeah. Don't stay away from the spoilers. They're everywhere. Well, yeah, Westworld's not in the
*  West anymore. No, no, not Westworld. I mean, Ozark. Ozark spoilers. People are binge watching,
*  like instantly. People are so greedy. They use up all the toilet paper and they sit there watching
*  Ozark. But oh, the other one is Expanse. I heard the Expanse is really good. Have you ever seen that?
*  A bunch of people that I respect that like sci-fi told me that the Expanse,
*  which is I think that's an Amazon show. See that? Yeah, it's four seasons in.
*  The season coming soon. Amazon. Know anything about it? No, I haven't seen it at all. Brian?
*  No, I've never even heard of it. What? I heard it's really good. There's too many shows.
*  Oh, there definitely is. And they never stop. Yeah. They never stop. They never go,
*  we're just going to keep the shows we have and make them better. I nearly watched that Tiger
*  Show too because I was so annoyed of people asking me if I watch it. I'm like, I got to just watch
*  it so I could say yes and know what people are talking about. I'm so tired of hearing about it.
*  Yeah, dude, I was watching regular TV and it was you couldn't for some reason fast forward through
*  the commercials. What? Yeah, there was something going on where you couldn't fast forward through
*  commercials. I was going in and out of this room with the TV and I couldn't figure it out.
*  But while I was watching, I just stopped and paused watching these commercials on regular TV
*  for these upcoming shows that they have. And it's like, it's almost like they're trying to put you
*  into a coma, but they're trying to put you in a state of mind like some fake ass Norman Rockwell
*  painting of America. Some weird like they're trying. It's a calm down, easy to predict
*  version of a drama. You know, we're all in this together and it's perfect music and we're all
*  about God and family and they're all hugging and smiling and like, what are you doing to me here?
*  It doesn't work on me anymore. I can't watch that shit anymore. It's not you can't watch it.
*  But that's what I'm saying. It's so strange when you compare that to some of the shit that we watch
*  now. Like if you watch Game of Thrones or if you watch Ozark or if you watch, you know,
*  The Outsider, all these crazy fucking shows, you watch a show that's made like a 1980s CBS drama
*  and you're like, what is this? And then you realize, oh my God, they still make them.
*  They still make them. They make them just like that. Graze Anatomy has been on TV for
*  20 years. Is that still on? Is Dr. Dreamy still on that? Is he on it? You talking about Dr. Dreamy,
*  Patrick? Yeah, I met him once. He's a cool guy. He was a very nice guy. Yeah, I like what sports is
*  doing now because there's no sports or they've been doing NASCAR like video games and it looks
*  so real like a real NASCAR race and I guess Madden in like next week is going to have a football game
*  but it's going to be a video game Madden football game. So that might be the future of sports.
*  They are talking about doing like the NBA might do a whole their whole tournament in the Vegas
*  this summer because just like they do NBA summer league, they can't play any they all they're
*  fucked. They're fucked right now. They've not taken two weeks off. That's all the bronze said.
*  They might have to he might need like 10 games to get warmed back up to even start going.
*  They have no preseason again. All these guys. There's a China league that's starting up soon.
*  All those players from America that are going to go over there. They have to just work out on their
*  own just like some UFC fighters who can't fight right now. They're going to go and play in China.
*  Yeah son.
*  Stefan Marbury is a big star there and he's trying to get some mass sent back to Brooklyn
*  where he's from but he's a huge star in China now. Damn. Yeah. Interesting things happening.
*  The whole premier soccer league team all over Europe. They're going to like have like a World
*  Cup event type thing. A huge TV event. They're getting TV partners in place. They're going to
*  have like quarantine everyone put them in little camps all the tea like I don't know 30 teams maybe
*  25 teams who's buying up all the stock now that the market's crashed because you know that shit's
*  going on a lot of people that are still sports guy. Well I mean all sorts of people right.
*  Some people say that's a good thing to do. I don't know. It's still crashing. So I don't
*  well you got to wonder because the people that can buy the stock are the people that have the
*  most money already grocery stores. This could be a giant change and like who owns what. Yeah.
*  They speculated that like what company I think Apple could just buy Netflix or something crazy
*  like that. Disney was Disney. I think they said Disney could buy Netflix. No Apple could just buy
*  Disney. Oh yeah they definitely could. They definitely could. They have so much money.
*  They're so weird. Like the amount of money they have is weird. You know like what an amazing move.
*  What company has that kind of cash? No one. Amazon's close and they're going to be the first
*  two trillion dollar company. But it's a very different thing. They sell everything. Right.
*  They sell toothpaste and fucking bubble gum and nails. They'll sell you everything. But
*  Apple just sells you computers phones watches. Sit bitch. Sit. It's amazing. For right now.
*  It's amazing. But no one has loyalty to like tech products the way people have with Apple.
*  They didn't even have a store 10 years ago. Is it 10 years? I don't know but it's not been that long.
*  There's no Apple stores. You couldn't. You had to go to like a micro center. I think it's more than
*  10 years but you're right. But dude that fucking genius bar that was the ultimate like
*  calling it a genius bar. Like really? They're not. Come on man. These are just people that work here.
*  Why are you saying geniuses? These aren't geniuses. I want to be you're making these people
*  operate at such a exaggerated standard. Right. Like they have to be geniuses. Right. Can't just be a
*  guy who understands batteries. Oh yeah man. We'll test here. No it has to be a genius.
*  Excuse me sir. What's your IQ? Yeah gateway. We just call them tech support. Wasn't it the geek squad?
*  No that's our best buy. Best buy. That's hilarious. Geek somehow or another is more offensive than dork
*  to me. Oh yeah. Nerd is the top of the food chain. Nerd is like you could say it proud. But geek is
*  like you're a little fucked up. Right. And dork. It's not so bad. It's endearing kind of. Dork's
*  dork. Dork's cute. Yeah geek isn't cute. Geek is like you're freaking out. Keep it together bitch.
*  Yeah. Yeah dork is like you fucking dork. Like ah. Yeah. Geek is like a more. You can geek out.
*  And that's not bad. That's a good point. You can geek out in a good way. That's a good point.
*  Right. Yeah no one's complaining about language right now. Notice that? Yeah. All that shit went
*  away. But it's so much corona. It's just tiring watching. It's exhausting. Yeah. Well that's the
*  other thing that's going on with people is the fear man. When you have a hard time dealing.
*  You have anxiety. You have apprehension. You're just fearful of the future and fearful of the
*  disease. Some people had anxiety before this. This is going to accelerate everything. That's
*  going to be real hard for just for mental health of people. It's going to be people that are going
*  to have a really hard time also accepting that this is just something that happened
*  to them. This is not something that they did wrong. You know when something goes bad and you did
*  something wrong. It kind of like ah I made a bad decision. I should have done it that way. I fucked
*  up and we should have had that meeting. And then you know you might know why your business fell
*  apart. But if it falls apart now. It's like you didn't even do anything wrong. Yeah. And the
*  government gets to tell you they have to sit back. Now if you were a conspiracy theorist. And so
*  many of them are. You would think what would be the best way to gain more control of the people.
*  The best way first of all to accelerate despair and accelerate unemployment. You would do all
*  the things that are just going to happen from what naturally happens in a disease. People are
*  willing to give up certain civil liberties if they think they can get more safety. And it's true. We
*  should stay home. It's true. It will be better for everybody. It's true that we need to take
*  precautions. It's true that we need to self-isolate. All those things are true. But it's also true that
*  you're giving a certain amount of power to the government to lock things down and control you.
*  They're giving people tickets in New York. If they catch them walking around they give them $500
*  tickets. They're doing it in other places too I'm sure. And that's where it gets weird man. Because
*  who are these people? These people that are telling you can't go anywhere. They're just the
*  government. They're just people. They're people telling people that they can't go somewhere.
*  Which is fine if we need to do that like right now. But what if it just sort of stays that way?
*  What if it stays that way to a lesser extent? What if they say you know how we're going to stop
*  coronavirus from really taking place? I want to know where you're going. I want to know where
*  you're going. I want to know when you go through each state we're going to have checkpoints. We're
*  going to pull you over. It's going to be a heightened police state. Sir have you been tested for the
*  coronavirus and you put a fucking thing on your forehead? What if this thing really does start
*  coming back the way it has in Wuhan where people tested negative and then they later tested positive?
*  If that happens here are we going to keep this lockdown thing going on? What if it's something
*  that we all have and it comes back like when John Jones had those steroids in a system and the
*  picograms and it just kept flashing back? What if that's with this stuff? What if we test positive
*  for coronavirus every couple years? What if it's like herpes? What if you keep it for life? What
*  if we're assuming we got rid of it? We're going to just accept martial law? We're just going to
*  accept tanks in the streets? What are we going to accept? It's a real good question. So if you are
*  a nut right now you would be fucking going crazy because you'd be saying all the pieces are in place
*  for like a hostile takeover and they're in place because they really truly are the best ways to
*  save people's lives. Like it's all it's all a smart thing to do but if you were a conspiracy
*  theorist you'd say this is exactly what I would do if I wanted to take over and that's what we have
*  to be really careful of. We've got to be careful of somehow or another walking that very fine balance
*  of protecting people from a disease this invisible killer and preserving our freedom and preserving
*  rights. All those things are very important we don't just give that up because it's not the way
*  to go. It's just not. We have to figure out our way through this disease and then we have to figure
*  out some way to return to normalcy and that's got to happen. We can't just stay like this where no
*  one works anymore. We can't just not ever take risks. We can't just not go out. So once this does
*  get rolling again it's going to be real interesting to see how much if any control the government
*  retains. How much if any restrictions get imposed. How much of these restrictions we just absorb and
*  they become newer new things. A normal thing rather. Where you just go to the airport you have to take
*  a temperature test and go to the airport and they want to test you. Or we're going to have to start
*  wearing suits like kind of like Star Wars like these kind of suits with helmets and breathing
*  apparatus and everyone that works at the grocery store is going to be robots you know. Imagine that
*  you get to the hotel you decompress and unzip and you can enjoy New York City from your balcony.
*  Look so pretty out there with all the murderous viruses swarming around killing people. What if
*  the viruses got together made virus tornadoes and started just throwing people against walls.
*  Or virus babies if you're born. Listen man if a fucking if a wind can pick up a semi
*  and make it fly through the air like we've seen why can't a virus tornado just slam you into a
*  wall. Imagine if like viruses accelerate billions of times and they form colonies and they become
*  intelligent and they realize if they move quick enough they can actually like they could knock you
*  off your feet and they go down your throat like a demon.
*  That's not happening already. It's crazy for sure but so was a regular virus.
*  So was a regular virus. I mean just what we were reading about the H1N1 and all these other
*  flu's that kill so many countless thousands of people. Not countless they counted them.
*  They're actually pretty accurate right. We had to double check. I mean just think about the the
*  sheer numbers of people that have died from those things. If those were demons instead of diseases
*  how freaky would that be. If we're like look we're going to lose a certain amount of people
*  every year to demons. No matter what we do. Why is it better to lose to a virus than a demon.
*  Little Godzilla's.
*  Little Godzilla's just running up into your window and killing your grandma.
*  Baby Godzilla's.
*  Fuck! God damn it. You go in there and she's just bones just white bones sticking up.
*  There's a horde of little Godzilla's just chewing through her meat.
*  Why would that be more horrific than a virus. The silent thing that chokes you to death.
*  I need to know. I've been thinking that like hilarious. There's been that talk when we've
*  talked about UFO's that all the world needs to get to come together is like that alien invasion.
*  This is not too different than what that would be. It is an alien technically.
*  It is. It's foreign to us.
*  Action Bronson had it right the whole time. Just get high and watch ancient aliens try to
*  get so high you just try to sort through what they're saying. He figured it out.
*  It's interesting to think what if this did come from you know space like this.
*  Yeah they're sick of us. Imagine. Yeah just try to something just the real fear is that they're
*  eventually going to have something that you can't fix. You know I had this guy on
*  that was talking about with my friend. Do you remember that guy's name with Doug? Doug Duren?
*  The scientist Brian. His scientist friend who came in with my friend Doug Duren from Wisconsin to
*  talk about chronic wasting disease. Brian Richards. Brian Richards. Thank you. And he explained how
*  this is not made to jump to people but if it does it's going to be horrific. And it's like it's in
*  deer and it's made to jump to mice and it's spreading through the Midwest and like this is
*  something you got to keep an eye on. Like this is not a this is not a safe thing. Like if this does
*  make the jump to people and people get hit with this prion disease that's called chronic wasting
*  disease in deer. If that spreads to people we're fucked. We're fucked. It's going to be like a
*  zombie apocalypse. If that gets into people it's like they're 100 percent of them die. Deer they're
*  100 percent die. They don't live for very long either and it's a horrific death. Their body
*  shrivels. That's why they call it chronic wasting disease. They waste away and they're like vomiting
*  everywhere. All this like stuff is coming out of their mouth and their nose and this stuff that's
*  coming out of their mouth and nose is highly contagious. And then other deer come along and
*  eat the grass that they spit out this phlegm or this body fluid whatever the fuck it is and they
*  get it from that. And they get it from sharing food sources and they leave it everywhere too.
*  The deer are dying. This stuff comes out of them and they leave it everywhere. It's like the virus
*  knowing it's losing its host and it decides to just land on plants. Bro it's scary as fuck
*  because it's like mad cow disease. They just reported the other day read something in China
*  where they found a guy on a bus that got like a version of I don't know if it was corona that
*  usually has never traveled from rat or mouse to human. It was the first time ever.
*  Like so there might be already another corona that. What did you hear about this? This was like two
*  days ago. Oh no. They found a guy on the bus and they said don't worry this never happened before.
*  These patient zeros are really pissing me off. Yeah. What the fuck. Jamie is one handed. Let's
*  see who gets it. Hantavirus. Damn Jamie won. Six days ago. He can't fuck with them. Man who died
*  on bus in China test positive for hantavirus. Motherfucker. This is how many days ago? Six.
*  Make this a little larger so I can read it with my shitty eyes. A passenger who died on a bus in
*  China is tested positive for a completely different virus than COVID-19. One more fatal that often
*  produces very similar symptoms according to state run media. The unidentified woman from
*  Yunnan province died while on a chartered bus heading to his workplace
*  in Shandong province. The state run global times announced in a tweet on Monday.
*  He tested positive for hashtag hantavirus. Other 32 people on the bus were tested. The outlet stated
*  offering no further details. Oh fuck. The new virus starting just as China starts lifting its
*  strict quarantines from COVID-19. Jesus Christ. It's been around for a while. Okay. However,
*  experts were quickly to point out that it's not a new virus and is only rarely thought to have been
*  passed between humans. Oh, that doesn't make me feel good. Yeah. It's only recent that this is
*  starting to happen. Yeah, this is not good. Listen to this. The hantavirus first emerged in the 1950s
*  in American Korean war in Korea, Hantan river. It spreads from rat mice. If humans ingest their
*  body fluids, human human transmission is rare. Rare is not a word I like when it comes to a disease
*  that kills the fuck out of you. Please don't do not panic unless you plan to eat rats. And a billion
*  Chinese people just went fuck. Yeah. Well, at least dogs are okay. Well, how many of them eat rats?
*  They eat what they can eat, right? Those wet markets are just that. Whoa. After exposure to
*  fresh urine, droppings or saliva of infected rodents. Hey, symptoms may occur up to eight weeks
*  after exposure to fresh urine droppings or saliva infected rodents. Okay. Well, that can get a rat
*  to a person. So it can't get person to person yet. But what if that thing morphs? They're pretending
*  like things don't morph. You know, like bitch, they got to a person in the first place because
*  they made a jump. All these things, right? Avian flu, swine flu, all these flus, they jump from an
*  animal to a human. God, imagine if this starts going on. God damn it. Well, this is what I'm
*  saying. Now, what if it does? And then they keep this level of security and this level of restriction
*  and it restricts your freedom. Man, it makes you really realize how well we had it before those.
*  We can just do whatever you want it. You just right now you can just drive to Vegas. Let's go
*  to Vegas. Let's go see Britney Spears. Yay. You go down there, have a nice dinner. That's what we did.
*  Go see Britney. Britney, bitch. You know, not anymore, bitch. Now no one's going nowhere.
*  If you wanted to take over the world, isn't that the way you would do it?
*  I'm not saying that that's what's happening. But I'm saying if you were writing a book
*  on a takeover of the world by another nation, what better way to do it than that?
*  What if North Korea was behind all this? Well, I don't think they have the resources.
*  China, since it's in China, it's much more likely. Look, it started from China, whether it was
*  intentional or unintentional. That's beside the point. I don't think it was intentional. But I
*  think that when things like this happen, people do take advantage of opportunity. And you got to
*  be real careful who gets the better hand when they're taking advantage of opportunity. It's
*  new ground. It's weird for people. They know where it came from. They have isolated that this thing
*  did come from this market in Wuhan. They know. It's just, it's the way things like this can play
*  out if there's a bunch of these is almost just like someone starting a conspiracy. It's not,
*  it doesn't have to be done. Like it just actually naturally exists. And the same people that would
*  benefit from a conspiracy or who would engage the conspiracy to defraud people or fuck people over
*  in the first place, they're the ones who are going to jump in and take advantage of it the quickest.
*  That's what's so scary about it. Totalitarian ideas thrive when people are scared. They want
*  someone to take over the reins. They want someone to take over. We're going to block the streets.
*  No more travel. We're going to block this. You can't go to work. Can it block? Then you're going to
*  be poor and broke and scared. I'm not saying that that's what they're doing. What I am saying is if
*  you wanted to do something to really take over a civilization, it would be this way. That's how you
*  would do it. You would do it with diseases. I'm not saying they're doing that. I don't think they
*  are. I think this is just a horrible natural disaster. I want to be really clear on that.
*  But we might come out of this different than we went in. That's real. There's tanks driving down
*  the road in California. Tanks. And they're like, oh, they're just getting supplies or something.
*  Like we, there's tanks rolling through New York City. My friend, John Joseph, he sent me a video
*  from his phone of tanks rolling down New York City. Like armed humvees and tanks. Yeah. Freaky
*  like military vehicles and camo. Like, what are you hiding? You're in New York City. What are you
*  hiding from? What kind of camo is that? Is it weird that they, even when they use them in cities,
*  they camo them up? Yeah. It seems so rude. It is. So like to let you know, they might hide in the
*  bushes too, bitch. But they drive through the cities to lock everybody down. They had those
*  murdered out matte black paint jobs instead. It would be a little bit more intimidating.
*  Maybe a little pizza slices and stuff. Well, it's at least with camo. If you have your car
*  is all camoed up and you're not in the military, you know, they're going to have an eye on you
*  anyway. Like, what are you doing? Right. Unless you're in like West Virginia. Dudes who have like
*  camoed up H ones, Hummers, and they're driving those real military style Hummer around like,
*  please check that guy's house. You know, please, please read his Facebook. Please.
*  He's driving around with an armored vehicle, all camoed out.
*  You don't do you really need an H one Hummer in LA? They're so wide. Do they still? They don't
*  still make those. They don't still make them. But people still have them. Yeah. Not only do people
*  have them, but people, they do these mods on them because they're really slow. Like a Hummer is
*  really slow. And I'm pretty sure they're a diesel engine. It's like a slow, shitty, stinky engine.
*  It's not. It's not good. It's not optimal. So they take the engine out of those shit boxes and put
*  like giant American engines in there and turn them into a company in Florida. I forget what the
*  company is, but they make custom Humvees like the real military Humvees, but they deck them out
*  inside with dope interiors and they put ridiculous like thousand horsepower turbocharged engines in
*  them and shit. Look, if there is even like, if you have even one wacky idea in your head, like maybe
*  maybe someone could do, they already did it. Is it the coronavirus pandemic Hummer that they made?
*  Oh shit. They just uploaded it probably today. What's the company? Predator or something. Yes,
*  that's it. Yeah. Last week. So they made a coronavirus. That's what it says. I don't know.
*  Humvee. I was making a big assumption. See, that's the shit that they make. They make things like
*  those, but then they put these bonkers engines in them. Have you ever written in one of those?
*  You're real far from the person. We would be like this. That's how far we would be. Yeah. If I was
*  driving and you were the passenger, there would be almost this much space in between us. They're
*  real weird. But dude, you don't worry about shit when you're in one of those things. You're like,
*  run me over motherfucker. Good luck, bitch. They just feel like a real tank.
*  You could run over a wall in them, right? That's the thing I remember when I was a kid.
*  I don't know about that. Like a three foot wall or some shit.
*  Oh, over a wall? Yeah. The whole underside is completely protected. You can scratch over all
*  kinds of shit in it. Everything's inside. That's why there's that big hump. It's because the
*  drivetrain is all protected underneath the chassis. So you get this extraordinary travel
*  in terms of how far you can go over a rock. Your height, what is that called?
*  There's a term for that. How much travel space you have underneath the vehicle. Clearance.
*  Clearance. That's it. Yeah. So you have a shit ton of clearance. And there's a military designed,
*  over engineered vehicle for the streets. But if you're super paranoid.
*  I like how with my car you could do the clearance, that you could raise it.
*  Or lower it. That's pretty nice. Yeah. Those are the future, right?
*  Cybertruck. Yeah. All those electric cars are the future. They're just going to get better
*  at charging them. It's the future. Especially if we could really get solar down here in LA.
*  If we really nail solar. Yeah. I mean, the technology needs to change for sure,
*  because it would be nice to have solar on your car. But right now, I think I've read, like,
*  if you had all solar panels on top of your car, it still wouldn't do anything.
*  Isn't that crazy though? Like you have a source of power that people use to power their homes
*  and big buildings. Solar. But you can't utilize it in a car, which is always in the sun.
*  Especially out here. Right. Fisker figured it out. You know, Fisker did. They had a roof.
*  They had a solar roof that powered the radio. Yeah. It only powered the radio though.
*  But that's better than nothing. You think it would still be like, hey, if my car is sitting
*  out all day, at least it gave me 20 miles. Something like that. Right. Right. If it's
*  sitting in the parking lot all day, it should be sucking up some juice. Yeah.
*  I think that's coming too. I think just the technology is just not 100% there.
*  Well, they need a battery technology jump, right? They need a big jump in how much power gets stored
*  and how quickly you can get it in there. Because right now it's still a little clunky. Yeah. Well,
*  the Tesla wall, the battery pack of the wall, that's pretty badass for you. It's pretty badass,
*  but what I mean is it takes too long to charge a car. Right. And then it doesn't have long enough
*  of a range. Right. Well, that's when the wireless charging on the roads where you're just driving
*  on a wireless charger. You just got to give up a microchip. They just put a microchip in your hand
*  and you're fine. And it's also, it doubles as a Corona tester. So you make sure that you never
*  get mistaken for someone with Corona. They just have to scan you. Hey, you going to this bathroom?
*  Can I have your hand please? Whomp. Up green. Go ahead and urinate with peace and harmony.
*  Go ahead. We're putting those UV lights everywhere. Am I freaking out? I mean,
*  really, I'm trying not to sound like a conspiracy nut because I'm not accusing anyone of creating
*  a conspiracy. But what I am saying is if, if I was a conspiracy nut or if I was a country
*  that was conspiring to take over the world, this is not a bad way to do it.
*  I don't think that's happening right now. I want to be real clear, but it's kind of the same result
*  that we're experiencing right now where everyone's being forced to shut down with
*  who knows what consequences, but it's also the right thing to do. So we're all like, whoa,
*  how do you, you know, it's another one of those things about being a person where the right thing
*  to do still feels crazy. It still feels like, all right, we're just going to sit around. Yeah,
*  I guess that's what you have to do. You know, it's kind of in one way encouraging that so many people
*  are willing to stay home and people aren't rebelling. They're like, fuck you. This is my
*  country. I'm going to go to work. I'll take a chance. It's everybody's going to get it anyway.
*  Fuck you. There's way less people doing that. And when you consider that the government is controlling
*  320 million people, pretty crazy. Almost everyone's complying with staying home. There's only a few
*  essential businesses. Yeah, we're going to have to, I think, really have spacesuits to leave the
*  house and work. God damn it. They're going to probably be like this, this metal plastic thing
*  that could wash off really soon. Yeah, they're only going to be padded. Dudes are going to put socks in their spacesuits.
*  It's going to be a mess. Are you worried, Jamie? Yeah. I've never seen you this worried. Because I've,
*  everything you're sort of saying, like I look into the future and try to see where we're headed.
*  And I don't see a, I don't really see much out there because I don't know where it is, but it's
*  not anything good because there's nothing there. I don't see like going to the movies again. Seems
*  like that's probably close to out movies were already dying anyway. They might not survive this.
*  They've already opened up the ability to like put those right into your house for 20 bucks. Perfect.
*  Way better. Sweet. So winter movie theaters can open again. All right. What's next? Yeah. Concerts,
*  sporting events. Yeah. I don't know. That's just, those are all the fun things we used to do. So like
*  fuck it's also once everything's in place where they can treat people effectively and they have
*  the adequate number of ventilators, then are we going to go back to the way things were?
*  Or are we going to have new standards in place? I don't know. I don't know, man. They look, they
*  did an unprecedented thing. They locked down the entire country to save people's lives. Never
*  happened before. We're in new territory and you know it's dangerous when a moron like me is making
*  sense. And I'm, when I'm one of the people who's talking about something like this. I try to find
*  it. I just read yesterday, I don't know if someone shared this was a F Scott Fitzgerald wrote,
*  I think this was a letter found from 1920 when he was living in France during the Spanish flu.
*  And like he was talking, I don't know who he was writing to. I'll try to find it right now, but
*  he's talking about how they stocked up on a bunch of alcohol and people were being told,
*  almost like now, like you're not, you're told not to go anywhere, but some people don't believe it.
*  I forget he was talking about another writer friend of his who wasn't taking it seriously.
*  And like, well, so it was like real sound. It sounded very similar to this. Yeah.
*  I guess that's how people always have been right. Especially back then when
*  it's real hard to get information. Imagine people are dying and everyone's just like,
*  what's going on? You got to read the newspaper like fuck. What happened? It's fake.
*  How they get you. I just saw that this note was going viral during the pandemic and a lot of
*  people have been falling for it. Son of a bitch. Well, what a good way to end.
*  Everything's fine. Everything's fake. I'm glad you guys are still doing kill Tony. I really do. I
*  think it's an awesome move. It's a way to go. Just keep, keep pumping out the content, let people
*  know you're there and you know, they'll be psyched when, when everything gets back up and
*  running again, you guys back up, run it to your live shows. I'm hope we're all on the road again
*  in, at the very least this summer. I really hope so. It's been fun though. Having this podcast.
*  Definitely good times. Fun times. Give everybody your Instagram, Red Band, R E D B A N. Twitter,
*  same. Yeah. Red band and check me out. Just check my VR out. I'm doing it almost every night. I'm
*  doing a VR. Can they join in there and fuck with you? They're in the chat room. I have the
*  chat room open right now. But no, no, no. I mean like in the game. They can't, when I'm playing
*  VR chat, which is my second thing I've been playing a lot, VR chats, like an old chat room
*  back in the day. So you can see it when you're in VR. You know, ready player one, where everyone's
*  a different avatar. That's how it is. It's like you come up and SpongeBob's talking to you.
*  Oh, so you actually talk to the people and you see them. Oh, you see them. You have sex with them
*  in the game. It's great. So check it out. Red Band on YouTube. Oh, they're going to all fuck you now.
*  All right. Bye everybody.
