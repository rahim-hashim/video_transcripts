# Joe Rogan Experience #2319 - Rick Doblin
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5.8s)]
*  Quick, Tom, what a turn of events. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=9.56s)]
*  This is absolutely incredible, Joe. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=14.4s)]
*  Absolutely a series of unexpected things have led to this day. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  You were supposed to do Duncan's podcast and then Duncan and I got on the phone and he [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=20.76s)]
*  was saying, you know, trying to move tickets for the psychedelic event. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=25.0s)]
*  And then Duncan said, you know, hey man, you can have them on your show. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=28.68s)]
*  And I said, well, why don't you come on too? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=33.24s)]
*  It'd be really fun. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=34.64s)]
*  And then this morning Duncan has a root canal, like an unexpected emergency root canal. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=35.64s)]
*  So it was just a crazy turn of events. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=41.4s)]
*  And fortunately, you're here. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I just came in from Ukraine. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=46.44s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  Oh, what are we doing over there? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  Training therapists and psychiatrists. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=52.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=54.68s)]
*  Ukraine has enormous amounts of trauma. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=55.68s)]
*  And so what I'm trying to do is to go to high trauma areas and try to talk about MDMA assisted [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=59.72s)]
*  therapy and how that could be helpful. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=66.8s)]
*  What is the legality of it over there? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, right now it's illegal. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=71.16s)]
*  They have these terrible laws left over from when Russia was in control and you cannot [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=72.48s)]
*  even do research with schedule one drugs. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  Not with psilocybin, not with MDMA. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=81.8s)]
*  You can't even do research. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=83.28s)]
*  But over the last couple of years, there's been a lot of efforts by their military, by [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=85.0s)]
*  other people to change that because they're aware that they have so much enormous trauma. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=88.4s)]
*  So a couple of months ago, the Ukrainian government put out draft legislation to change the law. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=93.76s)]
*  And so the training that we did was for 55 psychiatrists and therapists from throughout [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=100.4s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  We did it in the western part of Ukraine, Lviv, which is not really a dangerous area. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=107.72s)]
*  Even while we were there, there were multiple air raid sirens. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=114.64s)]
*  But then they look at their phone and they see the area that the air raid sirens are [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=118.36s)]
*  supposedly about and they could be like 100 miles square, something like that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=121.53999999999999s)]
*  So nobody seemed to care. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=126.16s)]
*  Nobody moved to shelters. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=128.64s)]
*  And we just ignored these air raid sirens and heard nothing. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=130.24s)]
*  But it's just it was so emotionally moving because we went to the cemetery in Lviv and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=134.5s)]
*  they have these in cities all over Ukraine. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=140.2s)]
*  And they have something that I've never seen before is that they have just enormous numbers [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=143.68s)]
*  of graves. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=147.36s)]
*  Terrible. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=148.36s)]
*  They've lost about 250,000 people. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=149.36s)]
*  But the graves all have flags for Ukraine, but they have the pictures of the person that's [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=152.96s)]
*  dead. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=157.52s)]
*  That's the person that's buried there. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=158.52s)]
*  And I've never seen that anywhere else. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=160.36s)]
*  It has even more of an emotional impact because you're actually not just thinking all these [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  people are dead, but you're seeing their pictures. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=169.22s)]
*  Most of them are younger and tragically interrupted their lives. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=171.72s)]
*  A fair number of women. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=176.84s)]
*  And so and they put them in the center of the cities. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=179.84s)]
*  They're having to build new grave sites all over. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=183.72s)]
*  And this was next to a really large old historic cemetery. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=185.88s)]
*  And so it feels to me like what I'm trying to do is to really go to where people I think [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=192.28s)]
*  have lots of trauma but don't understand some of these new technologies, meaning psychedelic [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=201.28s)]
*  therapies. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=206.51999999999998s)]
*  Hardly new. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  Well new to them. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  So they've been very much a conservative society. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=210.92s)]
*  They don't have legal marijuana. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=214.28s)]
*  They don't have marijuana. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=216.26s)]
*  How dare you. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=217.6s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=220.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=221.6s)]
*  So it was very moving to be there for their just the fact that we were there, that people [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=222.6s)]
*  felt that we were willing to come to the country and be there with them, even though it's in [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  this more safe part of the country. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=236.64s)]
*  And so the thought that we would the next steps would all be philanthropy. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=239.84s)]
*  So I should say that I'm here representing myself. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  I'm not talking on behalf of MAPS and I'm not talking on behalf of Lycos, the pharmaceutical [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=249.88000000000002s)]
*  company that MAPS helped start a while ago. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=255.0s)]
*  So I'm just talking for myself personally. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=258.72s)]
*  But what we're trying to do is really respond to where the trauma is. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=261.32s)]
*  And next week I'm going to Beirut, which is something I never thought I would be going [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=267.04s)]
*  to. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=273.16s)]
*  But I've been invited to speak at the American University of Beirut and also a YPO sort of [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=274.16s)]
*  business group. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=278.96s)]
*  And there's the possibility of potentially at least starting research with MDMA therapy [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=280.79999999999995s)]
*  in Lebanon as well. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=287.47999999999996s)]
*  Do you ever get frustrated at the lack of progress with legalization? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=289.4s)]
*  Because it seems like so much headway has been made on the therapeutic front. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=294.96s)]
*  Like so many people have anecdotal stories of like a lot of soldiers with Ibogaine in [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=299.67999999999995s)]
*  particular, MDMA in particular, that these people have had incredible experiences, turned [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=306.8s)]
*  their life around. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=311.68s)]
*  It just, I'm so baffled by the snail's pace of acceptance of these things. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=312.68s)]
*  Well I first tried MDMA in 1982. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=321.32s)]
*  So we're talking about 43 years ago. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=324.24s)]
*  And as soon as I experienced it, I thought this has incredible therapeutic potential. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=327.0s)]
*  It was legal at the time. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  When did it become illegal? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=336.0s)]
*  1985. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=338.0s)]
*  And so it had been, MDMA had been a, it had been legal but it was sort of quietly used [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=339.32s)]
*  in therapy circles from the, around 1976 to the early 80s. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=345.96s)]
*  And then it started leaking out of these therapy circles and started being used as a party [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=352.56s)]
*  drug ecstasy. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  Wasn't a lot of that in Dallas? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=358.59999999999997s)]
*  Yes, a lot of it was at the Star Club in Dallas. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=359.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, that is really where MDMA became ecstasy. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=363.56s)]
*  Lorenzo from the psychedelic salon. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=366.64s)]
*  I learned all about that from him. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=369.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=371.52000000000004s)]
*  There's a fellow named Michael Caine is working on a movie about the Star Club. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=372.52000000000004s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=376.88s)]
*  There's an incredible story because Larry Hagman, who is the star of Dallas, frequented [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=377.88s)]
*  this nightclub with a bunch of the people from the cast. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=384.24s)]
*  And they had, the police had decided to bust it because they knew that there was all these [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=387.68s)]
*  experiences. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=393.32s)]
*  Did they bust JR Ewing? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=394.32s)]
*  No, no. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=395.32s)]
*  They had to, they were all prepared to bust the Star Club that night and unexpectedly [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=396.32s)]
*  JR Ewing, Larry Hagman showed up and they canceled the bus because they thought it would [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=402.64s)]
*  be too embarrassing to bust him and they busted it another time. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=407.28s)]
*  He was on CNN once and he was talking about how he's not afraid of death because he had [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=411.32s)]
*  an incredible LSD experience. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=415.84s)]
*  Did you ever see that? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=417.4s)]
*  I did, yeah. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=418.96s)]
*  And the reason- [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=419.96s)]
*  They were like, what? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=420.96s)]
*  Well, he did LSD therapy in the 60s. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=422.08s)]
*  The reason that I even knew that is my mother-in-law read his autobiography and he talks about [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=424.71999999999997s)]
*  being doing LSD therapy in the 60s. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=431.35999999999996s)]
*  And so my mother-in-law said, you might want to try to contact this guy because maybe he's [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=434.08s)]
*  got overlapping interests and he'll he'll howl out. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=439.59999999999997s)]
*  And it took me a couple of years to get to him, but eventually I did. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=442.59999999999997s)]
*  One funny story is that I got to know him pretty well and I would stay over at his house [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=447.52s)]
*  a bunch of times in Santa Monica. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=451.12s)]
*  And but he was also in I Dream of Jeannie. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=453.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=457.44s)]
*  So I Dream of Jeannie is about this Jeannie that comes out of this bottle. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=458.44s)]
*  He's an astronaut. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=463.64000000000004s)]
*  And a friend of his had made a bong out of the Jeannie bottle. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=465.88s)]
*  And they wanted to market it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=472.68s)]
*  And Larry said, no way. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  So there was only two versions of this Jeannie bong. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=476.92s)]
*  And I had to one of my more humorous moments was Smoking Pot with Larry Hagman. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=482.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=490.92s)]
*  It's so funny when a guy plays this like straight laced, greedy kind of psycho on a television [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=491.92s)]
*  show, a soap opera show. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=497.56s)]
*  And then in real life, he's a stoner. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=499.08000000000004s)]
*  Oh, he's incredible. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=500.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=501.92s)]
*  That interesting though. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=502.92s)]
*  That's like because you would never guess that from the JRU in character. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=503.92s)]
*  Oh, right. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=507.72s)]
*  No, he was very much pro psychedelic and had multiple experiences during the 60s. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=508.72s)]
*  And the CNN interview was wild, though, because they were there. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=513.6800000000001s)]
*  I remember watching it go, oh, you guys weren't ready for this. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=516.6s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=520.84s)]
*  That they're like, what? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=521.84s)]
*  You're saying acid's good? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=522.84s)]
*  It's like literally the opposite of the Bill Hicks joke. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=524.52s)]
*  You know, the Bill Hicks joke, like you never hear like a good drug story. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=527.28s)]
*  It's always young man on acid thinks he can fly, dies. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=532.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=535.9200000000001s)]
*  It's like that was the one time that a positive drug story from a like a beloved star of a [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=536.9200000000001s)]
*  beloved show. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=544.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it was the most popular TV show in the world at some point. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=545.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=549.6400000000001s)]
*  But about your question about frustration. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=550.6400000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=552.88s)]
*  The answer is yes. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=554.08s)]
*  But it's important not to be overwhelmed, I guess, by frustration is just to continue [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=555.38s)]
*  plotting along. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=562.24s)]
*  We've just passed MAPS's 39th anniversary, April 8th. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=563.48s)]
*  I had 1986 is when I started MAPS. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=569.64s)]
*  And when I started MAPS, I didn't really know that it would ever succeed, that we would [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=573.64s)]
*  ever make MDMA into medicine. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=577.56s)]
*  It was the height of Nancy Reagan and just saying no and the escalation of the drug war. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=579.72s)]
*  The worst times. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=584.36s)]
*  And I realized that it was worth doing, working towards bringing psychedelics forward, whether [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=585.52s)]
*  it worked or not. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=591.24s)]
*  And that's what really gave me the mindset to not be overwhelmed by the frustration by [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=592.88s)]
*  how many obstacles there's been. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=598.34s)]
*  Because I always had this feeling that we need this kind of healing. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=601.48s)]
*  We need this access to these experiences. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=606.04s)]
*  And it's been tragic when we think about the number of veteran suicides, for example, that [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=610.16s)]
*  are happening every year. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=615.76s)]
*  The Drug Enforcement Administration, when they made MDMA illegal in 1985, they did that [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=618.0400000000001s)]
*  on an emergency basis. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=623.9200000000001s)]
*  We were in the middle of a lawsuit against the DEA, what's called an administrative [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=625.64s)]
*  law judge lawsuit. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=630.64s)]
*  And we were challenging this arguments for making it into a schedule one drug. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=633.08s)]
*  And we actually won the case. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=639.0600000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=640.5200000000001s)]
*  The judge said it should be schedule three, which means it should be available as a medicine, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=641.5200000000001s)]
*  but it should be illegal otherwise for recreational use. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=646.64s)]
*  But administrative law judges only give advice to the agencies that they're working in. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=650.9s)]
*  They don't compel. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=656.52s)]
*  You have to get out of that into the civil courts. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=657.92s)]
*  So the judge said schedule three. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=660.92s)]
*  And the Drug Enforcement Administration said, no way, we're not going to do that. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=663.92s)]
*  And their rationale was so wrong. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=668.48s)]
*  So we sued them in the appeals court. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=671.0s)]
*  What they said initially was that only the FDA could make a drug into a medicine, not [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=673.32s)]
*  the DEA. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=677.5200000000001s)]
*  But the law was clear that it could be the attorney general could do that. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=678.5200000000001s)]
*  So the appeals court, when they review agencies' decisions, they don't tell them what to do. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=682.2800000000001s)]
*  They say, you did something wrong, now rethink it. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=688.5600000000001s)]
*  So then the DEA said, OK, we're going to rethink it. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=691.5200000000001s)]
*  And then they came up with a new reason why they were against it. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=694.84s)]
*  And this was this eight-part standard that was essentially the same as the FDA. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=697.5600000000001s)]
*  So then we sued them again. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=702.0400000000001s)]
*  The second time. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=703.24s)]
*  And we won again in the appeals courts. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=705.0s)]
*  And so they went back to the DEA and said, you have to come up with another rationale. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=707.08s)]
*  This one doesn't work either. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=711.2s)]
*  And then they came up with a five-part standard that was sufficiently different but still [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=713.28s)]
*  had phase three studies. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=717.76s)]
*  So it's essentially the same as FDA approval. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=719.04s)]
*  And finally, the courts upheld that. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=722.84s)]
*  And that's during this process. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=724.74s)]
*  It was clear to me that the DEA would not do anything to make this available as a medicine, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=726.7s)]
*  that we would have to go through the FDA. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=732.28s)]
*  And that's where MAPS began as a nonprofit psychedelic pharmaceutical company focused [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=734.3s)]
*  entirely on donations. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=740.22s)]
*  And the intention was to turn it into a generic drug. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=742.46s)]
*  Because MDMA had been invented by Merck in 1912. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=745.86s)]
*  It was in the public domain. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=749.14s)]
*  It was used as a therapy drug before I even knew about it. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=750.14s)]
*  And then it turned out that the emergency scheduling that DEA did in 1985 was itself [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=753.78s)]
*  illegal. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=758.9399999999999s)]
*  It turned out that the Congress had given the attorney general the power to emergency [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=761.62s)]
*  schedule drugs. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=767.82s)]
*  But the attorney general had never subdelegated that power down to the DEA. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=769.16s)]
*  So they didn't have the authority to do that. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=774.08s)]
*  So the people that got busted in the first year were all let go once their lawyers figured [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=776.0s)]
*  this out. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=780.9s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=781.9s)]
*  So the first move to criminalize MDMA was a crime, you could say. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=782.9s)]
*  Wow. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=786.74s)]
*  But we're stuck. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=787.74s)]
*  And so when we think about if MDMA had not been criminalized, how many people's lives [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=788.86s)]
*  would have been saved? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=793.12s)]
*  How many people would have been able to benefit from psychedelics? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=794.12s)]
*  That's one of the things that we're going to be talking about at the Psychedelic Science [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=799.26s)]
*  2025 Conference, the 16th to the 20th in June in Denver. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=802.1s)]
*  We have over 500 speakers. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=807.52s)]
*  We had over 1,500 applications. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=810.82s)]
*  There's an enormous amount of research taking place with psychedelics, with psilocybin, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=812.9s)]
*  with Ibogaine, with MDMA, with 5-MeO DMT, with a whole host. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=817.5s)]
*  And the healing potential of these are incredible. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=821.94s)]
*  And yet they've been kept away from people by these prohibitionist laws. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=824.9s)]
*  And so it's enormously frustrating and tragic. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=831.54s)]
*  And yet if we let that overwhelm us, then we're not going to work as hard to make it [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=835.36s)]
*  happen. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=839.94s)]
*  So I've had to learn how to deal with that frustration. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=840.94s)]
*  It's just a gross distortion of the legal system. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=842.78s)]
*  There's no reason why this should be illegal. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=846.22s)]
*  As long as you have whiskey and you can get Adderall easily on a prescription, and oxycodone [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=849.38s)]
*  is readily prescribed, this is crazy. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=857.74s)]
*  Well it's counterproductive. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=860.42s)]
*  It's not even stopping a lot of the benefits. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=862.1s)]
*  It's actually creating more harms. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=866.34s)]
*  Just as one example, my father was a pediatrician. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=869.66s)]
*  He's no longer alive. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=872.86s)]
*  But he worked on the first study with crack babies. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=874.22s)]
*  He and his partners did the pediatric evaluation. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=876.6600000000001s)]
*  And you remember this in the 80s. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=880.26s)]
*  This idea was that there's going to be this whole generation of super predators and these [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=881.46s)]
*  women that were pregnant with crack were having babies that were addicted and they were going [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=885.7s)]
*  to be mentally deficient and prone to violence in this whole scenario that Reagan amplified. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=889.14s)]
*  And what my father and his partners found out was that really these kids could recover, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=898.28s)]
*  that they could do better, that it was mostly malnutrition, poverty. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=904.1s)]
*  It's not like fetal alcohol syndrome. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=909.26s)]
*  That it was really not this direct connection between the crack cocaine and the problems [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=911.66s)]
*  with these kids. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=916.66s)]
*  But what he found was that the women that were pregnant and were addicted were driven [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=918.38s)]
*  away from- [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=923.4200000000001s)]
*  The fucking phone is dinging again, man. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=924.4200000000001s)]
*  Just put it on do not disturb. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=926.14s)]
*  Yeah, let me just turn it off. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=927.5s)]
*  All you boomers and your goddamn gadgets. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=932.5s)]
*  But he found that these women were dissuaded from seeking treatment. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=938.3s)]
*  Why? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=942.42s)]
*  Because they were worried that they would have their babies taken away from them because [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=943.42s)]
*  they were worried they were going to go to jail. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=946.46s)]
*  So the drug war is counterproductive in that the people that need the help the most are [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=948.1s)]
*  driven away from seeking it because of the stigma and shame and criminality. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=954.42s)]
*  Then they screw up sometimes and do like what Portland did where they just go, everybody [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=959.0200000000001s)]
*  just do whatever you want. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=962.62s)]
*  And then unfortunately you've already set a culture where you've allowed people to do [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=963.98s)]
*  fentanyl in the street and meth and whatever else they want. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=967.1800000000001s)]
*  And then the laws pass where you decriminalize everything. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=971.0200000000001s)]
*  It's legal free for all. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=976.94s)]
*  And then unfortunately you have chaos. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=978.22s)]
*  And then they pulled back the law because it was just too much. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=980.46s)]
*  People were going there just so they could get high. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=982.86s)]
*  Well, that's the important point what you just said. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=985.4200000000001s)]
*  People were going there. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=987.3800000000001s)]
*  So what that means is that and we saw this in Zurich. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=988.38s)]
*  So there was a place in Zurich multiple decades ago called Needle Park where they decided [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=991.1s)]
*  to provide access to health care, access to safe injection sites, things like this for [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=996.9399999999999s)]
*  heroin addicts and others in Zurich. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1002.9s)]
*  And it was working because when you treat people as humans like that they will often [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1006.02s)]
*  seek other treatment. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1011.02s)]
*  And then if they're not necessarily criminals. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1013.06s)]
*  But then people come from all over and overwhelm the capacity because it's this one humane [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1015.46s)]
*  site and then it became an open air drug market. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1021.7800000000001s)]
*  Just people from all over Europe started coming and then they had the backlash. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1024.54s)]
*  So I think it's something somewhat similar in Portland where you try some of these things [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1028.06s)]
*  on a local basis but then it attracts people from all over and then it turns into the opposite [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1031.54s)]
*  of what they'd hoped. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1037.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1038.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1039.52s)]
*  And it's just I just think also they had gone through the whole defund the police thing. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1040.52s)]
*  They were just overwhelmed by cases. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1045.1399999999999s)]
*  The Portland just had a fucking out of control. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1048.1399999999999s)]
*  It was a lovely place a few years ago. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1050.98s)]
*  Just a lovely place. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1054.02s)]
*  Ten years ago Portland was amazing. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1055.3s)]
*  It's all a bunch of sweethearts and hippies. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1056.86s)]
*  They were like so calm and something happened and people got radicalized and then the tents, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1059.1399999999999s)]
*  the people, the camping on the street. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1064.74s)]
*  Once that happened and you tolerated people just putting tents up in the middle of the [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1066.86s)]
*  city it's like don't ignore these people. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1070.3s)]
*  Either help them out or tell them they have to move or do something. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1073.94s)]
*  You can't just clog up your city with mentally ill drug addicts who are in tents. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1076.94s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1082.1s)]
*  It is and it's hard to have these local solutions because it attracts those people. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1083.1s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1088.18s)]
*  People probably got on trains to go to Portland and get high. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1089.18s)]
*  They did. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1091.94s)]
*  So these kind of solutions I think people take the wrong idea from them that the solution [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1092.94s)]
*  itself was the wrong idea but I think it's when you do it on a local basis like that [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1097.18s)]
*  and not have it widely distributed. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1102.14s)]
*  So basically the idea is that you have people that have problems with substance abuse of [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1104.3s)]
*  all kinds. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1110.18s)]
*  We don't criminalize people who are alcoholics. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1111.38s)]
*  They can go to AA. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1114.22s)]
*  They can go to other things. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1115.22s)]
*  They're not stigmatized and they're not worried that they're going to be arrested and yet [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1116.22s)]
*  they can go for help and you have a lot of people that actually do that. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1121.42s)]
*  And I think that's kind of humane approach. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1126.7s)]
*  That's where we should be leaning as a society. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1128.98s)]
*  That's a healthy intelligence society and also we should be paying attention to the [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1131.5800000000002s)]
*  people that report great benefits. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1135.26s)]
*  Luckily we have guys like Rick Perry and Rick Perry who was the Republican governor of Texas [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1137.22s)]
*  is now really in full support of this Ibogaine initiative. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1146.06s)]
*  It's wonderful. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1150.26s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1151.26s)]
*  Well Rick Perry will be speaking at the conference. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1152.26s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1153.26s)]
*  Love that guy. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1154.26s)]
*  Brian Hubbard. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1155.26s)]
*  The work that you did to have Rick Perry and Brian Hubbard on your show and how much that [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1156.82s)]
*  brought attention to the Ibogaine possibilities was incredible. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1161.3799999999999s)]
*  Well it's my feeling is if a guy like Rick Perry who's this like straight nose conservative [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1164.94s)]
*  right wing kind of a guy if he can open up his eyes to that and open up his heart to [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1172.66s)]
*  that it's available for everybody. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1177.78s)]
*  And there's this very binary position that people take in regards to their thoughts on [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1180.74s)]
*  psychedelics. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1188.34s)]
*  It's either it's for losers and people that want to escape reality or you know if you're [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1189.34s)]
*  on the side of the people that have experienced it you don't get any of that which is what [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1197.58s)]
*  is so weird for me. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1203.18s)]
*  So the people that think that it's for losers and it's all just a bunch of people just trying [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1204.3s)]
*  to escape reality and they're lazy and none of those people saying that have ever done [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1209.02s)]
*  it. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1213.06s)]
*  So if you can get just a few of them to do it and tell their friends you know if we had [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1214.06s)]
*  like legitimate therapy centers because everybody needs a little help. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1219.58s)]
*  I'm not saying you need to get off heroin you know like I'm not saying you're coming [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1224.06s)]
*  back from Afghanistan. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1227.58s)]
*  I'm not saying anything crazy but like everybody could use just a little therapeutic help to [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1228.58s)]
*  give you a fresh perspective and I think if that was available to a lot of people that [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1235.1799999999998s)]
*  are just generally depressed I think we could change the tone of the country. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1239.9399999999998s)]
*  I really do. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1245.26s)]
*  Because one of the things that bums me out the most about especially the interactions [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1246.26s)]
*  that people have on social media is like it's all negative. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1251.1799999999998s)]
*  It's all negative. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1255.1s)]
*  You're living in these rare moments you have a finite amount of time. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1257.1799999999998s)]
*  A hundred years is so quick. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1262.3799999999999s)]
*  It goes by so fast and you're wasting it yelling at people on Twitter for what for what. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1265.22s)]
*  Like commenting on things all day long in anger and disgust and look where this country [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1272.78s)]
*  is like what are you talking about. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1278.7s)]
*  Everyone's perspective needs a little help needs a little pick me up just a little something [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1281.5400000000002s)]
*  to go you know I think we're OK. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1286.7s)]
*  I think we're going to be OK. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1289.18s)]
*  I think that there are so many possible benefits from having psychedelic clinics all over all [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1291.4199999999998s)]
*  over. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1297.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah I mean we're talking about right now there's several thousand ketamine clinics but one [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1298.1399999999999s)]
*  of the issues with ketamine clinics is that many of them provide ketamine without therapy. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1303.34s)]
*  So I've. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1310.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah I've met a lot of those people. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1311.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah yes. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1315.6599999999999s)]
*  So I think the key point is that when we talk about psychedelics when we talk about the [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1316.6599999999999s)]
*  clinics it's not here take this pill right. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1320.5s)]
*  It's here take this pill in a therapeutic context with therapists there to help process [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1323.78s)]
*  the emotions with an expert someone who's experienced it themselves who can help you. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1328.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah and then with the therapy afterwards as we call the integration process. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1333.02s)]
*  So it's not just the experience itself it's the preparation to be open to whatever happens. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1338.26s)]
*  It's the experience and then I just was the other day with a woman Gould Dolan who is [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1343.78s)]
*  a neuroscientist and what she's talked about and what she's discovered is that psychedelics [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1349.3s)]
*  are these rare substances that have the open up what they call the critical periods. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1354.3799999999999s)]
*  So it's neuroplasticity it's this ability to rewire your brain that stays for sometimes [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1360.82s)]
*  weeks or longer with ibogaine it can be several months after you have the experience so that [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1366.4199999999998s)]
*  the therapy that happens afterwards the work that you do to integrate it has special potential [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1371.6599999999999s)]
*  to make long term changes in your behavior in your brain circuitry and so psychedelics [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1376.86s)]
*  are unique among substances. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1382.58s)]
*  People are trying to develop non psychedelic psychedelics that do have this neuroplasticity [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1386.3s)]
*  property. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1389.78s)]
*  But they open up this potential for long term change if you do the therapy afterwards if [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1391.1799999999998s)]
*  you focus on trying to what the insights that you had during the experience and then try [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1397.1399999999999s)]
*  to make them into permanent behavior patterns. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1402.34s)]
*  That's really fascinating. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1405.1799999999998s)]
*  It's also so typically human that we try to develop non psychedelic versions of the same [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1407.22s)]
*  thing like we can we can do better than nature. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1410.46s)]
*  God was on to something but you know he had an early plan it wasn't really fleshed out [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1415.1399999999999s)]
*  yet. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1418.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1419.7s)]
*  Well one of the things that was really impactful for Rick Perry was Morgan Littrell who is now [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1420.7s)]
*  a member of Congress. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1428.22s)]
*  And so Morgan had very terrible trauma from his military service and eventually was able [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1430.3400000000001s)]
*  to experience Ibogaine. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1438.26s)]
*  And from that he was able to get a lot better. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1441.1000000000001s)]
*  And there's a researcher Nolan Williams will also be at the conference who's done work [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1445.3s)]
*  with Ibogaine and a lot of the Navy SEALs and others that have gone down to Mexico and [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1449.8600000000001s)]
*  he's done studies of their brains with traumatic brain injury. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1454.7s)]
*  And it's shown before and after that some of them actually do have this recovery from [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1459.74s)]
*  traumatic brain injury. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1464.5s)]
*  It's pretty phenomenal. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1466.02s)]
*  It's also helps people with other neurological disorders. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1468.1000000000001s)]
*  It's helped people with Parkinson's. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1471.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1472.98s)]
*  And that is where it could make sense in certain ways to have non psychedelic psychedelics. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1473.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1478.66s)]
*  But also why not if Ibogaine is working. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1479.66s)]
*  Well yeah. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1481.46s)]
*  Get him on that. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1482.46s)]
*  You already have Parkinson's. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1483.46s)]
*  Are you scared? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1484.46s)]
*  Well and then you get the insights though as well. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1485.46s)]
*  But there's people that might not want that. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1489.98s)]
*  It's difficult. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1492.46s)]
*  But why do they not want it? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1493.46s)]
*  They don't want it because of propaganda. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1494.98s)]
*  They don't want it because someone you know there's the stories of like Sid Barrett from [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1497.38s)]
*  Pink Floyd or you know what I mean. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1503.02s)]
*  The stories of people losing their mind. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1504.94s)]
*  That's what people are terrified of. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1506.98s)]
*  I think with some people honestly that's a valid point now that you're saying that. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1508.6200000000001s)]
*  There's a bunch of people that are like very psychologically vulnerable and maybe a profound [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1512.8600000000001s)]
*  psychedelic experience wouldn't be it wouldn't be it wouldn't be tenable. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1517.34s)]
*  They wouldn't be able to handle it. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1522.1799999999998s)]
*  You know that's possible. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1523.54s)]
*  There's a bunch of people that are they're in a bad state. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1524.54s)]
*  Maybe they're on a ton of medication just keeping them stable. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1528.6599999999999s)]
*  They can't do psychedelics. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1531.4599999999998s)]
*  Maybe them a non psychedelic version of that that rewired their brain would be beneficial. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1532.6599999999999s)]
*  Now that I think about it. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1537.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1538.4199999999998s)]
*  There is actually a situation with cluster headaches. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1539.4199999999998s)]
*  So cluster headaches are like suicide headaches. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1542.06s)]
*  They're worse than migraines. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1544.62s)]
*  There was this is now back around 2003. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1547.3s)]
*  A bunch of the people who had cluster headaches one of them went to a party did mushrooms [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1550.4199999999998s)]
*  and found that it postponed the cycle and would interrupt the cycle of these cluster [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1555.46s)]
*  headaches which are terrible. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1560.98s)]
*  And so they contacted me and they found formed this group called Cluster Busters and they [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1562.6599999999999s)]
*  said we don't want to be criminals anymore. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1568.1s)]
*  We would like to study this. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1569.8799999999999s)]
*  Can you help us study this? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1571.3s)]
*  And I live in Boston right next to McLean Hospital which is a part of Harvard Medical [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1572.54s)]
*  School and I approached them and I said would you want to study these people with cluster [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1577.3s)]
*  headaches and they said sure this is really interesting. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1582.8999999999999s)]
*  So they brought in all these people and check their medical records and and determine that [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1585.1599999999999s)]
*  this was really the case that that so I've been in LSD blocked cluster headache cycle [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1589.7s)]
*  and postponed the next cycle. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1597.34s)]
*  And so we did all this research and then the next step would have been to actually give [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1599.3999999999999s)]
*  LSD or psilocybin to people with cluster headaches and the people at Harvard like oh Timothy [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1606.56s)]
*  Leary he was here. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1610.9399999999998s)]
*  We don't want to do this. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1612.04s)]
*  You know damn it. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1613.7199999999998s)]
*  OK ultra all of that. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1614.7199999999998s)]
*  They ruined it for everybody. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1616.52s)]
*  Well we're trying to get over that but they did. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1618.6s)]
*  But then the people at Harvard said well we will do this LSD or psilocybin but only if [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1621.4399999999998s)]
*  it's the last resort. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1626.22s)]
*  Only if everything else fails. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1628.38s)]
*  So the scientists Torsten Passley and John Halpern decided that they would use a non-psychedelic [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1629.74s)]
*  version of LSD called bromo LSD and the plan was that they would give this bromo LSD to [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1636.8600000000001s)]
*  a bunch of people with cluster headaches. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1643.54s)]
*  It would not work and then they would come back and say hey we need to do this LSD and [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1645.02s)]
*  psilocybin research. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1649.58s)]
*  So I said OK that makes sense. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1651.66s)]
*  We have no idea why LSD or psilocybin works but it's probably connected to the psychedelic [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1652.92s)]
*  properties of it. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1657.66s)]
*  And so they did this study at Hanover University in Germany and I kept waiting for the results [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1659.5600000000002s)]
*  and waiting for the results and they wouldn't. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1664.04s)]
*  I heard nothing. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1666.64s)]
*  And then after months they finally said we didn't want to tell you but the bromo LSD [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1667.98s)]
*  works even better than the LSD and the psilocybin because with LSD you know it's effective in [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1672.3200000000002s)]
*  micrograms. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1679.3200000000002s)]
*  For psilocybin you take 25 milligrams for a major major trip but with bromo LSD you [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1681.48s)]
*  can give large amounts of it because you're not getting high. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1686.4s)]
*  And whatever it does it's still a mystery what it does in the brain but it works better [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1689.48s)]
*  you just flood the brain. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1694.5600000000002s)]
*  So that's actually a good example of a non-psychedelic psychedelic for a physiological problem that [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1696.44s)]
*  could make sense as a medicine. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1705.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah that makes a lot of sense. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1706.68s)]
*  It makes a lot of sense with the dose especially. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1708.1200000000001s)]
*  But that's great though at least that way like we found something out. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1711.04s)]
*  Yeah yeah and actually when I when they finally told me that it worked and that they didn't [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1714.72s)]
*  want to tell me I said you know I'm interested in psychedelic therapy if I'm also what's [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1719.92s)]
*  best for patients so that if this bromo LSD is best for patients that's great. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1725.66s)]
*  It's not upsetting me at all because we're talking about it anyway for a physiological [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1730.76s)]
*  thing and I'm interested in the therapy part of it. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1735.6s)]
*  And so unfortunately talk about being frustrating. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1739.26s)]
*  Kerry Turnbull is a philanthropist and he's trying to make bromo LSD into a medicine but [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1743.34s)]
*  he's been unable to raise all the funds that he needs to do that. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1749.3s)]
*  And so this was a treatment for a terrible disorder that was identified over about 20 [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1753.42s)]
*  years ago and it's still not been made into a medicine. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1759.54s)]
*  And so those are the things that are frustrating because it's not even psychedelic. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1763.76s)]
*  Right that's crazy. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1767.58s)]
*  It's just too close to psychedelic. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1768.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah it's too related by you know so my association. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1771.1s)]
*  Yeah so Morgan Drell was a big example to educate Rick Perry. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1775.86s)]
*  Morgan will be at the conference. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1780.1799999999998s)]
*  Congressman Jack Bergman who's leading an effort in Washington to have a group that's [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1781.82s)]
*  trying to collect a lot of support bipartisan support to make psychedelics into medicines [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1788.5s)]
*  will be there. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1793.8999999999999s)]
*  The military aspect of it is very important because they're generally very right wing [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1795.18s)]
*  guys and women. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1800.26s)]
*  You know they serve their country. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1802.22s)]
*  You know they're hard nosed disciplined people. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1804.7s)]
*  They can experience it. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1807.94s)]
*  They can realize you know I've always said that like I try to act as a bridge between [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1809.1000000000001s)]
*  the meatheads and the potheads. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1814.5s)]
*  You are a good bridge. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1817.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm the bridge. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1818.6200000000001s)]
*  Here I am. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1819.6200000000001s)]
*  Oh you know what Timothy Leary said which is phenomenal and tell me if this is true [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1820.6200000000001s)]
*  for you. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1824.54s)]
*  He said if you want to be a bridge you have to get used to being stepped on. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1825.54s)]
*  Oh that's for sure. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1830.14s)]
*  Yeah I'm pretty used to being stepped on. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1831.14s)]
*  Yeah but I mean not necessarily for those positions because the idea of pot and a lot [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1832.78s)]
*  of these other things is that it makes you lazy and you'd have a really hard time convincing [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1840.94s)]
*  anybody that I'm lazy. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1845.22s)]
*  That's very hard. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1847.06s)]
*  I'm pretty disciplined. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1848.06s)]
*  I don't believe that's the case. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1849.14s)]

*  eventually all this will be worked out and you know by the time I'm 35 or something like [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=1989.1s)]

*  You know the reef madness stuff and all that craziness that they pumped into people's heads [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2013.94s)]

*  There's still people today that believe all that stuff. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2023.06s)]
*  Well you just shared with me before we started talking about the Texas law that's trying [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2026.58s)]
*  to if you could maybe share about that. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2031.02s)]
*  Ken Paxton who I've met I like him very nice guy. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2033.9s)]
*  I don't know why he did this but Austin had decriminalized marijuana. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2037.54s)]
*  So apparently the attorney general's office sued Austin. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2043.62s)]
*  And what is the ruling on that. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2047.8999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if they even have acted on this or if they're going to appeal or what it is. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2050.74s)]
*  But like here's the thing about something that's not fully legal. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2056.02s)]
*  And I've talked about this before so I apologize to anybody who's heard this. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2062.54s)]
*  John Norris who's a friend of mine who's been on the podcast who was a game warden in California. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2065.42s)]
*  And he found a diverted stream and they were trying to figure out what's going on. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2072.06s)]
*  They figured some farmer fucked up and like what's going on here and like fish were dead. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2077.2599999999998s)]
*  And so he's a game warden. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2081.54s)]
*  So they have to track down what happened with this stream. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2082.9s)]
*  Finds this huge grow up in the middle of the national forest run by the cartel and then [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2085.94s)]
*  his entire operation in the decades future becomes a tactical force with bulletproof [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2090.78s)]
*  vests and dogs and guns fighting the cartel in the forest in national forest because they [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2097.54s)]
*  were growing it all in America and then just selling it like 90 percent. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2104.82s)]
*  I believe he said 90 percent of the marijuana that was sold in states where it's illegal [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2110.86s)]
*  was coming from California and they were using very dangerous pesticides and herbicides stuff [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2114.42s)]
*  that's completely illegal. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2120.3s)]
*  If you were growing it naturally if you were growing it normally. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2122.78s)]
*  Because it's illegal you have organized crime that's providing it to people like it. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2127.5s)]
*  If it was legal we could only buy it from like you buy your fucking groceries you buy [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2134.06s)]
*  organic fruit right you buy organic vegetables you buy organic marijuana you would know the [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2138.8599999999997s)]
*  people who are growing it. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2144.06s)]
*  You could meet the farmers just like you can meet people from white oak pastures you'd [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2145.4199999999996s)]
*  meet people from fucking the happy green farm and you would know where you're getting your [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2149.66s)]
*  stuff you know there's no fentanyl in it which is apparently they're talking about that now. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2154.62s)]
*  You're not helping anybody you're only hurting people. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2159.02s)]
*  Now if your goal is just to hurt as many people as possible yeah make more laws. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2162.06s)]
*  Yeah keep making keep locking people up lock people up for things that don't hurt anybody [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2165.42s)]
*  even themselves. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2169.9s)]
*  Well the other part of this is the tax money. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2171.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2173.58s)]
*  Two when you're letting all this money go to the underground to the cartels to the criminal [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2173.82s)]
*  gangs you're alternatively you could have it as taxes and it could make it easier on [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2179.98s)]
*  the rest of us. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2185.7400000000002s)]
*  I could see as an argument if you the attorney general and you said you are propping up [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2186.86s)]
*  organized crime by allowing it to be decriminalized and the people that are growing it selling [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2191.58s)]
*  it in Austin or the people that have it in Austin are all committing crime so they're [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2196.06s)]
*  probably cartel people or I could see that argument kind of but you know what the fucking [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2200.86s)]
*  solution to that is make it legal. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2207.9s)]
*  This is dumb. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2209.98s)]
*  We can just buy whiskey anywhere which I love nothing wrong with it but you can go but I [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2211.1800000000003s)]

*  we pay taxes for and you know the alcohol commission has to check make sure we're doing [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2225.98s)]
*  everything right but it's drugs and it's way more dangerous. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2230.38s)]
*  And prohibition of alcohol actually in the in the 20s led to organized crime in America. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2234.94s)]
*  Yes Al Capone all that stuff propped up organized but also led to NASCAR too. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2241.26s)]
*  Pretty cool they figured out how to soup up some cars to get away from the cops. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2248.2200000000003s)]
*  That's what NASCAR came from. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2252.54s)]
*  Did you know that? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2254.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2254.78s)]

*  with a you know drink at a social gathering there's nothing wrong with that. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2260.78s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with that. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2264.86s)]
*  Let people do what the fuck they want to do. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2266.06s)]
*  We're all going to die someday and if people are having good or bad experiences on any [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2267.9s)]
*  of these substances it's up to them to manage their experiences. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2273.34s)]
*  Like I don't get along with alcohol I won't drink alcohol I don't get along with marijuana [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2277.02s)]

*  It's dumb. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2288.54s)]
*  Well this idea that we're all going to die one day one of the most important uses of [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2290.1400000000003s)]
*  psychedelics is to help people at the end of life who are scared of dying and also for [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2294.22s)]
*  palliative care. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2300.2999999999997s)]
*  So there's a lot of research that's been done with people with life threatening illnesses [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2301.1s)]
*  who are anxious about dying and have received either MDMA or psilocybin or LSD in the 60s. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2305.2599999999998s)]
*  So that the kind of big fears that we have about illness and death when people are not [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2312.14s)]
*  able to process those fears it just gets worse and worse. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2318.22s)]
*  I wonder how many people Larry Hagman turned on. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2321.1s)]
*  You know what I mean that day on CNN there's probably millions of people watching Larry Hagman [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2324.9399999999996s)]
*  saying well I'm not afraid of death because I had an LSD experience and I realized that it's all [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2330.14s)]
*  just connected. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2335.02s)]
*  Yeah well if it wasn't for my mother-in-law reading his book you know and he became a big supporter of [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2335.98s)]

*  Yeah you know there's been some we have a lot of I live in Massachusetts where [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2348.62s)]
*  marijuana is legal. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2353.58s)]

*  economically. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2359.1s)]
*  Oh it's a huge tax boom especially like Colorado had the craziest taxes when it's like 39 percent [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2360.54s)]
*  or something at one point and everybody's like okay because it's first of all economically like [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2366.54s)]
*  if you want to go out for a night drinking that's going to cost you a couple hundred bucks you know [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2371.8199999999997s)]
*  buying a round of drinks for your friends and round drinks here there it's you a couple hundred [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2375.9s)]
*  dollars worth of marijuana you're stoned for a month like you're just stoned forever and if you [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2380.7s)]
*  have to pay 39 percent tax like okay like I hope it fixes streets like I'll give you my tax money [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2386.06s)]
*  I'm not scared of paying I want to pay taxes if you were doing good stuff with it is it helping [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2391.98s)]
*  pay for the schools great let's get great schools and a lot of people smoking weed legally but not [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2396.2999999999997s)]
*  kids you know that's the other thing like we need education for children to let them know like it's [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2401.58s)]
*  not good to alter your state of consciousness especially on a regular basis when you're young [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2405.9s)]
*  there's some developmental issues that come along with abuse well this is with abuse for sure abuse [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2410.7000000000003s)]
*  abuse definitely for sure one of the things that's pretty interesting is look at the cultures that [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2415.82s)]
*  have successfully integrated psychedelics like for example the ayahuasca churches that are in brazil [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2420.86s)]
*  or the native american church that uses peyote often for native americans that have problems [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2426.38s)]
*  with alcohol I was out on a navajo reservation this is about 20 years ago and it was for a [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2431.58s)]
*  native american church peyote ceremony and one of the navajo men brought his nine-year-old son [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2437.9s)]
*  to take peyote and spend the night with us whoa and peyote is mescaline right peyote is mescaline [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2443.9s)]
*  yeah and wachuma is from san pedro cactus is also that has mescaline in it but this nine-year-old [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2449.9s)]
*  did not take the same amount of peyote as the rest of us but he took more appropriate for his [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2456.78s)]
*  body weight and it's within a cultural context within a family context within a religious [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2461.9s)]
*  supportive context these cultures tend not to have age limits right so I think when you talk about [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2467.9s)]
*  the developmental problems that come from abuse that's totally the case but when you talk about [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2474.2200000000003s)]
*  occasional use for inspiration particularly when in a ceremonial in a ceremonial setting [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2480.46s)]
*  which has been for centuries and centuries they've refined it there's no neurological [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2486.94s)]
*  damage that comes to your brain from mescaline right this ceremonial settings are very important [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2491.58s)]
*  and I used to think it was foolishness I think ceremonies like get the fuck out of here with [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2497.9s)]
*  your ceremony I was cynical you know but I think that and even rites of passages like into adulthood [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2501.34s)]
*  I used to think that was foolish too but then I realized like wow a lot of people have a hard time [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2507.98s)]
*  determining if that they're an adult and they stay kind of infantile for their entire life [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2511.82s)]
*  and especially someone that's like really coddled by their parents and over overprotected helicopter [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2517.42s)]
*  parents you never develop the ability to be solitary and just to be out there on your own [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2522.38s)]
*  and autonomous and things that are important should be treated with respect and that's where [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2527.66s)]
*  I think ceremony comes in yeah one of the things that I think has led to my interest in lifetime [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2535.9s)]
*  use of psychedelics was been the failure of my bar mitzvah to to actually turn me into a man [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2541.7400000000002s)]
*  oh that's hilarious because I'm the thought you're going to be a man that's it I'm gonna be a man [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2548.54s)]
*  I was I wanted to avoid all the awkwardness of adolescence I'm the oldest of four kids [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2552.38s)]
*  so I had no older siblings to tell me and we did this rite of passage and it's been used for [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2557.6600000000003s)]
*  thousands of years and I just had this somehow this idea that there would be some [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2562.54s)]
*  visitation from God of some way that I would be one thing the morning of my bar mitzvah and I [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2568.14s)]
*  would be something different the next morning and I remember waking up in bed the next morning [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2573.5s)]
*  after my bar mitzvah and I'm like I'm the same this particular rite of passage didn't work and [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2579.9s)]
*  and you know you're 13 you're not so smart and I was like well you know God must be busy a lot of [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2585.9s)]
*  people got got bar mitzvah you know it's like Christmas and eventually God's gonna get to me [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2589.98s)]
*  yeah and so every day for a week I would wake up and think is today the day am I different [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2596.06s)]
*  nothing happened and then finally another week and another bar mitzvah saturday came along and I [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2602.46s)]
*  realized that if I was on a list I have now been dropped off the list completely because there's [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2607.58s)]
*  all these new people bar mitzvahed and and the rites of passage that we do have I believe probably [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2611.98s)]
*  worked in the past for a lot of people and they did have this demarcation between different ages [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2617.74s)]
*  people didn't used to live that long either so 13 was kind of a transition point right but it was [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2623.4199999999996s)]
*  when I was 17 almost 18 that I first did LST and my one of my very first thoughts was this is what [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2629.66s)]
*  my bar mitzvah should have been because you know you're like who am I right where do I fit in right [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2637.98s)]
*  I'm sort of my ego sense is dissolving a bit from LSD I'm connected to something bigger and larger [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2647.7400000000002s)]
*  than myself right I thought this is the the courage the test of courage this is the test of [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2653.5s)]
*  manhood this is something that is a part of a rite of passage so for me the psychedelics became [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2659.5s)]
*  the rite of passage when the religious rite of passage didn't have the same impact as I had hoped [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2665.74s)]
*  it would that's fascinating that's fascinating it's interesting too you talk about not restricting [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2672.22s)]
*  it for young people and I just I thought about like wine in Europe because kids in Europe [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2677.8199999999997s)]
*  particularly kids in Italy they don't have the drinking problem that kids have in America when [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2683.8999999999996s)]
*  high school kids in America get a hold of alcohol they get drunk and ridiculous and like it's because [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2689.58s)]
*  they're doing something naughty yeah but kids are normalized to the just regular consumption of [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2694.7s)]
*  glass of wine with dinner it's normal well and then in the US where when kids do experiment [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2701.4199999999996s)]
*  because they're worried about being caught with things they tend to not use wine but they tend to [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2708.3799999999997s)]
*  use stronger drinks right so they call that sort of the iron law of prohibition that when you [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2713.2599999999998s)]
*  prohibit something it moves more and more to more concentrated more powerful forms of that drop hence [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2718.54s)]
*  fentanyl yeah yeah or even cocaine when if you could have coca tea I mean Andy Weill has been [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2724.22s)]
*  promoting for decades and decades this idea of coca tea yeah I had that once what was the [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2730.9399999999996s)]
*  what did it feel like I couldn't shut up I was like oh my god thank god I've never done cocaine [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2736.7s)]
*  I was telling my friend Doug I was like I don't think I could shut up but it wasn't anything crazy [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2743.18s)]
*  I think that chewing the leaves is supposed to be like super beneficial and actually even [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2750.7799999999997s)]
*  healthier than coffee yeah there's a lot of nutrition in the leaves it helps fuck your [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2755.9s)]
*  teeth up though well if you do anything too much it can but it's something like an apologist you [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2761.34s)]
*  sound well well I think it's this idea that appropriate use well Paracelsus is the one of [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2768.38s)]
*  the early physicians and he said the difference between a medicine and a poison is dose right well [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2777.9s)]
*  yeah salt will kill you you know eat a pound of salt see what happens water will kill you yeah I [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2783.7400000000002s)]
*  mean people drink too much water yeah yeah hyponitremia you dilute your I remember a lady died [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2788.78s)]
*  because she was trying to win a playstation for a kid in a morning radio show she was trying to drink [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2793.5s)]
*  the most water oh crazy yeah like no who knew I guess no one knew then but people are pretty aware [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2797.9s)]
*  now because of frat parties like you know hazing they've had kids do that yeah that's one of the [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2805.58s)]
*  things that has been has been happening in terms of the raves and ecstasy use so that occasionally [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2812.22s)]
*  people will overheat and die from MDMA where you dance all night you don't drink adequate fluid [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2818.86s)]
*  and you can get hyperthermia and there are some cases so that's one of the dangers of ecstasy use [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2825.02s)]
*  outside of therapeutic context and so people have heard okay now I need to drink fluids in order to [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2830.3s)]
*  not overheat and there have been cases of people that have died from drinking too much water well I [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2836.6200000000003s)]
*  can counter that because there's a bunch of people that have died from too much exercise there's [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2840.6200000000003s)]
*  something called rhabdomyelosis that people get when you over exercise where you literally your [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2844.6200000000003s)]
*  protein starts breaking down your kidneys can't process it you start peeing brown it can be [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2849.1800000000003s)]
*  totally deadly you can push yourself too hard and die from exercise too yeah so many people [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2853.98s)]
*  every year die of rhabdo google that because I know it's it's very common in the crossfit world [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2860.14s)]
*  because people are competitive with exercise which is not necessarily the great like a lot of people [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2866.86s)]
*  I know that are trainers do not like the concept of crossfit because it's doing exercise that are [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2873.18s)]
*  just supposed to strengthen your body and condition your body but doing them in a competition setting [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2878.06s)]
*  where it's like unlimited amount of repetitions as many as you can get in you know x amount of [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2882.22s)]
*  time or you know and then they have these games where people play where they might not be conditioned [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2886.62s)]
*  enough to sustain the workload that they're putting forth and then they get rhabdo and it's [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2890.8599999999997s)]
*  fairly common like I know multiple people that have had rhabdo wow yeah how many people die so [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2896.62s)]
*  it doesn't say that but it says there's 26 000 cases reported annually and about five percent of [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2903.74s)]
*  those lead to mortality five to twenty percent that's a lot that's a lot of people that that's [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2908.7s)]
*  probably more than people drink water and die I guarantee that's more I bet drinking water so [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2913.8199999999997s)]
*  much water you die is probably fairly rare but I think that rhabdo stuff is super dangerous yeah [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2920.06s)]
*  you're reminding me of something funny David Nutt was the drug policy advisor for the British [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2926.3799999999997s)]
*  government and he did a ranking about the dangers of all these different drugs and what he found was [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2931.8999999999996s)]
*  that the psychedelics were at the very low end of the dangers and so he talked about how horseback [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2937.9s)]
*  riding was more dangerous than ecstasy oh yeah it's super dangerous man people fall and break [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2945.1800000000003s)]
*  things all the time yeah and so he got fired for that because for because he was telling the truth [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2953.1800000000003s)]
*  he was making people love horseback riding in England oh that's crazy so what maps did is that [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2958.54s)]
*  he got fired for telling the truth well he was the drug policy advisor saying things that people [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2965.02s)]
*  did not want to hear maybe should have like got his job districts and down before he started yapping [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2969.3399999999997s)]

*  similar we looked at cheerleading oh yeah and we looked at the emergency room visits on a per [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2985.4199999999996s)]
*  person visit for the the percentage of people that do cheerleading that go to the emergency room [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2993.1s)]
*  versus the percentage of people that do ecstasy and cheerleading is more dangerous oh yeah they [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=2997.2599999999998s)]
*  fly through the air man yeah they bang heads sometimes yeah yeah so we had a poster that we [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3002.8599999999997s)]
*  made it said uh give me an e oh god that's so silly but here's the thing it's like we allow multiple [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3008.54s)]

*  the critical issue is that people have got as you started up by saying you know people think that [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3060.54s)]
*  if you take these drugs there's no benefits you're hallucinating you're running away from reality [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3064.06s)]

*  you're going to fly out a window and think you can fly well it's just like we need a a comprehensive [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3071.42s)]
*  addressing of the the actual real landscape of what these things are what the benefits are and [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3077.02s)]
*  just this addressing of the impact of propaganda the the sweeping schedule one act of 1970 [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3085.66s)]
*  the the whole william randolph hearse connection to marijuana illegalization which was right after [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3094.7000000000003s)]

*  needs to be like comprehensively explained to the american public to reinform people because i think [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3106.7s)]
*  people are there they're they have the general population that doesn't listen to podcasts like [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3112.14s)]
*  this and doesn't get online and search these things you have these conceptions that are entirely [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3117.3399999999997s)]
*  formed by propaganda and they're they're not based on on real anecdotal experiences real science real [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3123.8999999999996s)]
*  data and the and also the the problem with that too is there's real side effects of some of these [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3130.86s)]
*  things those need to be understood how do you understand them well you have to make them legal [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3136.6200000000003s)]
*  and do tests and studies and maybe people have gene expressions that you know maybe they shouldn't [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3140.94s)]
*  be doing this thing but they can do that thing you know yeah i think this idea that for me how [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3145.9s)]
*  do we break through the wall of propaganda right and for me the idea has been we go to where the [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3152.46s)]
*  suffering is we go to where the science is and we try to make things first into medicines and i [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3157.1s)]
*  think that's where people are willing to listen when you have all this propaganda on all these fears [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3162.62s)]
*  it has to be that there's some corresponding benefit that's overwhelms your your sense of fear [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3168.46s)]
*  that that you're willing to take a look right and that's where you go to where the suffering is [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3173.5s)]
*  and that's where with post-traumatic stress disorder yeah i think one of the things that [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3177.74s)]
*  we've been able to do remarkably is with psychedelics they're one of the few things [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3181.66s)]
*  that are out of the culture wars these days there's bipartisan support for psychedelic research [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3186.8599999999997s)]
*  and it's because we went to where a lot of the suffering was sympathetic patients most of the [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3193.8199999999997s)]
*  people in our studies are are women survivors of sexual abuse most of the people with ptsd are women [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3199.98s)]
*  but most of the media attention goes to the veterans and people put veterans on a pedestal [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3205.42s)]
*  and if so many of them you know there's different estimates but it's you know 18 22 or more per day [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3210.86s)]
*  commit suicide and you can end up avoiding a lot of that by helping them process the traumas that [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3217.7400000000002s)]
*  they experience and again it's like we're talking about boards the bridge yeah that's the real [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3225.5s)]
*  bridge the bridge is these you know hard-nosed right-wing guys who have these experiences [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3229.42s)]
*  become better parents become better friends just like reintegrate into society make peace [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3235.02s)]
*  with the past it's it's totally possible and that these tools are being so underutilized to so many [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3240.46s)]
*  vulnerable and needy people so many people just fucking need some help yeah one of the speakers [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3247.34s)]
*  at the psychedelic science conference is sherif el-nahal who was the undersecretary of the va [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3252.94s)]
*  wow and he's become very passionate about what he's seen from those people that have done [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3258.06s)]
*  the veterans that have done mdma assisted therapy inside the veterans administration but it took [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3266.06s)]
*  maps 25 years starting in 1995 we're offering money to the va to do mdma research until 2021 [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3270.7000000000003s)]
*  when the first veteran received mdma inside the va from va therapists wow so talk about frustration [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3280.78s)]
*  think about the number of people that have committed suicide from when we started offering [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3288.2200000000003s)]
*  to the va to do it but it was the propaganda it was the stigma that made it so that they were not [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3292.54s)]
*  willing to do it what's most amazing today is that congress gave 10 million dollars to the [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3297.58s)]
*  department of defense for mdma assisted therapy research in active duty soldiers oh wow so there's [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3303.34s)]
*  a 4.9 million dollar grant that went to a dr erin wolfgang at walter reed and it's going to be [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3310.94s)]
*  giving mdma assisted therapy there's another 4.9 million dollar grant that went to a group called [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3316.7799999999997s)]
*  strong star that's in san antonio here in texas elsewhere and they're connected with emory university [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3322.46s)]
*  and so they're going to combine mdma with a therapy called prolonged exposure where you talk about [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3328.7s)]
*  the trauma over and over but that's very re traumatizing there was a study that the veterans [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3334.78s)]
*  administration did that took them about six years it was 916 veterans and it compared two therapies [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3340.2200000000003s)]
*  that they use both non-drug therapies for treating ptsd one was called prolonged exposure the other [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3346.86s)]
*  was cognitive processing therapy and what they showed is that around half the people are in the [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3353.26s)]
*  study drop out because the therapy itself is re traumatizing because you're just forced to go [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3358.78s)]
*  over the trauma over the trauma over and over and that's supposed to desensitize you and if you can [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3365.02s)]
*  stay in it it can be helpful but it re traumatizes so many people so what we've shown is working with [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3371.18s)]
*  the mdma with the veterans is that they're able to process the trauma that the the fear reduction [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3377.58s)]
*  from the mdma reducing activity in the amygdala the fear processing is part of our brain that you [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3384.8599999999997s)]
*  can once you can approach these things that have felt like will tear you apart that they'll be [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3390.22s)]
*  overwhelming you can't really go away from them but they never really leave either that then you [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3396.78s)]
*  can process it so this study that will be done here in texas with active duty soldiers again is [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3402.5400000000004s)]
*  going to be a combination of mdma with prolonged exposure the walter reed study is combining mdma [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3408.78s)]
*  with what they call acceptance and commitment therapy different kind of approaches and so they [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3415.98s)]
*  decide which approach well this is going to be research trying to different different kinds of [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3421.98s)]
*  we do multiple ones just see what's the most effective yeah yeah and and i think that [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3429.02s)]
*  maps has started funding studies combining mdma with cognitive processing therapy as well but [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3434.94s)]
*  the one that i think is the most potentially the most valuable is called cognitive behavioral [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3442.06s)]
*  conjoined therapy conjoined means couples or diets and so what happens is the designated patient [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3447.34s)]
*  the veteran with ptsd is where the attention is focused but when they have ptsd it affects their [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3453.9s)]
*  families it affects their partners and so cognitive behavioral conjoined therapy was developed by this [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3460.78s)]
*  woman candace monsoon at the boston va and that's where they bring in the partner as well as the [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3465.82s)]
*  veteran and they both get therapy and so back in 2014 when finally i was working with richard [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3472.22s)]
*  rockefeller and his cousin senator jay rockefeller who was on the senate veterans affairs committee [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3480.14s)]
*  and they finally convinced the fda i mean the va to be willing to let maps support research with [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3484.7s)]
*  mdma they said that they would not let it they wouldn't refer veterans they couldn't do it inside [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3490.3799999999997s)]
*  the va we had to pay for it but that the first thing they wanted us to do was combine mdma with [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3495.5s)]
*  cognitive behavioral conjoined therapy where both people now get mdma and the results were better [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3500.14s)]
*  than anything they've ever got before in studying this therapy both in reduction of ptsd but also in [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3505.58s)]
*  strength of the relationship do they combine it with 5 hdp or anything like that to sort of [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3511.5s)]
*  bring back your levels the answer is no people do use 5 hdp and it can be helpful but explain what [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3518.8599999999997s)]
*  that does yeah so 5 hdp is your precursor for serotonin so when we started research with the [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3527.98s)]
*  fda this was now 1992 the very first time that they permitted mdma research was 1992 and as i [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3534.54s)]
*  said mdma had been used as a therapy drug since the the middle 70s through the the 80s criminalized [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3542.3s)]
*  in 85 and people have felt that sometimes and i think it's it's very much the case that you're [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3548.38s)]
*  tired after mdma that people talk about a serotonin depletion right and so when you take 5 hdp [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3554.54s)]
*  that can be helpful but when we started with the fda they said all this information that you've [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3561.42s)]
*  got from before from underground use or from before when it was still legal doesn't matter to us really [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3568.54s)]
*  everything has to be done under direct supervision of fda proof studies and they said don't assume [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3574.3s)]
*  that you're going to have problems and you're going to use mdma plus 5 hdp or something just [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3579.5s)]
*  start with the mdma see what problems you get and then then you can start so the way we think [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3584.06s)]
*  the way we think about uh mdma therapy is that it's really not a one day thing it's a two day [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3590.22s)]
*  in the sense that the second day is for rest it's for having no obligations no appointments [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3596.7s)]
*  and the therapists come back and do more integrative therapy the next day and also we do the therapy [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3602.7s)]
*  during the day it starts at 10 in the morning it's an eight hour session so often people can get [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3608.62s)]
*  sleep that night and we don't see more low mood or more tiredness in the people that get mdma than [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3613.58s)]
*  in the people that got therapy without mdma so we were never um felt that the need to introduce 5 [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3621.34s)]
*  hdp we didn't have evidence of symptoms that required this but i think it's because we talk [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3628.54s)]
*  about it as a two-day experience the the other part is that when people um take mdma at raves or [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3635.74s)]
*  parties and things like that often they're drinking they do it at night they don't get [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3641.2599999999998s)]
*  full sleep the next day they don't just take the day off often they go into activities right and [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3645.3399999999997s)]
*  so exhausted and they're exhausted yeah and so i think that this concept that we've developed is [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3652.14s)]
*  this really thinking about it as a two-day experience where there is this um low energy [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3657.66s)]
*  and there is but it's can be productive in terms of trying to work on the issues that came up [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3663.74s)]
*  during the mdma experience or the ptsd or depression or whatever it is that right now there's a um a [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3669.18s)]
*  project at a place called sunstone which is a therapy center center outside in rockville maryland [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3675.8999999999996s)]
*  and they've worked with cancer patients who are anxious about dying and they have brought in their [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3681.58s)]
*  partners to the therapy and both of them get mdma as well so these are all under um FDA approved [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3687.3399999999997s)]
*  studies and they found that that was tremendously effective as well because when your partner has [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3693.5s)]
*  got a life-threatening illness it doesn't just affect them it affects you as well and often the [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3698.14s)]
*  therapy is focused again on the designated patient so this kind of broadening the sense of who it is [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3703.98s)]
*  that is going to be treated and bringing in people's partners i think is going to be very [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3711.02s)]
*  important um one of the works the marcus and amber capone who've done work with vets they've [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3716.54s)]
*  brought probably by now about a thousand veterans down to mexico for ibogaine and they have also [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3723.9s)]
*  started bringing their partners as well they realize that you need to think about this as a [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3731.58s)]
*  family setting and to try to treat the entire family context this raises another issue which is [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3736.62s)]
*  to talk about group therapy so the scale of the trauma in america there's 13 million ptsd patients [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3744.54s)]
*  this is the estimate by the veterans administration you know in ukraine we've got an entire country [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3752.2999999999997s)]
*  when i was there practically every family knows someone or has someone that has been injured or [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3757.58s)]
*  or killed and so you've got massive population based trauma and to think about treating people [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3763.18s)]
*  as individuals is really important but it's going to be heard to scale because of the limited number [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3770.7799999999997s)]
*  of therapists and psychiatrists and the cost of doing that so the fda has wanted all the research [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3776.86s)]
*  with lsd psilocybin mdma 5 mdmt to start on an individual basis but there's new studies now that [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3782.7000000000003s)]
*  are going to be working on group therapy so one of the first in america was at the portland oregon va [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3790.7000000000003s)]
*  and it was four therapists for six veterans um and it started out where each one got an individual [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3797.9s)]
*  session first and then they get a group session and there's two basic kinds of trauma in the [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3804.46s)]
*  military one is war related or accident training related and the other is what they call military [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3810.86s)]
*  sexual trauma there's a lot of sexual abuse by veterans or by military active duty people of [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3816.38s)]
*  other people in the in the military and they call that military sexual trauma and so what they've [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3822.38s)]
*  learned is they have to separate those groups when they do the group therapy because if you're a [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3828.14s)]
*  military person who's been abused by other people in the military that that you might not feel safe [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3832.86s)]
*  if you're in a context of group therapy so they've done separate the groups but they found that the [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3838.1400000000003s)]
*  the groups do terrific with supporting each other afterwards in this integration process and so [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3844.3s)]
*  what they've done is they've realized though that the design they had initially was an individual [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3852.46s)]
*  session and then a group session and after they did two cohorts of the six they realized that [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3857.1s)]
*  the people felt they needed a third MDMA session and they wanted that also as a group not as an [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3863.1s)]
*  individual there's a project in Australia that's going to be climate related PTSD from floods [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3868.46s)]
*  that they've had related to climate and so they're going to be doing group therapy there [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3877.42s)]
*  and there's an incredible project that's developing in Israel that's for people traumatized on October [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3882.22s)]
*  7th and there's going to be groups of seven with two therapists two assistants but the Ministry of [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3889.1s)]
*  Health has taken a while to review this application it's funded by charitable donations the MDMA is [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3896.94s)]
*  coming from Canada but what the Ministry of Health in Israel has wanted is and this is the first study [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3905.18s)]
*  ever where it's going to be direct comparison of individual therapy versus group therapy so everybody [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3911.1s)]
*  is ready to have one or the other you get randomized to either individual or group [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3917.58s)]
*  and it will be a direct comparison and so I think like when we think about AA and we think about [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3923.2599999999998s)]
*  peer support I think you can go deeper when it's individual therapy because you have more focus [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3929.18s)]
*  you're not thinking about other people you can go deeper but when you're in a group setting you can [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3936.86s)]
*  kind of bond with the other people you can kind of hear their other stories but then you can support [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3941.74s)]
*  each other in this integration process so I think at the end of it it could be that the groups do [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3947.02s)]
*  just as well as the individuals and then that will dramatically reduce the cost of the treatment and [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3953.1s)]
*  help it scale so that's where we're at this initial thing and I think particularly for [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3960.14s)]
*  military people that are traumatized in similar circumstances that are bonded in groups that group [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3965.5s)]
*  therapy can maybe even be the treatment of choice but I think the way the FDA is going to be [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3971.34s)]
*  reviewing it is that there is going to be studies with individuals first that will have to be [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3976.7s)]
*  gone through the system and approved and then there will be this additional research with groups [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3984.3799999999997s)]
*  what kind of a timeline are we talking about like how long are these studies well it's going to be [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3989.1s)]
*  about three years for the project in Israel I mean it's going to be about 160 people what about the [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3993.8199999999997s)]
*  projects here the the project at the Portland Oregon VA is going to be done pretty soon but [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=3999.58s)]
*  it's really just been four or five cohorts it's very small numbers of people and so there will [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4004.54s)]
*  need to be more I think that there's been some efforts to do what people call in some ways a [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4009.82s)]
*  modified version of individual versus group is that they've done some of this at Sunstone also [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4018.22s)]
*  where there'll be four people getting psilocybin at the same time but each in a separate room each [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4024.14s)]
*  with one therapist but then near the end of the session they bring them together and then they [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4029.66s)]
*  talk about what happened and then they also have the group integration so it's kind of a modified [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4035.18s)]
*  so I think in terms of time frame it's probably four or five years before FDA will approve [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4039.98s)]
*  group therapy maybe longer the the other issue is that the last time that we spoke it was before [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4048.54s)]
*  the FDA advisory committee and before the FDA meeting to decide whether to approve MDMA-assisted [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4055.3399999999997s)]
*  therapy for PTSD and the advisory committee recommended against it and the FDA voted against [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4061.58s)]
*  it this was August of last year and so that was heartbreaking because I thought that the data [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4067.58s)]
*  really did justify approval and it did demonstrate safety and efficacy but there was enough doubts [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4075.58s)]
*  that were raised one of the big problems to do research with psychedelics is how do you do a [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4084.3s)]
*  double blind study right you know when you take a powerful drug you know you've taken it and if you [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4091.5s)]
*  give an inactive placebo people can tell the difference a lot of my dissertation which I did [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4098.14s)]
*  in 2001 was how to do a double blind study with psychedelics particularly with MDMA and I my my [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4106.14s)]
*  solution which made sense was to do therapy with low dose MDMA versus therapy with full dose MDMA [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4114.46s)]
*  so everybody knows they're getting MDMA they all have the same expectations and they might not be [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4123.34s)]
*  aware though which dose you know is it a full dose is it a lower dose so the challenge was [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4130.7s)]
*  to pick the low dose so that it's high enough to cause a certain amount of confusion but not so high [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4136.7s)]
*  that it has so much therapeutic potential that you can't tell the difference between the groups [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4141.98s)]
*  so for 16 years from 2000 to 2016 MAPS did a series of what are called phase two studies to [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4147.66s)]
*  try to figure out how to do phase three and we looked at therapy with no MDMA therapy with [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4154.62s)]
*  25 milligrams 30 milligrams 40 50 75 100 125 and 150 so sort of like a dose response we did all [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4159.34s)]
*  these different doses and what we discovered fortunately after I got my PhD was that my theory [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4167.26s)]
*  was partially right and partially wrong that you know a microdose of anything is not going to be [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4174.9400000000005s)]
*  very good as a placebo because you'll be able to tell so what was surprising to us was that [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4182.22s)]
*  the lower doses 25 30 40 50 milligrams did indeed cause a certain amount of confusion [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4189.66s)]
*  but when you're working with PTSD patients and you get this activation from the drug but you [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4197.18s)]
*  don't have enough of the fear reduction it made people uncomfortable so we showed that the people [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4202.860000000001s)]
*  that got therapy with no MDMA did better than the people that got therapy with the low doses of MDMA [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4208.78s)]
*  they still got better but they didn't get as much benefit so the the analogy is you're taking off [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4215.34s)]
*  in an airplane and there's all this turbulence at the beginning and then you get above the clouds [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4220.06s)]
*  and it's smooth sailing so it's it's kind of like that with with MDMA but the part that we discovered [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4224.06s)]
*  that was very surprising was we did a study with veterans firefighters and police officers and one [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4229.900000000001s)]
*  group got 30 milligrams one group got 75 milligrams and one group got 125 milligrams and in that [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4235.82s)]
*  particular study when you it was about 26 people when you randomize it doesn't mean that everything's [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4243.5s)]
*  equal it just means it's random so the people that had 125 milligrams with PTSD had more depression [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4250.86s)]
*  than the people that had 75 milligrams but the 75 milligram dose group did better than the 125 [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4257.66s)]
*  interest just slightly better so what it meant was that the dose that's therapeutically effective [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4263.26s)]
*  was lower than we thought can i stop you for a second yeah please when you said the people that [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4269.26s)]
*  did 125 had more depression yeah do you mean before the study yes yes okay so they were yes so [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4272.46s)]
*  it was chosen that they would get the higher dose because they were suffering more well well no again [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4278.62s)]
*  this is randomization right but you said that they had more depression before the therapy well so how [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4283.66s)]
*  did you determine that well well we evaluate everybody's ptsd symptoms and their depression [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4289.82s)]
*  symptoms and so just by the randomization it turned out that those people that were higher on [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4294.86s)]
*  depression ended up more of them in the hundreds randomly randomly yeah oh interesting yeah because [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4300.7s)]
*  when you randomize again it doesn't mean that you're making things equal right right right so it was [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4306.38s)]
*  just a chance just turned out that turned out how many people were in this group 26 people were in [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4312.139999999999s)]
*  the entire study okay so it's just dumb luck yeah okay yeah but it meant to us that this dose of 75 [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4317.099999999999s)]
*  was indeed more therapeutic than we anticipated so there was no real sweet spot where there was [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4324.139999999999s)]
*  a dose of mdma that didn't either make people uncomfortable and reduce the effectiveness compared [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4330.22s)]
*  to therapy with no mdma or it tipped over into being very effective so when in november 29 2016 [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4336.780000000001s)]
*  when the fda had what we call the end of phase two meeting after we got approved to go to phase [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4347.02s)]
*  three the final studies where you need to prove safety and efficacy i knew that we shouldn't do [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4354.22s)]
*  that because of this we shouldn't go directly to phase three the fda offers this opportunity that [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4359.66s)]
*  most pharma companies don't take called special protocol assessment and you negotiate every aspect [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4366.3s)]
*  of the phase three design with fda and it can take for us it took eight months and so pharma [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4372.62s)]
*  companies are thinking there's nothing unusual what i'm doing my patent life is expiring but i [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4378.78s)]
*  knew we needed to do that to discuss how to deal with the double blind and so we presented this [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4383.82s)]
*  information to the fda we said we will give you blinding if you want with these lower doses but [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4388.7s)]
*  it's going to make our job easier to find a difference between the full dose and these lower [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4393.34s)]
*  doses because it's going to compromise the therapy as compared to therapy with no mdma at all and so [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4399.9s)]
*  we said to the fda you tell us what you want and the fda chose therapy with inactive placebo to make [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4406.0599999999995s)]
*  our job harder which made sense to me and they said that there's two things that you can do to [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4412.46s)]
*  reduce experiment or bias because the whole purpose of the double blind is to sort of reduce [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4418.54s)]
*  bias that you don't know what's going on and everybody just treats everybody the same they [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4423.42s)]
*  said the first is this random assignment what that means is everybody's similarly motivated [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4427.74s)]
*  and they will work and the therapists don't know necessarily that so you do this random assignment [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4432.86s)]
*  but then the second thing is that you can't have the therapists or the patients rate themselves on [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4439.18s)]
*  how well they've done compared to baseline you need independent raters that are blind to the [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4444.46s)]
*  condition that the person that they're evaluating is in so the raters don't know did this person get [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4450.86s)]
*  the placebo did this person get the mdma it's just don't look at their pupils well well this [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4457.18s)]
*  is afterwards but that's right and it's done on telemedicine it's done on on zoom and it's an [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4464.54s)]
*  hour-long interview and it's with what's called the caps the clinician administered ptsd scale [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4470.54s)]
*  and do they have a series of questions yeah yeah it's like an hour-long interview about their [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4476.54s)]
*  symptoms related to what they call the index trauma which is the worst thing that ever happened you [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4481.42s)]
*  pick this this is my index trauma and how do you respond so we had these independent raters [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4487.9s)]
*  and then we had this random assignment and that's what the fda said is how we should do the phase [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4494.14s)]
*  three studies what was problematic for us was the people at the fda that we negotiated this with [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4499.26s)]
*  in 2017 then left the fda and then new more conservative people came in at the division [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4505.58s)]
*  of psychiatry and they made they were more concerned about this what they called functional [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4511.1s)]
*  unblinding and that became an issue at the fd advisory committee meeting and at the fda [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4516.22s)]
*  when they reviewed what what whether to approve mdma assisted therapy or not [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4523.9s)]
*  and so the the pharma company lycos did not really proactively explain to the advisory committee [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4529.099999999999s)]
*  how this design was developed why fda chose this design and so the people in the advisory committee [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4538.379999999999s)]
*  are often more academics and they're more focused on this double blind issue but they're they're not [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4545.66s)]
*  practical in a sense so that the fda realizes that the double blind fails in practice a lot it's it's [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4551.58s)]
*  a theory of how you want to do things it's something to strive for but it doesn't work a lot of the [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4557.74s)]
*  times even with ssris you think that prozac or various drugs that you take that are not psychedelic [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4563.0199999999995s)]
*  that those are easy to double blind but they're not because when people have sexual side effects [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4570.14s)]
*  they have other side effects and they report to their therapist what's going on then they can tell [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4575.5s)]
*  from the side effect profile so the double blind fails in practice a lot but the fda is is saying [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4581.5s)]
*  we can't just only approve drugs where the double line is perfect there's we have to weigh these [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4588.06s)]
*  different things so that was one of the big issues that the fd advisory committee objected to was [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4593.34s)]
*  this functional unblinding so when you asked about the time frame there was other issues but where [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4600.3s)]
*  we're at right now is that there's going to be negotiations between lycos and the fda [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4605.98s)]
*  with the new fda with the new people at hhs and there's two the proverbial fork in the road [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4616.0599999999995s)]
*  there's either the fda will say we believe your data enough that you're not going to need to do [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4622.94s)]
*  another phase three study they might require what's called a phase four study which is after [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4630.7s)]
*  approval you gather information about safety about durability different things and if that's the case [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4636.7s)]
*  it's possible that within six months the fda could say yes to approving mdma assisted therapy for ptsd [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4644.3s)]
*  if the fda says we want another phase three study that could delay approval for another three and [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4650.94s)]
*  a half years or so so and that's just on an individual basis wow so then so talk about [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4657.5s)]
*  frustration yeah i mean we had incredible outcomes so the two phase three studies that were done [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4663.74s)]
*  the first one was severe ptsd and what we showed is that um two-thirds of the people [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4670.38s)]
*  that had severe ptsd no longer had ptsd after the treatment which was 42 hours of therapy three [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4678.38s)]
*  mdma sessions one month apart 12 90 minute non-drug psychotherapy sessions um two-thirds no longer [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4686.06s)]
*  had ptsd that got therapy plus mdma and those people that got therapy without mdma with the [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4693.9800000000005s)]
*  inactive placebo roughly one-third no longer had ptsd and then another um 20 roughly um 20 had what's [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4699.660000000001s)]
*  called um clinically significant reductions of ptsd symptoms means that their life has changed [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4709.5s)]
*  their symptoms are not as burdensome but they still have ptsd so they're called responders so [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4715.9s)]
*  we had 88 responders only 12 non-responders wow it was it's it's the best treatment in the second [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4720.78s)]
*  phase three study we purposely moved it to moderate to severe ptsd because we didn't want the fda to [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4728.06s)]
*  say it's only for severe ptsd three-quarters of the people did have severe ptsd um and um [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4734.62s)]
*  one quarter had moderate ptsd and it was 72.6 percent no longer had ptsd almost three-quarters [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4742.78s)]
*  no longer had ptsd at this two-month follow-up and what was even more remarkable and this relates [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4750.46s)]
*  i think to the concerns that was expressed about bias and functional unblinding is that 46 percent [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4757.099999999999s)]
*  of the people that had therapy with no mdma also went below the threshold of having a ptsd diagnosis [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4763.26s)]
*  that's better than any of the other therapies for ptsd and so what that demonstrated is that [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4770.780000000001s)]
*  the therapists even though most of them could tell the difference between whether somebody had mdma [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4776.38s)]
*  or not that they tried just as hard as they could to help people whether they got the mdma or not [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4781.42s)]
*  and we got extraordinary results in the control group and i think one of the things that is the [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4788.54s)]
*  explanation is that when you have an eight-hour therapy session with music with headphones with [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4794.54s)]
*  more or less half the time people are inside having these different um feelings and the other half [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4799.98s)]
*  they're talking to the therapists in no particular order you're not forced to focus on the the therapy [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4805.26s)]
*  the way with prolonged exposure or cognitive processing therapy that that's what i said was [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4812.62s)]
*  re-traumatizing in the studies that the va did roughly half the people dropped out we had very [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4817.82s)]
*  low dropout rates because people are encouraged to just we support whatever's emerging that's the [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4822.46s)]
*  essence of the therapeutic approach that has been developed to support people when they're going [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4828.219999999999s)]
*  through mdma therapy and it's very similar to what can be done with psilocybin or lsd or even [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4833.42s)]
*  ibogaine that that you just support whatever's emerging you have this sense that there's a [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4838.62s)]
*  wisdom of the unconscious we all know that our body has a certain wisdom in that it it moves [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4842.54s)]
*  towards wholeness we get cuts it heals it's below our level of awareness so there's some kind of [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4847.58s)]
*  wisdom to what's emerging you could think about it as this barrier this permeable barrier semi-permeable [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4853.26s)]
*  barrier between the conscious and the unconscious and it all happens we all know at dreams that the [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4860.46s)]
*  material rises to our awareness at dreams and it's like that with psychedelics and so we just [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4864.46s)]
*  support whatever's emerging and people can go to some happy memories or to layers of trauma [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4870.54s)]
*  whatever they're not forced to just focus on the trauma so we have very low dropout rates [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4876.3s)]
*  but the people that got the therapy without mdma were able to make incredible progress [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4882.54s)]
*  we also have what are called fidelity ratings which is we videotape all the sessions [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4887.98s)]
*  um and then we have raters are called adherence raters and they look at our people adhering to the [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4893.5s)]
*  therapeutic method and then that's called fidelity we had over 90 fidelity meaning that the therapists [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4900.860000000001s)]
*  really were doing the same whether it was a placebo or not so the results were outstanding [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4907.02s)]
*  in that way and the side effects were very low we had nobody commit suicide that received mdma [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4913.34s)]
*  that was one of the concerns we had one woman tried to kill herself twice but she was in the [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4920.3s)]
*  placebo group and we had another woman such severe suicidal ideation she checked herself into a [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4926.14s)]
*  hospital not to kill herself she was also in the placebo group because when you help people with [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4931.66s)]
*  terrible trauma it's difficult for them and you know they're not able to to really process that's [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4936.46s)]
*  why they had long-term ptsd so we demonstrated remarkable results and yet the fta said we need [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4943.26s)]
*  more data we need more data um i i think it's tragic it is tragic but it's also very hopeful [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4952.38s)]
*  the results the results are very hopeful and you know i'm always hoping that people come around [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4961.34s)]
*  do you ever really consider though the the burden of responsibility that lays on your [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4966.54s)]
*  shoulders like you have been at the forefront of this for decades and i imagine a world where [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4971.98s)]
*  a guy like you doesn't exist because it's real easy for you to not exist i only know you you know [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4979.259999999999s)]
*  i'm saying like you have been responsible for so much research and so much pushing for legislation [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4985.0199999999995s)]
*  to be passed and pushing for people to understand these things and so much education i mean you're [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4991.259999999999s)]
*  a real hero in this thank you yeah it's um but it required it must have been an incredible amount of [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=4996.94s)]
*  resolve that you have to have to keep this fight going on it has been and i think one of the things [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5004.78s)]
*  that was um has kept me going was a dream we've talked about dreams a little bit it was a dream [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5010.0599999999995s)]
*  that i had when i was in my early 20s so when i was 18 you know i i had decided to focus my life on [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5015.179999999999s)]
*  psychedelics this was after i realized oh lsd is what my bar mitzvah should have been and i was able [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5022.3s)]
*  to um see these tools as really hopeful and there was two parts one part is sort of this [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5028.3s)]
*  working through trauma depression the other part is our interconnectedness i think this the sort [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5035.74s)]
*  of the essence of what people talk about the sort of spiritual aspects of psychedelics or of meditation [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5040.54s)]
*  or of other things you feel that we're not just isolated individuals we're connected with all of [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5046.54s)]
*  life and so at 18 i said it's a crazy world that was a vietnam war draft resistor i was planning [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5051.18s)]
*  to go to jail i'd studied tolstoy and gandhi and non-violent resistance so my contribution to my [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5058.38s)]
*  country was going to be to not register for the draft and go to jail as a protest for vietnam [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5065.9800000000005s)]
*  and then i thought you know my dad was and my mom was saying you're going to have a criminal record [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5071.9800000000005s)]
*  you're never going to have a real job you're not going to be able to be a doctor or lawyer you'll [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5076.06s)]
*  be a felon and i thought okay well i'm not willing to to go to work because of that but [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5079.5s)]
*  i can be an underground psychedelic therapist and you don't need a license for that so that that was [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5086.38s)]
*  my plan so then this dream happened in my early 20s i should mention that i was so um i had the [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5091.5s)]
*  real wrong idea um at 18 is the idea i had was the more drugs you take the faster you evolve [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5099.34s)]
*  so i mean again i was you know stupid 18 year old so so i i did a good job of it [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5106.14s)]
*  and i just got more disoriented and very much um ungrounded too much horsepower not enough [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5115.42s)]
*  traction that's a great way to say it yeah i was very ungrounded and and and i went to the guidance [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5121.98s)]
*  counselor at college and this was a new college in sarasota florida and it was a private school [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5127.98s)]
*  at the time and the guidance counselor i said i need help with my dripping and uh it's become [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5134.62s)]
*  more important to me than my studies and he said well you know i understand what you're doing that's [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5139.74s)]
*  really makes sense to me in some ways we're over developed intellectually and underdeveloped [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5143.74s)]
*  emotionally and spiritually and he gave me this book to read and i loved it and it was by stanislaw [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5148.3s)]
*  groff the world's expert lsd researcher and he was md phd at johns hopkins this is now 1972 [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5154.0599999999995s)]
*  and the research was being shut down you talked about the controlled substances act of 1970 [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5161.18s)]
*  and my guidance counselor had got this book directly from stan and um i said could i write [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5166.14s)]
*  a letter to stan i want to become a lsd therapist and um he said sure so i wrote this letter and [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5172.38s)]
*  stan was just leaving hopkins and i'm this confused 18 year old and and to my shock stan wrote me back [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5178.06s)]
*  stan is now by the way um almost 94 years old [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5183.740000000001s)]
*  um and um he is um still going around the world to to educate people but this book was um the [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5190.86s)]
*  pivot point in my life reading this i said i really want to study psychedelics so the dream was a few [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5201.42s)]
*  years later um if if people have seen the movie 2001 space odyssey near the end of it there's [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5206.78s)]
*  this scene where the astronaut is in this all-white room and he's on his deathbed [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5215.18s)]
*  and so the dream was i'm in this all-white room on this and there's a person on his deathbed and he's [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5219.66s)]
*  um looking at me he said earlier in my life i was almost uh killed but i was saved and i knew i was [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5225.820000000001s)]
*  saved for a purpose but i didn't know what the purpose was he said let me show you what happened [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5233.26s)]
*  to me so this is all in the dream so we go and it's in world war two and he was a jewish guy and [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5237.58s)]
*  it was outside of a village and there was all these thousands of people lined up with open grave [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5244.78s)]
*  machine gunned by the nazis before the crematoriums and the concentration camps they called it the [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5249.66s)]
*  holocaust of bullets so this guy was wounded buried but wasn't dead and then it had a little bit of a [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5255.5s)]
*  jesus kind of a theme where he was buried for three days somehow i'm seeing all this through his eyes [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5264.139999999999s)]
*  and then he wakes up and he's not dead he climbs his way through the bodies and nobody's there at [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5269.58s)]
*  the edge of town he runs into the woods he survives the war with the partisans and then i see all this [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5273.42s)]
*  and then we're back in the room and he's on his deathbed and he's looking at me and he says now [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5280.14s)]
*  i know why i was saved i'm like oh tell me why were you saved he said it's to tell you to study [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5284.46s)]
*  psychedelics that i want you to bring back psychedelics that if we can all feel our [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5290.38s)]
*  interconnectedness it will be harder to dehumanize others it'll be harder to [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5295.5s)]
*  do this mass murder that that we need to understand how we're we're we're all more similar than different [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5299.26s)]
*  and at the i said in my mind again in the dream i said i've already decided to do this this is sort [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5308.06s)]
*  of reinforcing it i will say yes and you can die in peace you will have carried this message [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5315.26s)]
*  and then he dies in front of my arms in front of my eyes and then after he's on his he's dead and [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5320.22s)]
*  then i'm thinking what do i do next and i walk out the the room and now i'm somehow rather on a stream [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5326.14s)]
*  i'm sitting down watching the water go by and then i noticed that there's this young boy sitting [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5333.5s)]
*  next to me and i look at him and i realize i know him in real life at the time i had a big lsd stash [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5338.860000000001s)]
*  and i was worried about getting busted and so his father was a friend of mine and he stored my lsd [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5345.900000000001s)]
*  stash at his house and and when i connected this guy with this little kid with lsd then i woke up [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5351.18s)]
*  so that's what's been a big motivator for me my entire life and made it so that i don't feel that [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5359.1s)]
*  i've been able to just give up it's like this sort of message from what humanity can do to each other [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5366.62s)]
*  if we don't really evolve in our consciousness and so that that's what's helped me to to continue [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5375.58s)]
*  i feel this enormous for good fortune in that i was born in this generational that i had like i won [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5384.22s)]
*  the generational lottery is a way to say it my great grandparents on my mother's side were refugees [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5392.78s)]
*  from russia came to america in 1880 fleeing anti-semitism my father's father my grandfather [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5398.86s)]
*  and grandmother my grandfather flew uh fled from poland in 1920 also from anti-semitism they arrive [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5406.94s)]
*  at america and it's the american dream and it actually for my my on my mother's side it was [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5413.9s)]
*  the classic rags to riches because they had a rags business and they turned it into a paper company [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5421.0199999999995s)]
*  and so i was born in 1953 after the holocaust after world war ii and my parents were just so [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5427.66s)]
*  supportive and my dad was a doctor and i was told we want to help you do whatever you want to do [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5436.379999999999s)]
*  and i i felt like i was born at the height of american power american exceptionalism i was [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5444.78s)]
*  white i was male my family was well off i was the chosen people [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5451.5s)]
*  jewish american exceptionalism the only thing i wasn't was tall but i got every other sort of [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5458.94s)]
*  lottery thing and i just was raised that i could make a difference and so i had this sort of [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5464.86s)]
*  this um luxury there's actually a holocaust writer named primo levy who was one of my father's [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5472.38s)]
*  heroes in a way and and he wrote something very interesting that i think has relevance to where [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5481.18s)]
*  we're at today in in america and he talked about how we tend to think of that the revolutions [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5487.42s)]
*  for you know start with the oppressed and that the oppressed throw off their chains and they end up [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5495.5s)]
*  amassing all these people and they try to work for a better world he said but that's not actually [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5502.7s)]
*  what happens the revolutions don't begin with the oppressed because often that's the purpose of [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5507.5s)]
*  oppression is to make it so they can't do that they're so focused on survival he said the [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5513.26s)]
*  revolutions usually begin with the privileged who for one reason or another use their freedom [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5517.66s)]
*  use their privilege to argue to work towards a better life so what it means to me is that if [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5523.82s)]
*  you have this privilege you have the obligation and the opportunity to do things that other people [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5530.86s)]
*  cannot do it reminds me also of the hierarchy of needs many people have heard of abraham maslow's [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5538.38s)]
*  hierarchy of needs and the bottom one is survival that you have to work on core survival if if you [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5544.219999999999s)]
*  know we've had these um surveys that say a vast proportion of america cannot afford a 500 or [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5551.339999999999s)]
*  1000 unexpected expense so you're living at this edge of anxiety economic anxiety you can't really [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5559.1s)]
*  think about um many other ways to protest because you're focused on on survival so right so i felt [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5565.9800000000005s)]
*  that i was born into this privileged place and it took multiple generations from refugees from the [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5573.18s)]
*  american dream and so i felt i've had this um mission of this use the privilege for [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5579.9800000000005s)]
*  making it a better world so i've not been focused on making money i've not been focused on i've been [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5588.14s)]
*  focused on bringing these healing and spiritual potentials of psychedelics back to the world and [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5594.14s)]
*  one of the things that was so um reassuring to me and i think that people who will come to the [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5600.78s)]
*  psychedelic conference will see this is that once fda said no to mdma assisted therapy that they [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5608.3s)]
*  weren't ready to approve it that they wanted to see more data i was incredibly uh you know depressed [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5614.78s)]
*  and frustrated and all that but it took me a couple months to realize that this psychedelic [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5620.94s)]
*  renaissance that maps lycos could disappear but that there is so much going on with research into [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5625.42s)]
*  a whole range of different psychedelics that the field was moving forward regardless that something [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5633.66s)]
*  had been accomplished that this psychedelic renaissance was really moving forward and that [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5639.98s)]
*  that was this wave that i think is unstoppable that we're seeing the healing potentials in so [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5645.58s)]
*  many different ways with so many different drugs so that gave me this it was kind of reassuring [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5651.5s)]
*  yeah that that even though we were the first out of the gate and the fda wasn't ready [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5658.7s)]
*  things are moving forward in a great way so well you've got an amazing perspective considering [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5665.099999999999s)]
*  how much work it's been um the one of the things that you said that i think from the dream [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5669.42s)]
*  is to give people this understanding of interconnectedness that we are all connected [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5676.22s)]
*  and without that feeling war is a normal thing it's it's part of if you ask the average person [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5682.38s)]
*  could you conceive of a time in your lifetime where there's no war would you be willing to bet [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5690.22s)]
*  on that most people like no the world unfortunately i wish it was but unfortunately i think we're [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5694.14s)]
*  always going to have war that's if let's imagine a world where there was no restrictions on [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5699.5s)]
*  psychedelics because i'm of the belief that it's probably responsible for a lot of religious [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5708.46s)]
*  experiences that we've documented it's not it's not an uncommon theme in many many cultures that [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5714.78s)]
*  you have these psychedelic experiences and then through that these great revelations come and [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5725.259999999999s)]
*  then through that great change in in the culture i mean this is uh illucinian mysteries in ancient [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5731.66s)]
*  greece that brian murray rescue talks about so well these i without restrictions if we didn't [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5737.98s)]
*  have these fucking insane laws we would have progressed past where we are now if we didn't [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5745.58s)]
*  if we had gone from 1970 to 2025 without those restrictions in place who knows what this culture [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5752.379999999999s)]
*  looks like who knows what the world looks like and it's amazing that one administration one [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5760.299999999999s)]
*  presidential administration with one sweeping act that was essentially put in place to stop the [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5766.3s)]
*  civil rights movement and to stop the anti-war movement and to stop the black rights movement [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5771.5s)]
*  like if they had done that if that if they had not done that if that had not gone through [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5776.9400000000005s)]
*  we might be looking at a completely different world where we have culturally accelerated [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5783.26s)]
*  evolution that mirrors our electronically and technologically accelerated evolution [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5788.7s)]
*  i think that's exactly right yeah i think this um i'm smiling because um you you probably know [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5794.22s)]
*  this quote from john erlichman who was nixon's domestic policy advisor and this came out at the [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5801.26s)]
*  end of uh the 1970s he did an interview and he said that the two main enemies of the nixon [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5806.0599999999995s)]
*  white house were the civil rights movement and the hippies the anti-war movement and he said we [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5812.139999999999s)]
*  couldn't bust their we couldn't stop them from protesting but we could criminalize the drugs that [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5816.78s)]
*  they were using and use that to bust up their meetings arrest their leaders and he said did we [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5822.3s)]
*  know that we were exaggerating the risks of these drugs of course we did yeah and i think it's such [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5827.18s)]
*  a crime it's it's really a crime of enlightenment it's really it really is it is and when you talk [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5833.02s)]
*  about brian mirror rescue and the immortality key which by the way is being made into a documentary [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5841.66s)]
*  phenomenal book it's incorrect but the ellisonian mysteries is the longest running mystery ceremony [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5847.26s)]
*  that we know of in the history of the world roughly 2000 years it involved the psychedelic [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5852.46s)]
*  potion called kickian it's not exactly clear what was in it but it was wiped out in 396 by the [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5856.860000000001s)]
*  catholic church because psychedelics offer a direct experience of spirituality and often religious [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5863.740000000001s)]
*  systems want to be the intermediaries yeah exactly they want to be the gatekeepers and so there's [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5872.3s)]
*  so power when we think about the reintroduction of psychedelics you know we talk about what [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5877.900000000001s)]
*  happened in the controlled substance act in 1970 but it really goes all the way back to the [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5883.9800000000005s)]
*  destruction of the ellisonian mysteries and then we have a lot of the work in the middle ages where [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5889.1s)]
*  the women were mostly the plant medicine people and they have the burning of the witches when the [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5893.900000000001s)]
*  conquistadors started coming into western civilization here which was indigenous civilizations [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5898.62s)]
*  the first people that they tried to kill were the shamans that did the work with the mushrooms or [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5905.34s)]
*  the work with the peyote because they were the center of the communities now these communities [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5909.58s)]
*  were not all you know peace and love they were often warring and killing each other so there [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5914.46s)]
*  does need to be a lot more conscious evolution but there's a well they were living in a very [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5919.5s)]
*  different time yeah you know i mean you had a bunch of different languages you had tribal raiders [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5926.54s)]
*  it was very common there's you know it's just a different world they were living in a much more [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5932.22s)]
*  barbaric state yeah you know there was but it was essentially a window into prehistory yeah there's [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5939.34s)]
*  a book that i recommend for people by herman hess and it's called the glass bead game magister ludi [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5946.14s)]
*  the glass bead game and it helped terminus win the noble prize for literature and he wrote it [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5953.58s)]
*  during world war two and so there is these competitive energies that we have that often [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5958.14s)]
*  can lead to war but the book was a post-apocalyptic culture that had decided to harness these [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5963.5s)]
*  competitive energies into what they called the glass bead game which was this it's a beautiful [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5971.58s)]
*  book but the glass bead game was about a competition using poetry mathematics music [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5977.58s)]
*  and philosophy to try to describe the universe and they would have this different kind of [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5985.26s)]
*  who would be the most eloquent and the most comprehensive and this was kind of the the [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5992.54s)]
*  antidote to the competitiveness that led to this apocalypse and and he's writing this during world [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=5998.46s)]
*  war two as well as this sort of idealistic hopeful thing but but the other part of the book was that [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6005.42s)]
*  this game itself becomes a little bit too abstract and it no longer harnesses the passions of the [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6011.26s)]
*  common people it became more of this elite and the head of it the magister ludi decides that he has [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6018.54s)]
*  to leave so that there has to be some way that we we do compete with each other but we have to do it [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6024.9400000000005s)]
*  in a way to learn non-violence and our tools of technology are getting ever more destructive [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6032.46s)]
*  the nuclear proliferation is taking more so i ended my ted talk with this which was 2019 and [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6039.02s)]
*  interestingly enough it took six years until nolan williams gave a talk on the main stage of ted [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6045.9800000000005s)]
*  about ipogaine so it took six years from my first that was the only ever ted talk on [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6052.46s)]
*  psychedelics in 2019 and then nolan williams talked about i began just recently and he'll also [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6058.22s)]
*  be at the psychedelic conference but this idea i ended up saying it's a race between [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6062.7s)]
*  consciousness and catastrophe and catastrophe is very common i mean as you just talked about [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6068.7s)]
*  coming back from ukraine um today i don't know what's happening right now but today india and [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6077.02s)]
*  pakistan started bombing each other yeah yeah it's just terrifying two nuclear powers are [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6081.74s)]
*  sending missiles into each other's country yeah um you know what's going on with israel and [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6088.62s)]
*  palestine i just want to mention something so there are small groups of israelis and [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6094.0599999999995s)]
*  palestinians that are doing ayahuasca and mdma together so that in a way to to emphasize their [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6099.74s)]
*  common humanity but also to work through their traumas and one of the most um i think um [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6106.38s)]
*  inspiring and motivating groups in israel and palestine is a group called combatants for peace [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6114.54s)]
*  and so these are israeli soldiers or what would be called palestinian terrorists or those that had [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6121.900000000001s)]
*  used violence on both sides and they've given up violence for non-violence so it's a group called [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6128.78s)]
*  combatants for peace and the palestinian is uh has been invited to come speak at psychedelic [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6133.98s)]
*  science and he was denied a visa wow he cannot come to our conference we're trying to see if we [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6141.58s)]
*  can work behind the scenes i don't know if we can to get him a visa but that this idea that we're [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6148.0599999999995s)]
*  he's just because he's palestinian i i don't know the exact reasons why he did have a violent past [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6154.86s)]
*  because that is the whole point of combatants for peace they were combatants they're now [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6160.94s)]
*  leading this non-violent approach to work together so there's a incredible neuroscientist israeli [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6167.0199999999995s)]
*  neuroscientist leo roseman at exeter university in england that's done work with israelis and [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6174.379999999999s)]
*  palestinians and he's brought a bunch of them to to spain for an ayahuasca session and with different [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6179.82s)]
*  measures of how you see the other and once you do see this commonality you you don't see the other [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6185.42s)]
*  as so foreign from yourself and you can recognize their pain um and so like a residual effect of [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6191.26s)]
*  tribal culture from the ancient times that this you had to other these people in order to commit [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6199.5s)]
*  horrific crimes because they were going to commit horrific crimes on you yeah you had to protect the [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6206.22s)]
*  people around you and unfortunately that's baked into our genes you reminded me of one of the more [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6210.46s)]
*  powerful for me statements adam kinsnicker who's the republican on the january 6 committee from [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6218.46s)]
*  in the house to look at what happened on january 6 he said that he's learned from his investigations [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6224.14s)]
*  that there's something that people are more scared of than death and that's being kicked out of your [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6230.3s)]
*  tribe that were such social beings that this idea that we would be isolated and alone that that's [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6235.82s)]
*  how you have a lot of these fundamentalist religions that keep people within them because [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6244.46s)]
*  if you deviate you get kicked out of the tribe and they of course they ostracize you yeah so we're [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6252.0599999999995s)]
*  so cultural things that mimic religions in that way yeah yeah and then you have the fundamentalists [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6257.179999999999s)]
*  of all the religions i think this is very true that the fundamentalists of the different religions [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6263.34s)]
*  are closer to each other than they are to the mystics of their own religions and the mystics [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6268.7s)]
*  of the religions are closer to the people who are other religions because they see that it's all this [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6273.58s)]
*  common reality but that we have different symbols different stories that we tell [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6278.46s)]
*  but that but it's all about this combination of us being both interconnected and also [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6283.34s)]
*  extremely individual i think this other part is that the more you realize [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6290.7s)]
*  how we're all essentially more similar i mean look at our dna is very similar to some animal dna it's [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6294.7s)]
*  is there's very slight differences we we are and then when you talk about humans so different skin [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6301.42s)]
*  color different things our commonalities are really more but once you can kind of understand that [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6307.5s)]
*  hopefully then you can be more willing to appreciate the differences so it's this [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6315.02s)]
*  paradoxical thing where that the more you realize we're interconnected the more you can appreciate [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6320.38s)]
*  the unique individuality of every person yeah i think what you brought up about the suspension [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6325.18s)]
*  of the illucidian mysteries the the that's just so important that that that kind of tactic [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6333.820000000001s)]
*  has always existed because the psychotic people in power want to maintain their control over the [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6340.54s)]
*  population and it's very difficult to do it's very difficult to get people to fight each other when [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6346.139999999999s)]
*  they're all tripping together yeah and they're like oh there's something more to this like we're [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6351.26s)]
*  missing out on a giant piece of this puzzle and it's like there's these tools that are available [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6355.179999999999s)]
*  to humanity that can elevate us and yet these tools are by tyrants are being kept from people [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6360.78s)]
*  not just kept from people but as you're talking about with nixon's advisor yeah openly discussed [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6369.42s)]
*  how they lied and used propaganda to pretend that the effects were far worse than they really were [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6374.78s)]
*  yeah yeah and i think that uh it's again really important to say that the tools are in some ways [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6379.66s)]
*  less important than the context within which they're used so the social context so for example [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6387.9s)]
*  um religions often cozy up to the people in power so there's a an ayahuasca church the uniao de [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6394.860000000001s)]
*  vegetal and they came from brazil they actually went to the u.s supreme court and got approval for [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6402.54s)]
*  practicing ayahuasca in the united states but they're a syncretic religion meaning that in [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6408.7s)]
*  order for them to survive they had to merge with the church so they they've become a patriarchal [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6413.58s)]
*  homophobic hierarchical and some of the leaders of the uniao de vegetal aligned with bolsonaro [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6420.62s)]
*  who was about destroying the amazon so that it doesn't the tools themselves don't automatically [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6426.7s)]
*  make you a better person it's the context so it's the same way in therapy that you can have these [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6432.78s)]
*  experiences but it's the context in which you interpret them and then it's the integration [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6439.82s)]
*  work that you do after that really makes the most sense so that um you can have psychedelic [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6446.14s)]
*  experiences but if it's not in this um sort of therapeutic context where you're really open to [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6452.14s)]
*  to deal with the different um issues and things fears of death things that come up [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6459.1s)]
*  so i think we need to make that clear that it's not just it's a magic pill and it will [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6464.38s)]
*  produce better people a great example that is the berserkers yeah the vikings took mushrooms before [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6469.5s)]
*  they killed everybody yes yes yes yes it doesn't always make you a better person really and again [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6474.86s)]
*  context of the culture and the times a barbaric time you know yeah have we talked about mckenna's [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6482.7s)]
*  stone dape theory before um no we haven't what do you what is your perspective on that idea [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6488.0599999999995s)]
*  well um what he's basically saying is that um it's a real good chance that um early um monkeys and [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6493.82s)]
*  stuff um would experiment with whatever they could around them to eat and that they would [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6503.98s)]
*  eat mushrooms and that mushrooms then elevated their consciousness started helping develop language [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6509.259999999999s)]
*  i think it's plausible i mean i don't know that we'll know for sure have you heard denis describe [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6516.86s)]
*  it denis i think doesn't even better job of describing it than terrence because denis is [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6521.74s)]
*  like a legitimate hardcore scientist yes yes and he explains how psilocybin would interact with [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6526.86s)]
*  the brain and glossolalia and all these different effects that could come out of it and then that [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6532.46s)]
*  psilocybin is known for helping regrow neural tissue yes right that's what i talked about this [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6538.38s)]
*  neuroplasticity right and this um yeah that gul dullins talking about these opening these [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6544.06s)]
*  critical periods yes because part of the theory is taking into consideration the doubling of the [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6548.7s)]
*  human brain size over a period of two million years that is this very extraordinary development [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6554.54s)]
*  and uh you know many biologists called the biggest mystery in the entire fossil record like what [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6559.660000000001s)]
*  happened and mckenna's perspective was i think i know i think and it makes sense because he had [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6565.1s)]
*  it also he applied what we know about the climate back then the climate was changing and that these [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6571.1s)]
*  rainforests were receding into grasslands which would make a lot more undulates undulates were [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6577.900000000001s)]
*  pooping everywhere mushrooms growing cow poop bam bam bam and you got all these pieces together [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6584.0599999999995s)]
*  and then the fact that it would increase visual acuity and low doses and make people more or [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6589.66s)]
*  you know pre-human hominids more amorous they make them more likely to mate uh make them better [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6595.9s)]
*  hunters because it includes it improves their vision also make them more creative so they're [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6601.82s)]
*  probably develop new new ways to hunt and fish so they would survive more they have more resources [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6606.7s)]
*  more food more protein they grow bigger and stronger and then the brains are developing [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6612.54s)]
*  because they're eating these mushrooms and i i think there's a that's plausible but i think then [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6616.46s)]
*  what does that mean for us today is that i do think that the psychedelic experiences could be [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6622.78s)]
*  part of this next sort of evolution of humanity to make us more collaborative and peaceful to deal [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6628.3s)]
*  with the incredible technologies that we're developing yeah that we um einstein had this [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6635.5s)]
*  great quote um he said the splitting of the atom has changed uh everything except our mode of [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6640.62s)]
*  thinking and hence we are drifting towards unparalleled catastrophe what shall be required [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6648.22s)]
*  if mankind is to survive is a whole new mode of thinking and what is that new mode of thinking [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6652.62s)]
*  is sort of how we're interconnected it's yeah it's what the astronauts have said so i think we [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6658.0599999999995s)]
*  should say that this doesn't depend on psychedelics the astronauts who've been up in space look back [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6663.099999999999s)]
*  and see the earth as a whole thing well that's got to be a psychedelic experience just seeing [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6668.06s)]
*  earth from the stars and well not from the stars but you know from space looking down [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6672.9400000000005s)]
*  and seeing like this the nonsense of these imaginary lines that we put on the ground [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6677.900000000001s)]
*  yeah you don't see the borders you don't see the religions you just see that this is one [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6684.14s)]
*  really unique planet yeah that we've all grown up from and it's produced all this [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6689.18s)]
*  life and we're all interconnected but then there's this thought process that the the conflict and the [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6695.5s)]
*  evil is important to sort of strengthen and encourage the good and that this is all a part [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6701.26s)]
*  of this evolutionary process that the human race is going through and that almost the in the face [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6707.18s)]
*  of this catastrophe is where real change comes and then we kind of have to understand that evil [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6713.26s)]
*  and terrible behavior is a real thing and what would it what are and and have some mad search [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6718.94s)]
*  for the tools to mitigate these problems and so it encourages encourages people like yourself [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6726.219999999999s)]
*  it encourages people to try to figure these things out using these and again these tools [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6731.58s)]
*  which are right under our nose that have been here for thousands of years yeah i mean people [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6737.5s)]
*  say that the stars burn brighter because they're surrounded by darkness yeah yeah that's the weird [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6741.5s)]
*  thing about the human race it's like it seems like that has to be there you have to get rained on to [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6748.86s)]
*  appreciate a sunny day well there's an incredible quote from carl jung so this union psychology [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6753.74s)]
*  and what he said was that we need to study more about humanity we need to study how we operate [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6759.98s)]
*  he said because the only real danger that exists is man himself that we are able to deal with all [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6768.86s)]
*  these things we said we we know virtually nothing about man we must do more study because we are the [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6775.34s)]
*  source of all coming evil yikes this was in 1959 about three years before he died and it's chilling [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6781.900000000001s)]
*  we are the source of all coming evil well also that's in the shadow of the bomb right like [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6790.62s)]
*  everybody was still freaking out like what did we do you know we just annihilated two cities yeah now [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6795.82s)]
*  let's talk about the shadow something else so in union psychology the shadow is the parts of ourselves [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6802.62s)]
*  that we disown you know it's it's our dark sides that we don't see and so what young said is that [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6807.82s)]
*  the most political therapeutic and social thing that we can do is to withdraw the projection of [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6814.46s)]
*  our shadow onto others so when you cannot deal with a part of yourself you project it out and [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6820.3s)]
*  so these people become the enemies these people become the evil and we're the all good [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6826.7s)]
*  um it reminds me actually i was with terence um this was my first um dmt experience so this is [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6831.820000000001s)]
*  about 40 years ago this was at esalen at big sir it was with ralph metzner uh terence mckenna and a [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6840.14s)]
*  bunch of us were um trying to gather together to think how to protect mdma and one evening um we [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6846.620000000001s)]
*  all were trying dmt so not five mato dmt but dmt and you smoke it in a pipe it's like 10 or 15 [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6854.86s)]
*  minutes and um and then you just go out and then you you come back and share what happened and then [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6862.54s)]
*  you pass the pipe to the next person so it's like a three four hour process with this group and so [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6869.179999999999s)]
*  for me my first experience with dmt was very so the first thing i saw was this horizontal line [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6874.38s)]
*  and then i saw a vertical line and then it turned red and then it turned into cubes and then it [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6881.900000000001s)]
*  turned into like an mc escher painting where the space doesn't seem to make sense anymore and then [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6886.54s)]
*  i was blasted into this other universe or not but i was blasted out of myself into the universe [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6890.9400000000005s)]
*  and i felt like i was part of everything and everything was part of me and it was this glorious [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6897.66s)]
*  billions of years of evolution and i went through all of this but then after all that finally i had [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6901.900000000001s)]
*  this idea that if i'm part of everything and everything part of me then hitler is part of me too [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6907.1s)]
*  and it was shattering and but it was true i can't you can't claim to be part of everything and only [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6915.820000000001s)]
*  take the good parts right and it just was a shocker to me that this logic brought me to this and it [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6923.42s)]
*  was really really shattering and it took me this whole day to start working on that and then the [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6931.1s)]
*  very next day and this gets back a little bit to legalization the next day and to maps's [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6938.3s)]
*  political strategy the next day we experimented with ketamine all right so in my ketamine experience [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6944.9400000000005s)]
*  somehow or other i was above and behind hitler because you know the the holocaust had been this [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6952.38s)]
*  animating idea for me in my whole life so i'm above and behind hitler ketamine gives you a bit [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6958.06s)]
*  of remove like you're not quite there so i felt that i was safe but i was watching him give a [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6964.06s)]
*  speech like to these rallies where you have you know enormous numbers of germans and i was thinking [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6969.26s)]
*  how do i get into his head so he doesn't want to murder everybody doesn't want to kill the jews [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6975.18s)]
*  doesn't want to have this war how do i get into his head and i felt this panic rising [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6979.26s)]
*  and it was like bubbles like i was underwater and i felt that the bubbles of my fear if they broke [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6985.18s)]
*  the surface i wouldn't be able to i'd have to look away i couldn't deal with it and then i realized [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6991.26s)]
*  that one of the beauties of ketamine is that it doesn't interfere with your respiration you can [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=6996.46s)]
*  breathe so i started breathing deeply which is a really important way to kind of ground yourself [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7000.7s)]
*  in difficult experiences of all kinds psychedelics or not so i started really breathing and then i was [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7006.06s)]
*  able to go back and watch and what i saw was this heil hitler salute and then i saw everybody doing [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7013.18s)]
*  it back to him and and i got this sense because hitler was able to help people feel that they were [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7020.06s)]
*  all together the german nation that they were all part of something bigger and so it felt like he's [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7024.9400000000005s)]
*  pushing this energy out with the heil hitler salute and then everybody is pushing it back to him so it [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7030.620000000001s)]
*  felt like the one to the many and the many to the one and then it was like vibrations going up and [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7036.620000000001s)]
*  up and up like this kind of unity between him and the people and it just was terrifying and then i [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7042.06s)]
*  realized that there's no way i can get into his head like you're saying the psychopaths that are [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7049.26s)]
*  often politicians that there's they're getting so much out of it but it's the people giving away [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7053.660000000001s)]
*  their power that i thought that's where the solution has to be so maps is about mass mental [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7058.54s)]
*  health about a spiritualized humanity and so that led to this understanding for me that [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7065.02s)]
*  that safety for humanity is not just giving drugs to the leaders and having them wake up [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7073.900000000001s)]
*  you know it's about anchoring mass mental health and that the people that are giving away their [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7079.9800000000005s)]
*  power are getting less from it than the people that are amassing all this power [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7085.5s)]
*  so that led to this idea we need to medicalize we need to [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7089.66s)]
*  go you know to produce real scientific evidence about benefits and risks but at the same time [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7094.78s)]
*  there needs to be drug policy reform where we need access to people in a way preventative medicine [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7099.9s)]
*  or if they don't have a diagnosis so that it's this two parallel paths one is science and medicine [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7106.3s)]
*  the other is drug policy reform and then we talked about earlier about educating young people we need [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7112.54s)]
*  honest drug education people have died from taking ecstasy contaminated with fentanyl [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7117.82s)]
*  you know we need pure drugs we need pure support treatment on demand but i think the drug war is so [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7124.219999999999s)]
*  counterproductive that if we could just turn a switch it would be worth it yeah but we need [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7131.42s)]
*  to really anchor and build kind of a healthier culture and healthier people but it has to be a [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7136.7s)]
*  sort of masses rather than just individuals have you read blitzed by norman oler i have not we have [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7143.5s)]
*  it right over there right don't we have it over there is in the other room uh phenomenal book on [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7149.9s)]
*  the drug use by the nazis oh it's all about meth yeah they were all methed out of their fucking [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7155.66s)]
*  minds which is like the wrong drugs can ruin everything you know and that whole experience [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7160.86s)]
*  of being a part of something and everyone's on amphetamines yeah i mean what the fuck they were [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7168.62s)]
*  giving them out to the soldiers that's how they got them to go through poland in three days it's [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7174.46s)]
*  a phenomenal book like but just like crazy when you think about how history was changed and a [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7178.54s)]
*  large part of the way it was accepted was because everybody was met up just yeah on the wrong i mean [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7185.5s)]
*  imagine if hitler was dosing out everybody with mushrooms they would have been like hold on like [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7192.94s)]
*  why are we in poland what the fuck are we doing i'm not killing anybody what is this this is crazy [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7198.78s)]
*  i gotta get out of this country like people just abandon ship it's just the worst drugs are the [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7204.22s)]
*  ones that are always pushed by the tyrants and i think blitzed is a perfect example of that the [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7211.9s)]
*  nazi administration what the the nazi government was doing giving their soldiers giving their [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7217.58s)]
*  people in the tanks got the most meth because they had to be at the front lines it's a crazy [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7225.580000000001s)]
*  book man it just makes you think like what does that look like if no meth is there does this all [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7230.540000000001s)]
*  get worked out way in advance does this never happen does the holocaust never take place like [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7235.42s)]
*  what was what would have been like with no meth yeah and it promotes aggression as well oh yeah [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7240.860000000001s)]
*  yeah i mean they went through poland in three days with no sleep yeah just killing everybody and then [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7248.38s)]
*  these french soldiers are all drinking they had they they were given like a liter of wine every [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7253.660000000001s)]
*  day and they you know so they they're drunk and silly and then the messed up nazis show up and [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7258.620000000001s)]
*  like what the fuck well and you talked about the berserkers yeah yeah yeah yeah but that's the [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7264.38s)]
*  crazy thing is that berserkers were taking mushrooms right do you think you were taking [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7270.22s)]
*  amanita and the difference did they also take psilocybin sometimes um probably i'm not sure [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7273.820000000001s)]
*  yeah i think that was a part of the nazi lore oh excuse me the viking lore as well [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7280.54s)]
*  the viking lore had did vikings take find out out would they just take because amanita is a weird [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7285.58s)]
*  one right i remember mckenna saying something about that he believes that it differed not just [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7290.78s)]
*  seasonally but he thinks the effects differ differed genetically and geographically and [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7297.42s)]
*  they were different in different places sort of like you know like a bad example but all i have [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7303.26s)]
*  like if you grow certain tobaccos in cuba they make the best cigars because the soil is like so [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7309.1s)]
*  rich and you get a cigar from you know it's grown somewhere in america it's not going to taste like [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7315.34s)]
*  a cigar that's grown in cuba because there's something going on with the difference and [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7320.700000000001s)]
*  i would imagine is probably something about the nutrients in certain soil that would lead to the [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7325.18s)]
*  amanita developing these properties in some places and not in others yeah amanita muscaria [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7330.9400000000005s)]
*  no definitive evidence of specific mushrooms vikings regularly consumed that some scholars [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7338.14s)]
*  propose they may have used mushrooms for hallucinogenic purposes most cited examples fly [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7343.02s)]
*  argaric agaric mushroom amanita muscaria some believe may have been the vedic soma a sacred [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7348.38s)]
*  drink described in ancient text also speculation about other hallucinogenic compounds like psilocybe [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7355.820000000001s)]
*  cubensis psilocybin mushrooms being used so they might have yeah as well the amanita muscaria is the [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7361.26s)]
*  weird one though right yeah actually in ukraine they they've had some people have developed [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7366.94s)]
*  amanita and taken out some of the more toxins and in low doses they use it for sleep oh wow [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7373.099999999999s)]
*  amazing also i've just been in touch with some very well politically connected scientists in india [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7379.259999999999s)]
*  and they don't think that amanita is actually soma what do they think so they don't know they [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7386.86s)]
*  why do they not think it was amanita then because of the experiences that they've been [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7392.54s)]
*  to sort of track the way they describe it and the way people have described it before well there's [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7397.9s)]
*  probably a bunch of undiscovered psychedelics right like from the past at least it very well [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7403.9s)]
*  could be well we don't even actually know what was in the uh kick-in from the elusus we we think that [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7410.219999999999s)]
*  it might have something to do with ergot and lsd like article about it actually from netflix about [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7416.299999999999s)]
*  the show vikings talks about how the amanita might have not actually made them berserkers [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7423.5s)]
*  and it was something else doing it hmm well it says if anything fly agaric would have made them [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7428.22s)]
*  particularly worthless warriors since the side effects included drowsiness vomiting muscle [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7435.34s)]
*  spasms and numbness in arms and legs rather it's more like berserkers were getting high off [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7440.14s)]
*  henbane what is henbane is actually it was used in the middle ages by a lot of the witches it's [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7446.22s)]
*  it's very i think it's like um important herb for viking and druid rituals connected to witchcraft [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7454.22s)]
*  whoa black henbite shade yeah interesting night shade i thought that was a poison [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7459.82s)]
*  it can be in doses yeah interesting so the the aminita mascaria one though [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7467.74s)]
*  i always go back to the sacred mushroom in the cross because that was what john marco allegro [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7474.86s)]
*  believed was the early days of christianity they were consuming that yeah but it's isn't a strange [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7479.0199999999995s)]
*  one that you don't hear about people having like these breakthrough experiences on amanita no you [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7485.58s)]
*  don't you don't and and you saw one of the side effects was drowsiness right that sort of relates [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7491.0199999999995s)]
*  to what they've done with low doses of amanita for sleep yeah makes sense it's just i've always [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7495.339999999999s)]
*  been puzzled by that one because it does appear in so many shamanic rituals it appears in the old [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7501.42s)]
*  depictions of christmas and santa claus and you know all the christmas used to have like little [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7507.9s)]
*  elves and the the amanita i always wonder like was the amanita different back then you know [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7512.7s)]
*  like what was going on like what happened um i don't know how you find that out i mean you can [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7518.7s)]
*  probably do some genetic studies to see how long these genes that are in amanita have persisted and [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7526.3s)]
*  yeah i'm not sure i mean but it's pretty clear that at least from a lot of these indian scholars [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7535.34s)]
*  that that amanita is not soma but they don't know what it is interesting interesting yeah the ergott [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7539.9800000000005s)]
*  thing is very interesting right because ergott has similar effects to lsd yeah and so the [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7546.22s)]
*  illucinian mysteries they i think it's only right now it's been confirmed from i think it was just [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7551.98s)]
*  one or two vessels these pottery vessels that they found traces of ergott yeah i mean that's [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7557.58s)]
*  unbelievable the the again this just illustrates how far advanced our science has become way over [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7563.26s)]
*  our spiritual and emotional development you're able to look at thousands of year old vessels and [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7568.86s)]
*  get microscopic traces of what was in them crazy yeah well at least it lets you know okay now it [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7573.1s)]
*  makes sense that that's how they figured out democracy well the greeks are the yeah yeah the [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7581.9800000000005s)]
*  the home of uh democracy i mean and also like just this astounding culture that emerged [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7588.3s)]
*  and how much of it was connected to that and then the people in power were like yeah we're [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7595.660000000001s)]
*  going to shut that down we don't like this aspect of your you guys are a little too hard to control [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7600.7s)]
*  a little too hard to propagandize you don't need the intermediaries and we want the taxes we want [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7606.3s)]
*  to tell you what and and so i think when we this gets back to one of the earlier points you made [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7612.86s)]
*  about it do i get frustrated which is to realize that um this is actually thousands of years plus [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7618.78s)]
*  of the suppression of psychedelics and also you said something earlier how quick 100 years goes by [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7626.62s)]
*  yeah so what if something takes a couple generations that's okay you know i think one of the things i [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7631.82s)]
*  like to say is that if your goals are something that you can accomplish in your own lifetime [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7638.14s)]
*  they're too small we need to have like multi-generational goals um i grew up um [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7642.7s)]
*  outside of chicago and there's this uh bahai temple so the bahai religion is um emerged out [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7649.74s)]
*  of islam but it's more of a universal religion and this um and they're suppressed a lot in the [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7655.98s)]
*  islamic countries but there was this temple that they built outside of chicago this beautiful temple [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7662.86s)]
*  but it took three generations to build it and when you're a little kid and thinking about it i'm like [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7668.459999999999s)]
*  how could they even plan ahead how could they even have hope that why would they even start something [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7673.74s)]
*  that they didn't even know would ever be finished right but that now it's one of the most beautiful [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7678.379999999999s)]
*  temples in the world and so i think this process of elevating consciousness in humanity so we can [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7683.18s)]
*  learn how to live together and not destroy the planet is um however long it happens to take [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7690.46s)]
*  so if things take longer than i thought you know does a great attitude yeah well i think you have [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7696.38s)]
*  to have that attitude but you're always so happy every time i meet you you're always smiling you're [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7702.860000000001s)]

*  we had that fda would approve well they they didn't so you know do you just give up no you know you [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7720.14s)]

*  because again for me what i'm even though maps has been focused on mdma what it's really about [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7801.820000000001s)]
*  is the psychedelic renaissance so i don't see the psilocybin or the ibogaine or anything as [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7807.900000000001s)]
*  competition it's we want the psychedelic therapists of the future to be cross-trained in all the [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7813.660000000001s)]
*  different drugs and then to be able to customize the treatment for each in each person and that's [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7818.86s)]
*  what we're hoping to to develop and one more time what are the dates and where is this uh it's june [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7825.98s)]
*  16th to the 20th it's coming up next month and it's in denver it's at the colorado convention center [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7830.78s)]

*  whoa it was astonishing it was um yeah must have been the nicest people too oh it was so hopeful [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7844.78s)]
*  and it was magical um so um i think that this would be um if anybody wants to learn about the [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7851.82s)]
*  psychedelic community this is where we gather together this is where how many feds do you think [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7858.62s)]
*  go to these things well we want them to come that's the point is that we want them to come [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7862.7s)]
*  well here's the other point is that we we work with police officers the when you think about [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7867.9s)]
*  what job is among the most traumatizing and it's being a police yes or being a um emt emt or or [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7874.06s)]
*  being a prison guard yep or these and and they're trained sort of to suppress their feelings to not [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7881.900000000001s)]
*  talk about it right and so there's so yeah we want the feds to come the more that they come the more [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7888.860000000001s)]

*  even got permission from their police chiefs to go through our protocol to get mdma as part of their [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7901.26s)]
*  training wow so really it's uh healing for all that's why i'm going to beirut that's why [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7905.42s)]

*  years or whatever we will eventually fda will eventually approve mdma assisted therapy for ptsd [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7923.900000000001s)]
*  then they'll approve psilocybin and other things and so i'm sort of going around the world in sort [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7930.14s)]
*  of high trauma low resource areas to try to globalize access um and and i think that we're in a [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7935.1s)]
*  perilous time in america right now and we could use more people dealing with their fears dealing [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7942.54s)]
*  with their anxiety withdrawing the projection of the shadows you know immigrants have actually [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llgBlytRttc&t=7947.900000000001s)]
