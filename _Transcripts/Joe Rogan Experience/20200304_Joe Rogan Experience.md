# Joe Rogan Experience #1436 - Adam Curry
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 04, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaPKrZTUoUs)
*  We we spark one up on the New Year's Eve. We put filled up that hole. Oh the actual
*  Oh my god rolling paper that came with Big Bamboo. That was the first time I really went out where we're live right now
*  So just let everybody know we're talking about Cheech and Chong's album Big Bamboo. It actually came with a real rolling paper
*  Yeah, huge just across the I think was across the double the the double album. Dude. You have a flip phone. I do
*  I do I do I do I do stepped out
*  OTG brother. Yeah, you figured it out
*  Create less data. Yeah, that's that's my mom. Is that what it is? Yeah. Well two things one
*  Your phone is always fucking with you
*  It's yeah, it's notifying and you know, yeah, and I just didn't want to be a part of that anymore
*  I wanted to you know be a little more connected to life outside. You still call people
*  Well, this is so this is actually a new flip phone from
*  T-Mobile Alcatel and it it has Kai OS which is so it's not really a trackable OS
*  Although Google put in a serious about this. I'm very serious about yeah. Oh, yeah, and you know, so all the apps are all
*  They're all tracking you they're all doing all kinds of shit
*  But initially really just to not be you know a slave to this thing. Yeah
*  And the further I got into it the more I liked it
*  And you don't really need it now
*  I have a device with me that's off this works as a hotspot so I can turn into a hotspot if I really really
*  Really needed to do something. But what do you need right text phone call, right?
*  And if there's something that I really need to look up you just turn around and say hey can someone Google this for me?
*  They do it. There's always someone around are you texting on that thing? Yeah. Yeah duty nine. Is that what you're doing?
*  They have a it's like a t9. It's a little bit better. It's their version of predictive texting
*  Yeah
*  I really am serious about it. Well, you should be yeah, everyone should be yeah the problem
*  I mean we have all this cool shit all this great technology, but the business model fucked us all I mean
*  Six years ago. I had the first Amazon echo like this is groundbreaking
*  Dvorak my co-host he was laughing at me. He's like, why would you bring a spy device into your house?
*  It look I'm just testing this out if it had an Apple logo on it
*  Everyone would be losing their shit right now, but it didn't and I loved it
*  hooked it up to the light and all that stuff going and then as I started to understand what it was really doing and what it's
*  Really communicating all these things right down to like your Roku remote you pick that up. It's communicating with homebase
*  So all this stuff I got rid of all of it. Well, just got rid of it
*  um, you know, I was listening to one of Sam Harris's podcast and
*  He was talking with someone that said and they had a really good great quote that we didn't realize that our data
*  Was something valuable, right?
*  We didn't realize it was a commodity and it was being sold not just a commodity that's kind of value but insanely
*  Extremely. Yeah, that's what where Facebook makes all their money. That's where Google makes all their money everybody
*  Yeah, everybody make it from your data and you never really understood what you were doing when you signed off to give that data away
*  When you sign the terms of agreements and you're like, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, whatever and nobody breeds through that shit
*  You know, what's even more egregious is there's a company called plaid PLA ID. Yes just sold the visa for I think
*  four or five billion dollars and
*  it's the
*  The financial back end or kind of like a bridge between all these apps that can do stuff with your bank account and your bank account
*  so instead of so if you have an app like Venmo or
*  Shit, I you know name any payment cash app. I didn't want to disparage anyone who might be advertising
*  Cash app PayPal
*  Well, PayPal do it PayPal has their own system
*  But what you do is you sign up and you literally give this app your
*  Username and log into your bank account instead of an API or some kind of programming interface
*  Just lets the app talk to your bank account and put money in take it out
*  It can do anything it in fact, it is just like screams screen scraping. It's going it can go through
*  anything that's connected to your bank account it can look at and they do and
*  And credit karma another great a great example of it and they are just sucking out all of your information
*  When you pay your bills who you pay first why you know if you have you know what your pattern is of?
*  Credit card payment moving stuff around so you think you're just using it as a as a utility
*  But they're tracking your fucking life
*  Dude, you're really concerned about this
*  Everybody will get the world they deserve, you know, so I'm trying to protect myself and people I love also
*  You know the drone can't target me that easily with this protecting you Joe. Thank you
*  It seems somewhat inevitable right that this connection that we have to technology gets deeper and deeper into our lives
*  But that what what disturbs me is that there's these giant corporations that are not just profiting off of our connection
*  But then they're using that money and that influence to affect a lot of things in our culture
*  Well, they're enslaving you. Yeah, so credit karma is a great example
*  Which also just sold for seven billion dollars
*  It was literally
*  Changing your behavior to get a higher credit score and this credit score isn't really even an official credit score
*  It's the one that they kind of made up
*  So they'll say pay your utilities on time then we'll raise your credit score your credit score is higher now
*  We can lend you this money. You see so they're training people to do certain things like
*  the progressive app for insurance
*  It's training you to drive in a quote-unquote responsible manner because you get discounts if you you know
*  Don't break too hard if you're not accelerating if you're not breaking speed limits, etc
*  Is it hooked up to the GPS? Oh, yeah, so it knows your speeds and everything. It's monitoring everything
*  You're breaking velocity all of that shit. Oh, yeah
*  So they take that into consideration every month when the whole point and the point is to train the user to be a good
*  Fiscally good person and you'll do that just because you want to save some money
*  Well, of course, everyone does that and you're gonna be you're gonna be forced into it. Like I just got
*  Health insurance new health insurance and they're oh download the app
*  And if you download the app will give you a break why because they're going to tell me to do things
*  This app is saying, you know now it's small things, but it'll start telling you stand up
*  You know move around and if you'd follow it if you follow it, then you'll get a discount
*  So we're really really becoming enslaved that way. That's a that is definitely a way to look at it
*  That's the business model. Yeah, and it gets more and more immersive
*  Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah
*  Yeah, I didn't know the progressives app does that that's all of them do Joe all of the insurance company. Yeah, yeah, yeah that makes sense
*  I mean that's that would be the best way to figure out if you're actually a good driver
*  Or if you're just some dick it'll gets lucky
*  well
*  Yeah, I mean that's kind of the the marketing is like, you know, if you're a good guy, don't worry about it
*  But they keep pushing they keep pushing
*  You know, they'll just keep telling you and you don't have to have the app active for that to be tracked or monitored
*  That was one of the grossest arguments I heard after the whole Snowden thing like what do you care if you're not breaking the law?
*  That's changing a little bit
*  I have a 29 year old daughter and she definitely had that that mindset and her friends did it's changing
*  You know now it's like okay, we totally get it. They're tracking all of our shit
*  So we're gonna might not use this or we'll leave the phone at home
*  There's a little bit of that creeping in but in general it's like crack, you know, how can you do with it's not easy
*  It's I mean this this phone it's sometimes like I could but no
*  It's like and I just have to stand back and go do I really need to have this information right at this very moment
*  Do I really need to do this? No, typically no. Yeah when I feel any sort of anxiety or boredom
*  I just grab the phone. It's just instantly my little my little soothing blanket or my little teething thing
*  Absolutely
*  And I play a game with myself
*  You know
*  I'll give myself points as I'm driving around like person walking on the street holding the phone in the hand one point
*  You don't need to actually hold the phone in your hand and women
*  Holy crap. They got two phones sometimes with a little, you know, a little button plug so it doesn't fall off
*  They got their bag
*  Maybe they got the kid or a stroller and so pop up on the doing all and just they're all over the place all the time
*  So it's one point for just holding it too if you're walking and doing something I see a lot of that
*  How many points if you have a kid and you're walking and looking at your phone that seems like that'd be a bonus
*  It's the best if you're in the car ten points
*  If you're walking with your kid on the phone, it's five points and you can hit a hundred within five minutes. It's it's crazy
*  It's zombies. Yeah, we start to really pay attention to it when you're above people have a truck and I want to look down
*  My truck you can see people texting and it's stunning. Yeah, how many people are on the highway texting at the same time?
*  I got rear-ended
*  with my truck say
*  Maybe two months ago in Austin, you know right after a stoplight and I was in the left-hand lane
*  I was gonna turn left BAM full speed. It was maybe 30 35 miles an hour, you know, the girls airbags deployed
*  She's like I'm like, and if I was in the truck, I'm like, yeah
*  Okay, yeah I get out and the whole front end is destroyed she's days
*  I'm like so I'm trying to pry the door open and yeah there I see the phone on the floor
*  Still open. Yeah, and then her excuse was well my brake didn't work. Okay. I got my break didn't work
*  Does that ever happened? My brakes didn't I got rear-ended the same thing
*  But there was a slowdown on the right lane and some some guy plowed right into me and I asked the cops said, you know
*  It's five times five times a day. Yeah, I'm sure it's crazy
*  Yeah, it's it's weird that that sort of snuck up on us. There's this thing that's incredibly addictive
*  I was with my family this past weekend in Dallas and we're at this event as we're walking through this crowd
*  I'm like look how many people are on their phones. This is crazy like everyone
*  it's it was just you're going through the crowd of the store and
*  Everyone is just looking at their phone. Just yeah, it's like a zombie movie. They don't know their zombies
*  Truly is a zombie apocalypse. Yeah, truly. Yeah in the weirdest way
*  I mean it gives you a little bit of reward every now and then someone has a funny meme like
*  That's that's what Silicon Valley figured out is that the Pavelovian response and the you know
*  all the all the brain impulses you get from a like or a or a
*  You know a retweet or whatever it is or even just something. Oh, yeah, and we have different sounds bling-blong
*  All this stuff before we go any further we should give you credit
*  You're the reason why all this started you are the original pod father the legitimate one
*  Like if there's a lot of people claiming that yeah, you're the guy who made the very first podcast
*  You even came up with the name of it, right? I didn't come up with the name
*  We came with the name of it
*  Well, let me go back to to the beginning because actually the technology of podcasting was invented in 2000
*  So before anyone was podcasting before there was an iPod interestingly
*  I was living in Amsterdam at the time and
*  I was working with Dave Weiner who had who really invented blogging and he had created this
*  RSS syndication format and he had software where you could blog and then an aggregator kind of like, you know
*  Google reader at the time and you could you know read blogs
*  It was kind of like a two-way communication thing was interesting and a lot of people starting to use it
*  And in Amsterdam they had cable modems rolled out
*  Everywhere and cable modems were sold at the time is always on internet. It wasn't fast
*  It was just fucking on you didn't have to dial in which was oh my god. This is great
*  You know, this was a huge improvement you have to kick someone off the phone line all of that
*  so the
*  the
*  the the experience of
*  Multimedia was shit like you wanted to hear a song or play a video. It was like click
*  Wait wait wait download wait, you know
*  It would probably download and then open up some kind of player and then it was not an experience
*  There was nothing nothing there that made sense. So and I always wanted to broadcast on the unit
*  That's always been my thing from the moment. I saw it
*  So I came up with this concept of the last yard
*  So what if you had a little thing running on your computer in the background that would know if there's something you wanted
*  Let's just forget the how it knows part
*  It would download it and would tell you that there was something new when it already had it on its local hard drive
*  So you remove the whole weight experience because you don't know you don't know that this computer has been downloading something you've wanted
*  It just tells you oh, it's here, which is you know, it's not abnormal in media
*  You know the six o'clock news most of its produced before the actual broadcast. So
*  I took this idea to Dave and I said we need to come up with something that can
*  Download a media file that I program somehow like this is gonna show up and
*  Then it downloads it and only tells me when it's there and I can click on it and plays immediately and it it took some convincing
*  He didn't exactly understand what I was saying. He probably thought I fucking MTV guy
*  In fact, that's exactly what he thought
*  And
*  And then I actually demonstrated to him what I wanted to do in his own software and he said
*  Okay, I'm gonna do this
*  But only on the condition never ever ever fucking use my software again because that was horrible what you just did
*  And so we created the enclosure element in RSS
*  And so for two years we were doing back and forth, you know
*  Like movie files and stuff and oh click and it would open up and the experience was good
*  Until I saw my first iPod friend of mine said look at this
*  I'm like, oh, this is the white one with the big click the wheel on it. That was a good one, right?
*  They got hot after a while like big hard drive and I looked at it and went
*  This is not a digital Walkman
*  This is a fucking radio receiver because I had one I had a Sony AM radio trend receiver
*  Which is you know little solid state thing like this is a radio
*  This this can receive radio programming and so I said about again with my fantastic programming skills
*  to make a
*  Little application and you the iPod at the time you still had to sync it to iTunes
*  That's how you got music on to it back in the day
*  And so you could put a an mp3 file into a blog post basically
*  But it was a special attachment really and so this program would just be looking all the time
*  Is there something new is there something new? Oh, there's something new download it then click trip it so that it's synchronized to the iPod
*  and
*  It worked now not being a programmer
*  Actually, Kevin Marks the guy was working at Apple sent me a version of the script that actually worked
*  That was helpful and I said about creating a radio show, which we didn't have the name podcast yet
*  And I wanted to be able to talk to developers software developers who could create receivers. So we had
*  iPod or iPod or X iPod or lemon all the all these different
*  Applications which kind of did the same thing and because I was talking to developers
*  I called it the daily source code
*  So I did every day and source code is kind of what the developers work in and I was really talking to them like okay
*  Well the guys over in New Zealand
*  They you know, they've created this version of the app and it's really working
*  Well, and we discovered all kinds of crazy shit like you subscribe to a feed
*  Because we know what had thought it through we try and download, you know everything you had in that feed all at once
*  So I was trying to download 50 episodes and we still had kind of always on internet
*  So everything would crunch and die and this just kept building and building and other people started doing these and we called them
*  soliloquies and little bundles of joy and all kinds of really dumb names and the Danny Gregoire
*  Guy who was just listening. He said oh, this is a podcast and the name stuck
*  now
*  Ben Hammersley from the
*  Guardian years earlier had actually used the term podcast
*  Somewhere in an article which there was no podcasting at the time, but he envisioned that and and called it podcast
*  So he's the guy so he's the guy who named it
*  He used the term but I would say Danny Gregoire really named what we were doing at the time. So so
*  And that's what I didn't name myself the pod father where people started calling me that
*  And it just grew from there and that went really fast before I knew what the BBC was calling and the interviews here and there
*  I'm like, holy shit something blowing up here. Yeah, and it wasn't until
*  the big moment was I got a call from Steve Jobs and
*  He says actually was Eddie Q, you know, who's big man on campus there now. He says that can you meet with Steve?
*  I'm like, let me check my calendar
*  So as in
*  Where's the d3 conference like San Diego I think
*  Went there and I met with him for an hour and it was and I had I've met a lot of interesting people
*  My my best meeting to date had been Quincy Jones where I got drunk with him for an hour on the live radio show
*  Oh, yeah, that was fantastic
*  So here's Steve Jobs in the flesh. Now. The first thing I noticed is he's got a weird lisp that I'd not really heard before
*  Really? Yeah, it's like, okay, so he hides it when he does those
*  Maybe maybe doing when he's projecting just but he was much more personable and it's just the two of us
*  But first he's he's mad. He's fucking pissed off and he's yelling about they fucked up Wi-Fi and I learned later
*  that his
*  his plan always for the iPhone was to not be a cell phone but to use Wi-Fi networks around the world and
*  Yeah, and because you know Cisco or ever had changed the the way Wi-Fi works and the way the authentication works that it really wouldn't
*  Be that seamless, but that was his his vision and
*  You know, so I actually I thought to myself dude, you should probably calm down. It's gonna make you sick
*  And then he was talking about oh no Eddie Q says yeah
*  you know the RAA called and they got a problem with the with how we're able to
*  Record sounds on the Mac, you know breaking any kind of encryption and I said
*  Oh, that's actually kind of important because in order to record stuff
*  We're using like audio hijack Pro and all these all these different kinds of tools and I said mom
*  I hope hope they don't do that because it's kind of important for production and Steve went fuck it tell them to fuck themselves
*  This is tools our guys need
*  And then he said
*  Adam I'd like to put podcasting and iTunes. Are you okay with that?
*  Are you kidding me? Yes, I'll give you my director got built a directory of podcast
*  I'll give you that to start it off. Absolutely and then
*  It was kind of funny. So then maybe what year was this?
*  2004 something like that. I think yeah
*  2004 2005 time frame and then Jamie may you can find it if you want. It's a pretty funny video
*  So he announces this on stage playing my my podcast where I just rail on the Mac
*  Take a look at it's pretty funny. It's like it's the one video that really legitimizes me in the world of podcasting
*  Thank you, Steve. I really appreciate it. Oh, you got you got to check this out. This is hilarious
*  Well, I you could you could try to sell podcasts, but the whole phenomenon is so great
*  It's free and I think what we're gonna see is an advertising supported model emerged just like free radio
*  here's another Adam Curry is one of the guys that invented podcasting and
*  He has a podcast called the daily source
*  Let me go ahead and subscribe to that and now we can go listen to his latest one
*  You know just click on it daily source code show number one
*  80 something remarkable is happening here
*  Radio is springing free of the regulated gatekeepers who've managed what you can hear since radio was invented
*  It's jumping into the hands of anyone at all with something or nothing to say
*  Dollars worth of airplanes trapped my ass
*  The next generation radio content in my ears
*  That's right, it's show number 180 and it's Friday everybody thank God
*  I've actually had to restart the show three times. My Mac has been acting up like a motherfucker
*  It's something to do with the file system. Okay
*  He knew exactly what he was doing bro, I'm telling you he knew exactly
*  Oh, yeah, I do. Oh, you wouldn't play a clip that he didn't know. I love Kara Schwisher
*  With their mouth just like I was happening
*  And then he sent me an email later and he said I'm gonna introduce you to
*  Some people in venture capital Kleiner Perkins Sequoia Capital, which I kind of took as the thank you
*  And I went on to raise, you know a lot of money from those companies to build my podcast network
*  What what was the first what year was your first podcast the first one that you released?
*  Well, so that was 2003 I guess 2003 Wow. So what was going on before you? Was there anything?
*  Was there any other people have been putting?
*  Well, we had real video and real audio if you remember
*  So that was kind of like the low low grade streaming stuff and but this really made
*  It did two things. I mean it solved the bandwidth problem for downloading
*  That was the first and now that's no longer an issue, of course, but it put the subscription model into place and
*  Because neither I or Dave Weiner have ever patented any of this
*  It's completely free and open so no one owns it and that was that was the mission. I'm very proud of that
*  That's beautiful because you know, otherwise if someone like, you know, Spotify is now trying to buy podcasting
*  By buying up all these networks and they'll make it exclusive and granted
*  They're trying to switch from a music company to an audio company
*  But ultimately look at all the applications that are out there that are really good people love them, you know the Apple
*  Podcasts up I use overcast I like that a lot
*  There's you know tons of different ones and it's all because there's an open standard that no one can control and Silicon Valley loves
*  Controlling shit. In fact Apple loves controlling shit. This is one of the few things Apple has done
*  That isn't a walled garden locked into Apple stuff. It's interesting because they're not even monetizing it
*  No
*  And you know, they they have many different ways they could do stuff or they could help but
*  I don't know why I don't know why they're not I think it's an oversight
*  I think they thought for the longest time that it was just this thing that people did that was no big deal
*  And then it's become so enormous, but they still have this mouth this model they're operating under that
*  It's just they're just aggregating could be I mean and what was interesting is when they started off
*  They immediately started to highlight NPR programming which I'm not I'm I'm I'm grateful for
*  WGBH in Boston did a lot with putting their first programs making those available as podcasts
*  but kind of the
*  the beauty of
*  the
*  The amateurism of podcasting got pushed down a little bit and it was all BBC NPR
*  Yeah, it's a little too much for me the radio lab I love radio lab, but I know what you're saying
*  It's very produced. It's very like people answer questions
*  For the guests instead like you look cut in it. So what he said was this like why don't you just let him say it?
*  Right. Well, so this is why you are the Tonight Show of our era you have and that by the way
*  I feel like I'm playing the Super Bowl here
*  I mean if you see my my DMS and my text messages people like holy
*  Rogan this is legendary they're going nuts and and I'll shit, you know, like I'm gonna prep for the Super Bowl
*  You know, I've got to get ready to slam this
*  But you have
*  Taken what?
*  You've really done the opposite you've zigged everyone's ag and you just have a conversation
*  Unedited you're completely open type of personality
*  So instead of trying to rush in and get the information example
*  I am I like Eliza Schlesinger and I want and she was gonna be on Kim. Oh, I'll stay up and watch and watch that
*  She was second guest which kind of sucks because you get first guest, you know
*  And then a bit and all that and there was literally before she came on
*  It was six minutes of ads then a native ad in the studio for D's nuts
*  Then another five minutes of it was 12 minutes of commercials and Schlesinger was on for five minutes
*  Not even a clip. Yep, so people are sick and tired of it. I mean the existing media because of
*  Just the the structure that's in place the the ratings game that isn't really
*  Probably isn't really reality, but it's an approved methodology people believe in those numbers
*  That's still there
*  but
*  there's a reason why you get to Tulsi Gabbard and Bernie Sanders and people want to come on your show because you speak to an
*  Entire generation my daughter like holy shit. My friends are all telling me that you're gonna be on Rogan
*  She never never talks to me about any of that stuff like but you know Rogan. Okay, this is a little different
*  That's so yes. Well, it's not like you don't know it. I mean this it's weird. It's I do know but it's weird
*  Why do you think is why do you say it's weird? It's just weird. It's weird
*  Well, well, it was never intent
*  There was no intention like starting it from the beginning was just fun
*  And then I well this is cool and then once it got like a certain amount of people there was a
*  Point time where I started getting guests. So I was like you want to do my podcast and you know
*  It's right cool people like Anthony Wardane was one of the first well
*  I remember in the beginning and I've always wanted to be on your show
*  I think we've tweeted, you know, maybe seven years ago or something you were in Austin
*  But I always felt like it's doing some kind of pirate radio out there, you know
*  It's like what is this shit this, you know, there's something cool going on
*  Yeah, you know, you got all these people around you and and the comedic comics or comedians, which do you prefer?
*  Either one's fine. I don't think it matters. Okay, some people sticklers for it
*  I always find them to be annoying
*  So what I liked so much is that comedians gravitated toward it and said, okay
*  We can be funny and we can do stuff that isn't necessarily our jokes that are gonna get ripped off because that's what I think for
*  The longest time comedians would be like I don't want to be on the internet
*  Not put my shit out there because people will steal my jokes
*  Yeah
*  and they'll steal my whole routine and if anything you and comedians started to really blanket the landscape and
*  Show, you know what could be done with this and the fact that everyone could just kind of you know
*  Receive it on there on their phone was fantastic. We kind of created a real organic network
*  That's one thing that we all kind of talk about it that networks if you think of a network like NBC or whatever
*  You think of it's it's a controlled network with executives and shareholders and then there's
*  Yeah, there's all these different standards that you have to apply to this all and agendas, right?
*  Exactly, but everyone we're on the network together
*  We're on Tuesday at 8 and these guys are on Thursday at 7 and then all that so I made that same mistake
*  thinking that I could build a podcast network and run it kind of like
*  like a net hybrid network
*  Record company and raised a lot of money to do it too first mistake is that the VC guys they wanted us to be in San
*  Francisco who the fuck builds a media company in San Francisco, but okay
*  It just
*  Doesn't work for a number of reasons
*  But the main one is the advertising model is just not built for this and advertiser wants to know and I'm talking real advertising
*  Talking you know underwear and mattresses and and square space
*  We're talking automotive pharmaceutical, you know, right telecom. These are the real that's where the real money is
*  They want to know exactly what they're gonna be advertised on and if it's if they don't know what it is
*  They want no part of it, especially now as we have
*  cancel culture
*  Through social networking they want no part of it. So it's just not going to be spectacular
*  The way you know, you're not gonna take those advertisers away
*  What I meant by network is not that though. No, I know but that's what I'm saying
*  It's like I tried to build the contained network right failed in my mind
*  I mean people made money and everything that the investors didn't make money
*  But a lot of people tried to do that all things. They're still trying it. They're still trying it
*  It's just it's not that profitable and it's also the ones that are successful are successful and the other ones aren't and like the idea
*  They're all sharing revenue. It's like
*  Kind of eat with you kill
*  So what you what you're trying to say here about the ad hoc network is totally the way to go
*  What I'm saying is it just we didn't even think about it. We just were supporting each other
*  Yeah, comedians always suffered from famine syndrome
*  Because there was only a few shows on television and we were all trying to be on a sitcom or you were all trying to
*  Be the host of a late-night show and there's only a handful of sure everyone wanted to be that so that famine mentality
*  Was like it created a lot of weird animosity and competition between comedians
*  And then somewhere along the line the internet came along and then YouTube videos started making people famous and then podcasts started making people famous
*  And then we all realized like the old model of like hey if you do Leno
*  You can't do Letterman like there was a lot of that of course back course, of course that shits out the window
*  Now everybody does everybody show like Bill Byrd does mine. I do his we all do each other. I'll do Joey Diaz
*  He'll do mine. We're all friends and what happens is I hear a bill burr on your on your show and I'm like
*  Oh fuck. He's got a podcast, you know, Monday morning podcast. Boom subscribe Joey Diaz not necessarily my kind of guy
*  But yeah, he's off the hook his own podcast is kind of fun
*  So you are in a way kind of like a mothership the rising tide lifts all boats
*  That's that's how we think about it how how capitalist yeah, but it's not even that way
*  It's just like everybody gets to do well
*  It's not that you know, we're thinking of it in terms of an industry at all. It's really just fun
*  Mm-hmm. It just happens to be profitable, but the way we started it out with no thought whatsoever of it ever being profitable
*  that's why it became what it is because it was all like doing giant bong hits and
*  Hitting all this vaporizer and literally not even knowing what you're talking about while you're talking half the time and having fun with a bunch of
*  Part of the appeal because yeah, it's everybody wants to be at the party. Yeah, that's
*  Even that's why radio stations do remote broadcast, you know, that's why top 40 stations go to Popeyes
*  Yeah, and hey, we're here this morning everybody right everyone wants to be part of it
*  And if you're actually partying, yeah, I mean that's that's what people love. Of course. Yeah, we do these
*  Podcasts called fight companions and then there's some of our most popular ever
*  Yeah, and we'll watch fights and drink and smoke weed while the fights are going on and they're madness
*  Become total chaos. Yes, and those are some of the most popular podcast
*  Shout out to Ryan my dance instructor who's a huge fan your answer
*  My wife and I we we're dancing. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Yeah, it's part of my workout regimen
*  It is a work huge work. Oh, yeah, it's it's a lesson in a body coordination and awareness
*  I mean we do we'll do a double lesson
*  This has always been my dream
*  And you know, so finally I found a woman who this it's really do you dance all you ever danced a ballroom?
*  No, but I did have to take dance lessons for this movie Zookeeper that I did a few years
*  Oh is with the Kevin Kevin James. Yeah, I had a whole dance scene where those it was like weeks
*  I like that movie me and Leslie had this thing
*  so
*  it is
*  The man leads the woman it is a very traditional
*  Role in dancing, you know, or if you have two women dancing one of them has to be the lead
*  but in this case and the woman has to give into it and
*  It is for both of us. We find it, you know just for being together and I'm leading she's following. It's a total trust thing
*  There's all this
*  Interaction that you have which is almost frowned upon in today's society, you know
*  What the man is actually even me saying this oh you're leading oh you're leading I'm leading it's you know, it's called leading
*  But we do an hour and a half like a double lesson. I'm sweating like yeah
*  I'm in all your muscles everything and just look at them on Dancing with the Stars. These fuckers are cut
*  It's hard. You know, I talked to Chuck Liddell who is the UFC light heavyweight champion
*  He told me that dance with the Stars one the hardest things he ever did. I was preparing for it. I believe it
*  Yeah, it's hard. Yeah, he's real
*  It's a bumper sticker
*  It's a difficult thing to do and the cool thing is you can do it anywhere
*  Yeah, so, you know, we want to get to that
*  We've only just started a couple months, but we want to get to the part where we can just go into a place and just dance
*  Oh, look at that. Yeah, that's cool. That's that it's I I'm a big believer in learning things and taking lessons and just
*  Something you suck at just try it. So I got my ham radio license
*  Academically, I'm a piece of paper
*  I'm
*  Academically, I'm a piece of shit. I barely made it through high school
*  I dropped out of college in two months like this is not for me. This is not like me
*  I learned how to fly helicopters and
*  airplanes
*  So I've gotten all these these things and that's all not that I really fly that much anymore does helicopters
*  I know I know I heard that he flew me around downtown
*  Oh, yeah, and then is Robbie 44 22. He doesn't have his own
*  He was using one of the ones that this helicopter company right was a four-seater or two-seater
*  It was a force. Okay Robinson 44. Yeah, that's what I trained in. I owned two helicopters. Really? I had a helicopter
*  Company. Whoa. Yeah in Texas you could shoot pigs out of them. Yes, but that was he knows
*  This was in in the in the Netherlands. Yeah. No, believe me. I've been invited. I'm sure yeah
*  I've invited I don't like I don't like that idea. It's what it's a very unfair idea
*  But also they have to do something like there's no the pigs are problems
*  The pigs are a problem, but it's just like to me. It's like ha ha
*  I'm not a problem is that's the problem right? I like that
*  The problem is the joking around about it while while death is happening
*  Yeah, it's a disturbing and very unwinnable situation because the feral hog problem is so big
*  Particularly in Texas that you know, they lose millions of dollars in crops every year. Yeah many many real problem
*  It's just I just can't get into the 300 bucks an hour helicopter, you know, just shoot
*  Yeah out of the window. Yeah
*  It's a lot of food though. It does make a lot of food. They don't they donate the food
*  I have never shot a living thing. I have I've guns. I I've shot a lot of guns meat. Oh, yeah
*  Oh hell yeah. Yeah, I mean pigs are a good place to start. There's a place that does
*  Oryx, okay, and if you ever had Oryx, no, I have no oh my god. It's so good
*  So they has a conservation in Texas and it's actually more Oryx in Texas than in Africa, I believe
*  True. Yeah, because they're you know, they're they're really managing them
*  You can go there you can you know hunt him shoot him and then they'll do the dress of the whole thing for you
*  If you want you can do it yourself and that parts not for me
*  I don't know. I just I just don't think I can if I if I had to no problem, but not not
*  I don't have to know right? Yeah. No, I get it man. I get it. It's not for everybody
*  Shot something yeah. Yeah hunt. Yeah, I do bow and arrow right? Yeah, that's a whole different level
*  Yeah, it's well that this is my first animal ever shot that deer
*  I shot on a TV show called meat eater and I got hooked right after because I was I was either gonna be kind of
*  Vegetarian or I was gonna become a hunter, right? I would seen too many of those PETA videos you dress them
*  You did all that yeah
*  I got a buddy who does that Scott in in in Austin when I go when I help go elk hunting
*  We'll dress it in the field and quarter it
*  But then I'll send it to a butcher to get it chopped up right different cuts being I I love me nothing wrong
*  Yeah, it's um I understand what you're saying like to pull the trigger and to be there when an animal dies
*  It's intense, but it also makes you realize what you're doing when you're eating meat
*  Absolutely, yeah, and I think just knowing this I'm cognizant of it, and I I don't bless my food, but I think about it
*  I'm like yeah, thanks, man. Well. Thanks. Thanks, madam. I was in Utah
*  Last September and I shot this elk not only do these guys pray for the elk everyone takes their hat off
*  But they actually take a lot of grass that the elk eat and they make like a bundle of it
*  And they put it down on the elk carcass when we're done cleaning the elk so after the the bare bones of the elk after the meats
*  Remove they put this this thing down. They take their hats off. It was pretty serious right these guides
*  They do it with every every elk that dies
*  Yeah, yeah, because it's you know it's part of their livelihood, but it's also they're majestic
*  They're there and they're
*  They're delicious beautiful animals. Yeah, and they're so special. They're so interesting
*  Like if I could just eat elk for the rest of my life. I'd be happy doing that reindeer ever tried reindeer
*  No, caribou, okay reindeer in Finland had some reindeer
*  They have is a restaurant and then buddy of mine worked at Nokia at the time and they bring you a picture. This is it
*  I
*  Was like
*  And then there is so they serve them right before they serve I don't know that but they they do show you you know
*  This is the one you're eating right here. Wow. Yeah, that's intense. Very tasty though. It's fantastic fantastic meat
*  Yeah, it's caribou is a very prized meat
*  Yeah, and they're they're amazing animals too and they have these huge herds of them and I went to the North Pole and I
*  Saw just tons of them tons of them up there. Do you know the whole story with them and psychedelics?
*  With caribou. Yeah, no, I'm interested
*  Okay, caribou or are connected to a mushroom called the Amanita muscaria mushroom. They're addicted to this mushroom
*  They eat it constantly
*  They've they've actually been known when people do psychedelic ceremonies and they go outside of their yurts to pee
*  Caribou will knock them over to try to get to their urine because their urine is rich with the smell of this this mushroom
*  Yeah, they eat it constantly hence. It's a psychedelic mushroom the flying reindeer
*  It gets crazier ready the connection between Santa Claus and reindeers is very strange
*  The connection between Santa Claus and this mushroom is also very strange. The mushroom looks like Santa Claus
*  It's red and white it also shows up under pine trees. It has a mycorrhizal relationship with coniferous trees
*  So when it rains the the mushrooms will pop up under these trees. So these bright
*  Packages that look look that's what they look under the tree. Exactly. That is what they look like under trees
*  Boom. Yeah
*  It's crazier to dry them off
*  The shamans would pick them and then put them in the pine that could put that photo up again for Adam
*  Thanks, man, put them in the pine needles to dry them off
*  So just like like balls right in the tree right right and ornaments and a Christmas tree
*  Well, we still put pine needles in the pine cones in the yes exactly and and balls those bright colored balls
*  They think the origin of that was those things also
*  Santa Claus came down the Christmas tree and when or the excuse me the chimney when they were discouraging these
*  shamanic rituals
*  People had to sneak into people's houses to perform them on one of the ways they did that was to climb down through the chimney
*  so the shaman would drop down to the chimney with a bag of mushrooms and
*  Then they would all have these ceremonies and when these ceremonies were forbidden, that's how they that's how they got around it
*  Yeah, it's a the the relationship between Santa Claus and Christmas
*  This mushroom is very strange and there's tons of articles also
*  almost all of the old Christmas cards had the emanated muscaria mushroom on it and
*  Elves also the elves the connection I could ask the war I about that. He's he collects. He's an archivist
*  He collects old Christmas cards. Oh, yeah, I'll bet she has some of those find
*  Christmas cards with mushrooms just thousands of them. I've never done mushrooms. What I'm doing. No, no, no, thank you
*  Smoke we've even okay and I did DMT and enjoyed it very very much. That's a that's a wild one, huh?
*  I did it twice see look at these old old Christmas
*  Oh, yeah find some some ones that show like Mary look at that one right there in the middle. Yeah, there you go
*  See that one Merry Christmas
*  Trip your balls off kids. Yeah. Look they all have mushrooms. Oh my god in the early
*  1900s when they were making these and even in the 1800s people just more connected to the origins of these stores sure sure and over time
*  We've kind of lost that can only commercialize that into all kinds of but it's always the aminida muscaria
*  If you look at these, yeah the mushroom course, it's always that one mushroom that looks like Santa Claus
*  Wow, yeah, it's a weird mushroom though
*  That was a complicated mushroom because it it varies genetically and also varies geographically and also very seasonally
*  I've never I've done it before but I never had a good reaction out of it. I did it with my friend Stan hope and
*  Doug and I did it and we weren't feeling it and then we had some other mushrooms
*  We brought some psilocybin mushrooms. We threw them into them the the party and then then we took off
*  I'm not into eating any drugs. I like smoking flour. That's about it. Okay. I grew up in Amsterdam that made it kind of easy
*  Yeah, I'm sure yeah, it's um, yeah, it's it's tricky, especially when you don't know what you're getting
*  You know, but mushrooms are pretty pretty standard once you've done it a few times
*  You know what you know what you're getting into but that that mushroom and Christmas it's a very and anyway the caribou
*  Which is pull Santa's reindeer pull the sled, right? Well, they're flying because they're tripping their balls off. They're high as fuck
*  Wow, yeah the more, you know, yeah
*  I mean, that's probably the reason why those reindeer addicted to that mushroom. They favor it. They love it. Yeah
*  That's it's a weird one story
*  That mushroom also is a weird one in that when people take it they trip and then to really enhance their trip
*  They drink their urine because apparently the the in the urine contains like your body filters out
*  You get an extra like super blasts. Exactly. Yeah
*  Fantastic weird stuff. I'm trying to cut back on drinking my pee though. Yeah, it's good
*  It's just it's unsightly
*  Catch you doing it. They give you the weird socially so unacceptable, you know, just like what the hell you doing curry
*  Yeah, um, but anyway caribou I've never had it but I've heard it's delicious
*  I've had a bunch of different kinds of deer axis deer is probably the favorite. That's that's really delicious
*  That's another one is a weird. It's a weird deer because it's an invasive species in Texas
*  Oh, I got him in the backyard. Oh, do you have access here in your backyard? No. No, I got deer. Oh really?
*  Yeah, I don't know what white tail deer. I have no idea. Do they have white spots all over their bodies and weird horns?
*  Kind of like that. That's a mule there. You probably like many of those. I know I probably have white tails
*  I don't know they hiss. Yes how that we's at you
*  Shut the fuck up. Yeah, that's the girls usually they're letting the men know that there's yeah some danger here
*  Yeah, they you know, they just walk right through the backyard walk onto the street
*  They're all in we live in a cul-de-sac. They're all over the place. Whatever. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, that's what happens when there's no predators
*  It's becomes a real issue people slam their cars into them
*  I have a buddy who lives in Iowa and you can't even went to the rut like in November
*  You can't even drive. Yeah, you just across in the road everywhere everywhere you going
*  You better be going 20 miles an hour because they just dart out with a boner
*  They don't know what they're doing because the males pretty darn marbles basically rodents, you know, it's just kind of hell
*  They're not that wise. So yeah, I don't feed him just go away. Yeah, that's smart. Keep him going move on people
*  Yeah, but if you have like apples or something in your backyard, you know, don't have any of that
*  At least you guys don't have bears that's when it really is a pain in the ass and people got coyotes now though
*  I'll bet you do. Yeah, so a couple of those walking through the yard. Yeah, and they're the end. I have no pets. So
*  Then we've lost pets. I used to have so much. I used to have so many pets. I had everything
*  Yeah dogs cats goats
*  Feel free without them. I do. Yeah, I do. It's just
*  You don't really realize it until you know, you you're closing the sliding door
*  You're opening it up and you're not thinking shit, you know, right. Is someone gonna get out, you know, very free
*  That's a weird thing too. I always feel bad. The cats can't even go outside
*  Well, they can't go outside in Texas. They'll get eaten. Yeah, but it's just sad that they can't even go outside
*  Like what the fuck kind of life is that just living in a little prison?
*  I like a durable in a cage. Yeah, I don't like goldfish. I'm like any of that goats though had a lot of goats
*  Those are mean fuckers. Yeah, that's horses, too
*  I had a thing my daughter had horses and I like I had a castle in in Belgium and we had
*  Two horses there. You got a castle in Belgium. Yeah, I used to have money
*  TV money no, no, I took my company public in 96 called think new ideas and it was
*  One of the first internet marketing advertising companies and it was big we had 400 people was a big company Wow
*  And yeah
*  My buddy and I we just worked out and we took it public and back then it was like this is before the real
*  Dot-com craze so we raised 20 million dollars like holy shit
*  We couldn't believe it which is nothing these days and after all the lawyers never wanted taking their money
*  There was 15 million left. And so we started to build the business
*  and
*  What we're talking about castle you have a castle. Oh, yeah, so there was that and then I'd also at the time
*  Someone had said
*  I did pretty well on the on the IPO and I'm not crazy, but you know, okay
*  There's a you know, I learned what dilution means. I
*  Learned that pretty quick, but I'd invested fifty thousand dollars in some company and then I'd in 2000
*  just before 2000 moved to Amsterdam moved back to the Netherlands and
*  The bank called me said you sitting down. I said yeah, what's up? So you remember that company you invested in? I said, yeah
*  Well, it went public it was asked Jeeves and you know have 65 million dollars
*  I'm like, oh, yeah on paper on paper Joe so lock up you couldn't sell any of it
*  You know all this stuff so I did get some out but you know, basically wrote it down to wallpaper
*  How come you can't sell it? Well, if you're an insider, right you you lock up your shares
*  It's a it's an SEC regulation. So you can't sell for them. I think that it's negotiable, but it's it's
*  It's so the other investors who come in
*  Won't be like holding the bag
*  so, you know
*  Do the IPO and then all the insider sell their shares and everyone who just bought at the IPO then all their shit goes
*  Down in value and screwed so you have to there's a lock up typically six months or twelve months or eighteen months and
*  through some
*  Back-ended way out the hell was going on how bankers do it with swap and stuff and promises and derivatives
*  They were able to get some money out for me that I spent on helicopters and
*  I've enjoyed the money. Yeah, definitely glad I got the podcasting thing left. So how'd you get back to Austin?
*  Well, I so I had the company in San Francisco
*  This was a different company the podcast company and I was going I was living in London at the time
*  So I lived there for five years damn your international traveler. I have lived in a couple places
*  And was going back and forth
*  San Francisco London and
*  There was a breakup between me and my wife and we got divorced and so I stayed in San Francisco and then moved
*  To California to Los Angeles for
*  About a year. I always want to live in LA lives in the hills over by Highland
*  And it just didn't work for me, you know, I was doing basically the podcast and that shows me I'm like 12 13 years ago
*  And I don't know. It's just maybe it was that area
*  But I really had nowhere else to go and if I wanted to go somewhere I'm just sitting in traffic all day
*  It's like if I want to go to the beach. No, I was with a
*  Woman at the time who was an actress
*  Never never marry an actress man
*  Bad I was warned so she wanted to be in that general area
*  So just wasn't working for me and then I did a tour
*  From Virginia down to Florida the Gulf Coast for the show with an RV doing the show from the RV meeting people doing meetups
*  and it was it was just around the time when you had the BP oil spill in in the Gulf and
*  So people really depressed and it was all messy and just was not a good vibe
*  And I was gonna go straight up to Chicago and a buddy of mine Greg Lolley
*  Who was one of the true last independent record promoters who I'd known from San Francisco?
*  And he I knew him from Chicago back from the radio days and he said oh Adam come to Austin
*  You'll love it comes to come to off you stay at my place come to Austin like no, I mean I've never really been to Texas
*  You know, it's like that doesn't really interest me
*  I'm just gonna go up to Chicago and he just kept pushing and pushing as I'm driving up and then he says or I thought to myself
*  Greg is
*  flamboyantly gay
*  Single dad adopted a kid from Ukraine and if he's in Texas and he's still alive. It can't be that bad
*  Maybe it's just Austin. I don't know. So I visited and we did a meetup and this is in the summer
*  So it's about 112 degrees, but you know that Austin heat is not too humid
*  It's it's doable and there were 30 33 people at the meetup and
*  They were all happy and proud of their city and proud of their state and they loved what was just there was so much good energy
*  particularly after I just came from the Gulf and
*  one young woman her purse fell on the ground and
*  Outrolled a fresh pair of underpants and and a handgun. I'm like Texas
*  I've moved there three months later. Really I've been there ten years now Wow
*  It has grown though. Oh my god, it's changing. You know, this is talk about it too much. I
*  Mean I've lived in
*  My wife Tina and I's we got married in in May and we bought a house together
*  Southeast Austin, but we were living downtown
*  Right downtown. I had a place there and we moved into an apartment together and we just saw it happening
*  It really started with the with the scooters. That's really what started to mess up Austin
*  You know because they just overnight it's like what the fuck is this? I'm just there everywhere and you I mean Austin art been trying to
*  Create a bike vibe with the bike paths and you know, just all this stuff, which is
*  ludicrous and I grew up riding bicycles and
*  it takes maybe 50 years before everyone is accustomed to
*  Bicycle traffic, you know, it's not just something that's built in I turn right around the corner. I still look look at my right mirror
*  I look there so that make sure there's not a bike next to me
*  It's just built in though people don't do that
*  so people always getting hit and then these scooters pop up and
*  It's just mayhem, you know down everywhere. They're on the sidewalks. They're mowing people down people are you know, it's nuts
*  They go fast to just because they go very fast. They go very fast. He's got a souped up one
*  Mm-hmm. How fast does that bitch go like 50 25?
*  pussy
*  50 oh, yeah, I've seen him jacked up doing 50. Oh my sure thing. You're dead. Yeah. Well, there's that
*  Yeah, you're going down if it he's 25 is already pretty fast. He flies
*  Yeah, I think most of them do about 15 15 17 miles. Yeah, it's juicy
*  but what I noticed is because
*  all the Silicon Valley companies are
*  Opening up offices in Texas a lot of them in Austin and that's where they put the the the human resource heavy
*  stuff so
*  Not the top programmers. This is help desk
*  This is the people who review the YouTube videos
*  So, you know, they're already kind of wack because they're watching nothing but death and destruction and fucked up shit all day long
*  They don't really have a connection to the city
*  They're kind of like I'm here for a couple years and I'll go move somewhere else
*  So they don't care and they're on the scooters, right?
*  They don't really care about the city about the whole vibe like whatever get fucked up
*  And that's become increasingly more
*  Austin has some other problems
*  Now we're kind of following what what California
*  We're San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle, you know, we're following the let people camp it everywhere thing
*  So that's become a real problem and it's crazy here
*  You know, it's based upon it all comes from a lawsuit in Boise, Idaho
*  and that's where this started where
*  And the first went through the Fifth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit Court there was an appeal that said you cannot
*  Move people who are camping without having a suitable place for them to stay that you can offer them
*  Because then it is a violation of the eighth amendment under cruel and unusual punishment
*  That's why and that's what Austin's well until that's solved
*  It's cruel and unusual punishment to move someone who's homeless or not move someone who's camping if you can't offer them adequate
*  Housing so these people just camping on sidewalks there just like they do here. Is that the underpasses?
*  Medians, you know the underpasses. Yeah, it's crazy. And so it's this weird legal situation
*  Yeah, this really started well, they were they lifted the camp the no camping bad lifted it
*  So it was not a problem
*  Then they said well, we're gonna let anyone camp and it went nuts and all of a sudden downtown was just filled with people
*  Lay in camp and everywhere
*  Then they went oh this is not gonna work mayor Adler and City Council so
*  Okay, we'll ban it in the just in downtown, which is pretty much where the mayor lives
*  You know the W hotel this that you can't know camping in front of City Hall
*  But we have a we're university town. So you've got UT and it's just there's this whole like half of a
*  like a semicircle of camping and
*  Just mayhem right on the on the outskirts of the campus and you know kids are afraid, you know
*  Like now they're getting they're getting harassed. We have squeegee guys, dude
*  I drove into New York every single day from Jersey in 8990 and
*  You know, the squeegee guys were a huge problem and then they were gone
*  I think Giuliani like threw him in the East River or something, but and now they're back in New York
*  It's like this is not not a good thing
*  How do you fix that though the people are worried about the cruelty in fixing it there you go, you know, that's the problem
*  it's like you
*  it's a
*  You have you almost have to be cruel to stop that no, no, how do you stop? Well, you have to engineer some sort of
*  What are we talking about? Not everyone who is
*  Squeegeeing and loitering and and soliciting is homeless, right or you know
*  It's not necessarily something that they didn't choose a lot of people choose a vagrant lifestyle. There's tons of it particularly in warmer climates
*  Like here and I do a lot for the homeless problem in Austin as much as I can and none of it is sanctioned by the
*  City they're fucking morons. You know, just like oh we'll build affordable housing
*  Well, we'll get a hotel and we'll turn that in. It's like oh a slum hotel. Okay, great
*  the number one reason people become homeless is
*  catastrophic loss of family
*  That's the number one reason someone dies, you know this and then it just it's downhill from there
*  And before you know it you're out on the street
*  It's very difficult to rebound from that kind of thing. And so people need community. Everybody needs community
*  So where do they find a community?
*  Under the bridge that's where the community is and the community is
*  Transactional it's drugs, you know, it's you know, whatever you did. That's a community. It's not a healthy one, but it's a community
*  There's actually a
*  great project in Austin called
*  mobile loaves and fishes a community first village started by this guy who was in construction and
*  he just put down a whole bunch of tiny homes and
*  people who are if you're homeless you can go there and you can live in a tiny home, but you rent it and
*  There are some you know some prerequisites, but you don't have to be you know
*  Necessarily drug-free because it's your home so you can do whatever you want in your home
*  But it's like $200 or $250 a month most people if they do the paperwork
*  They can get social security or disability which will cover that they still have to you know
*  Either work there in the community garden to feed themselves a different, you know, like a auto detailing got all this different stuff
*  But there's no policing. It's not you know, this is this I think there's 500 people there now
*  And it's working out fantastically. Oh, that's cool
*  You know because they have community now that you an outside-the-box solution totally totally gets no money from the city because there's a religious
*  aspect to it, you know, there's a
*  Ministry part so oh we can't give money to that because you know fucking God nuts or whatever it is
*  But it's really working extremely. Well, that's great when someone comes up with something. Yeah, you know, I don't I mean people should look at this
*  Alan Graham is a saint what he did and he lives there. He lives in a in a small, you know small home on premises
*  Yeah, and if you go there, he'll be happy to show you around and they got all kinds of cool stuff
*  But just people are living together
*  He says so if Joe walks out in the morning not you Joe
*  But the other Joe and he's got his dick hanging out and he's like
*  Instead of the neighbors calling the cops
*  The neighbors hey Joe, what's going on man? Let's sit down for a second. Let's have a coffee. Let's see what's going on
*  Pull your pants up, you know, let's uh and yeah a community right community first village
*  That's that's the answer but that's not the answer that you hear from your local City Council your mayor's always
*  Well, we don't have affordable housing. Yeah
*  It's also there's a lot of mental illness that's a well, of course
*  But there's a lot of people with mental illness who have houses. You know, it's true
*  Definitely it's mental illness and drug addiction, but it really starts with catastrophic loss of family
*  That's the number one reason people become unhoused out here is the shift was Jimmy would you say about four or five years ago?
*  It really started kicking in somewhere around then yeah
*  Somewhere around four or five years ago. You just started noticing like villages of tents under underpasses
*  Yeah, and then I used to do fear factor in downtown LA like right down the street from skid Row, which is an extraordinary
*  Place if you've never seen skid Row and you drive by you go what this is real
*  Like this is downtown Los Angeles and you you're in which is which they turn beautiful by the way
*  I mean, they're really you know downtown LA became really nice some parts of yeah great great great infrastructure and everything
*  But then restaurants and cool really cool apartment buildings and stuff. It's an interesting spot, but then there's also skid Row
*  Yeah, which is just you can't believe the staggering numbers of people that are just camped out
*  Yeah
*  Thousands and thousands and thousands just a mass like people coming out of a fucking stadium to see a game Adam Corolla said
*  Said it really well
*  Forget where I saw him
*  He said it's like no one wants to be the bad guy no one no one wants to say okay
*  This shit has to stop we got to do something about this and it starts with stopping whatever you're doing
*  And that's a part of cancel culture
*  Yeah, people are afraid you know because it cancel cultural is real if you have something to lose like you have nothing to lose
*  I have nothing to lose they can you're you're bulletproof to a degree. I'm bulletproof you can cancel all you want
*  You're not taking away from me. No advertisers. I don't have them. You know only the people who listen can stop listening
*  That's the only thing that could happen. How do you monetize your podcast you know advertisers?
*  Well, we call it the value for value system
*  When Dwork and I started the show 13 years ago, it was just him and I just you know talking on Skype
*  I was in London. He was in San Francisco and
*  We noticed that because I'd like to read
*  Legislation I'll read bills already. I was reading the Lisbon Treaty which was kind of the European
*  It was supposed to be the European Constitution
*  Which was voted down by France the Netherlands and Ireland and then the European Union went no no no let's vote again
*  You did it wrong
*  Literally like revote and so okay. I guess we'll vote this way now
*  And then I was reading like this is this is not the way it's being portrayed on television like oh we'll have
*  It won't need a passport to go to other countries
*  We'll have the same money and I was seeing shit in there that was way different about you can incarcerate people you can
*  Deadly force by the cops would be legalized and none of this is really what's what's happening over here
*  The same time I read a book
*  Called I'm just gonna give you the background to get into the money part
*  Called legacy of ashes by New York Times writer David Wiener, I think and
*  It was about the CIA and my uncle appears in this book multiple times my uncle Don Greg
*  who was big big guy in the CIA for a long time and
*  And I called him up said hey Don have you read this he said yes, it's true
*  He said yes pretty much how I remember it. I'm like okay
*  So whatever is on television and radio is not at all really what's going on or what has happened and so
*  Started become a lot of work. We're doing work and then we said
*  Well, we'll never get advertised. We know the war acts of radio guys and media guys. So we understand understand it all
*  We'll never get advertisers that'll never work. So we'll just have to ask people to send us money
*  But why'd you say you would never get advertisers because it's too controversial
*  Advertisers I mean, yeah, we can get some advertisers but not the real advertisers now what we talked about earlier
*  Yeah, there's no advertisers really gonna be interested and also how do you you know, what are your what are your ratings?
*  What are your metrics? What are your numbers? You know, the certainly then the questions
*  Well, how do you know someone listen if it's just the download? I mean, I can I'm sure you've gone through all of this
*  Also, we didn't want to have a fucking meeting. Yeah, I have a meeting with advertisers. I don't I don't want to meet anymore
*  Meetings so but we did something different we said
*  Instead of saying send us five bucks. I don't work for tips. You don't work for tips instead of that
*  What is this show worth to you? So you just listened to us for a couple hours
*  You could have gone to the movies, you know
*  If you took a date had some you had a coke and popcorn 50 bucks
*  Was this worth 50 bucks up to you and what we discovered is that value is very different
*  Some people will say that's here's five dollars. I love the show someone else says here's five hundred dollars
*  That's how much I value the show someone else says fuck. I'm gonna give you a thousand dollars
*  that's how much I value the show and
*  we built this model where we
*  literally just say what value does the show bring to you and
*  We thank people
*  With the amounts that they gave were completely transparent. You can just sit there and see what people are giving us
*  And it just became this whole interactive feature where
*  Well, we put levels in so if you if you donate $200
*  You're an associate executive producer just like Hollywood the fuck to say
*  It's a real $300 an executive producer and we do a little mention in a different part of the show for the executive producers
*  And you know, they can read a note and oftentimes it's it was usually something about the show
*  So they're kind of brought into the conversation specifically
*  So it's not just a donation segment its content and we have like you have
*  Lawyers doctors nurses teachers college professors
*  tons of military
*  Lots of spooks and three-letter aid, you know CDC also it's kind of a spook agency is all kinds of crazy
*  People who really I think enjoy when we talk about what they're doing and so they love to let you know and it may be
*  Anonymous, you know, like hey man, don't mention my name, but you know, here's and that just grew and
*  You know now 13 years later we've we're feeding two families and we're very very happy and that's all I do is
*  You know twice a week Sundays Thursdays
*  We have a we do we do record it live, you know
*  We don't do any post editing or anything. It's in and out just done
*  And do you like the fact that you just don't have any connection to anyone other than your fans is ever satisfying
*  Extremely satisfying. It's it's not just fans. We call them. We don't call them listeners fans. They're producers
*  Every way of putting everybody is a producer if you see the amount of stuff that I get in, you know
*  So take coronavirus, you know, we've got a lot of people who are very specified
*  Not just in epidemiology, but in finance
*  Who can you know give us all these different insights and you put it all together
*  I'm really a professional information manager and I built a whole bunch of systems specifically for that
*  I just get stuff coming in coming in and
*  We like to deconstruct the media
*  So we'll play anywhere from 30 to 50 little news clips in a three-hour show and then just deconstruct it
*  You know, why is this being said? What is what is what is really behind this? Is it true?
*  And you know, then I spend a lot of time researching that's really what I do
*  I just research and look at stuff and bang it around look at this if I can from all angles as much as possible and
*  Then present it and it's often surprisingly accurate
*  Wow, I love that idea of calling them producers and I love the idea that you're not connected at all to anyone other than your fans
*  Yeah, that's perfect. The producers Joe. Yes the producer. I like it and then we and then we started to I guess the
*  Correct term would be gamify it so people started saying hey, man
*  I've donated a thousand dollars like in total like over whatever that's fantastic. We should reward these people
*  So we started to give them knighthoods
*  Why should the Queen who I've met why should the Queen of England be the only one who can do that?
*  We can do knighthoods. They're just as good you get a signet ring and some ceiling wax. Yeah
*  Yeah, you get a real wing a ring. Yeah, you could actually like close a letter with it. Yes
*  When people send letters to us all the time they got their meetups that people with their rings like, you know
*  It's like a badge of honor. It's a little culty. It has it's a little bit. It's unavoidable
*  There's a lot of different elements. I would say more like a church which can also be a cult
*  Yeah, yeah
*  You know, it's not an evil cult. In fact, it's a very healthy cult
*  We now have people are now doing meetups around the world where they come together
*  And you know, we have a no agenda meetups comm people can schedule it and you know, we've got all this that's another thing
*  We have all the infrastructure the entire show is run by the producers. So we have independent
*  architecture for our servers all of that
*  One run by void zero sir. Bemrose
*  They run it they do it, you know out of the love love and goodness of their heart for the show
*  Of course, they receive titles etc for that
*  We have an art generator where every show we have has new art
*  There'll be 10 or 12 different submissions. It's kind of a little contest, you know to have new art on every
*  Every new podcast is really exciting when it shows up in the podcast app something different
*  But we also have you know, oh my god, we have search engines
*  We have just all this stuff that guys and gals have just built for us and just kind of runs and it all kind of fits
*  together so we
*  Would never be able to make money
*  With this if we outsourced the production
*  You know paid production we wouldn't make it and I think it's very hard for anybody to do that unless you're at a
*  At a JRE scale which is a little different. I don't we don't even know how many people listen
*  We don't know we don't fucking care. I just don't know how many people is there's no actual way to know
*  There's no technical way anyone telling you different is full of shit. There's no way to know how many people listened just not
*  The Apple iPhone app does have some
*  Statistics that you can get but it's only iPhone statistics
*  You can kind of get an idea and you can extrapolate out that's recent that they have that
*  Meaning that you don't know how many downloads really or you don't know how many people I can count downloads
*  But how many people listen to it? You don't know it's and and even then there's a lot of network address translation that you may not
*  Be counting all the downloads. It's just technically not true
*  Unless you rig the listening side, which is kind of what Apple did and have statistics there
*  Which no one has there's no way to actually know who's listening. But for us it's like can I pay the mortgage?
*  Okay, great show. That's it. Mm-hmm. And that is it's like killing and
*  Eating the meat yourself. Mm-hmm. It's it's it's a version of that and I
*  Love it. We spawned a couple other shows that have the same system
*  Jen briny with congressional dish. I started a new one called mo facts, which has the same system ology
*  It is so fucking gratifying. It really I love it
*  I love the people who who help us who produce stuff for us and we'll go to a meetup people, you know donate on the spot
*  But they also love just meeting together
*  Without us there all over that like leap day
*  There must have been 14 different meetups around the world and I'm talking Israel
*  Australia
*  England the Netherlands just all all over the world
*  And they get together to just be in a non triggering environment
*  So you can say whatever the fuck you want kind of like our show, you know, no one's gonna get triggered
*  no one's gonna get outraged and it's all different kinds of walks of life and
*  They have one thing in common is like, you know
*  they think the media is kind of full of shit and and they support the show and they like those topics and and
*  You know, but there's no it's just it's small amygdala's man. Mmm, that's cool small amygdala's
*  It has been a weird it must be it's been a weird ride for us noticing how much more outrage people get at things today
*  than they did just a few years ago and
*  targeted outrage where people just decide that
*  you know, they're gonna start attacking you for something that used to be normal to say like there was a
*  Some of it is so ridiculous. It's crazy. Like there was a
*  Titania McGrath had a that's a great quick Twitter account. Yeah
*  Andrew shout to Andrew
*  He's got a post there was a sign that was hanging from a window
*  In the UK that it basically was the definition of a woman it said a woman a
*  female human being noun
*  right, that's like the sign and then
*  All these people went crazy and were protesting and saying that it's a transphobic dog whistle
*  Which is that's a new one, right dog whistles only been around for like two years
*  People calling something a transphobic or homophobic or sexist dog whistle like holy shit
*  Like you can't say anything anymore. Well, let's go back to the basics. Yeah, I was on the internet very early 1987 before the World Wide Web and
*  You may remember we had something called use net groups
*  Yes
*  and the use net groups and the way it used to work because you know, we didn't really have a widely spread internet back then except in
*  universities and I was on MTV and when I saw the you know, I'm like, holy fuck I'm
*  Emailing with kid my audience who were not counted in the ratings
*  By the way college audience don't count in the Nielsen ratings
*  At least didn't at the time and they want something very different from what MTV is playing
*  So I was like, wow, this is interesting
*  So I got into these use net groups and the way that worked is you'd post something and then overnight
*  It would be copied all around the internet and you had to connect to a special server and you pulled in the groups that you
*  Had subscribed to and so really it was kind of a it wasn't an immediate conversation
*  Post something and then people would reply back and I just kind of jumped in two feet and and immediately
*  Fuck you commercial MTV asshole. What are you doing here? Fuck off that you don't you're not supposed to quote like that
*  You're supposed to quote at the bottom and the top and I was like, whoa, what's going on?
*  And what that was is the minute you have the opportunity for people to say stuff anonymously
*  They turn into giant dick bags
*  almost everybody
*  This is just an easier way to do it. Yeah now we've made it so easy and with all the little the you know, the
*  the blips and the blooms and the rewards that you feel when something is posted or someone you know goes against you and
*  It's like the and again, I think amygdala's have swollen because of this
*  So then you get this this you respond differently to what you think is an attack and the attack read
*  You know this shit registers in your brain as something really dangerous and I'm gonna go back at them
*  But they're anonymous and that's the that's the best thing then the blue checkmark became a little more interesting
*  Which I don't have and I tried to get one for a long time and someone over there hates me and now really oh
*  Yeah, they wouldn't know that's what it is. They hate you. What else could it be? I've never gotten a blue checkmark
*  I don't want one now now to me. It's the mark of the beast
*  You got a blue checkmark, you know, I'd be looking over my shoulder man. It's like
*  so now that's become kind of
*  Those
*  Those are the people that now risk being deplatformed because you have status
*  Right and so it's fun to bang against these people like fuck this guy. I'm gonna bang against him
*  So it's some human nature that is that just exists within us
*  Like, you know, it'd be really easy for me to go online, you know under whatever Twitter handle that Joe Rogan you dick
*  I wouldn't say that to your face. Look at you, you know, beat me the fuck up
*  So no, but people have no problem doing that anonymous. Yeah, they don't see you
*  They don't feel the they don't when people look at you in the eye and they act like an asshole like they feel you like
*  What the fuck man? It's like a natural human instinct to not do that all the visual cues the human interaction
*  That's how we're supposed to talk you know the book connection the lost connections. I think it's a Harari
*  I think is the guy's name lost connections. He dealt you that's a guy you should have on your show
*  He delves into the same guy wrote sapiens
*  Maybe I don't know. What's his name? No, uh, Harari Noah. You've all Harari
*  Is that him? Look up lost you lost connect. Yo Han Hari. Yo Han Hari. Yes. Oh, that's the other guy
*  He's been on the podcast. Has he yo Han been on the podcast? Yes. Yes, so that's right lost connections twice, right? Okay
*  Yeah, I miss that one
*  That that human your eyebrows, you know, it's not just for catching sweat dripping off your off your brow
*  You know it's for communication. Yeah, inquisitive
*  All this stuff use all these cues are not not there in the deep platforming is getting really preposterous to for things
*  You know Zuby got deep platform. He got kicked off of Twitter. This is crazy. Who's Zuby Zuby is a musician
*  He's a rapper from the UK who's been on the podcast for me. The dude doesn't even swear. All right
*  He's back on so they suspended him temporarily, but this is why he got suspended
*  He's I forget he was having a discussion online about something and
*  someone said I bet I
*  You don't know what the fuck you're talking about something to that regard like I bet I sleep with more women than you do
*  To which he writes. Okay, dude
*  Oh transphobic. I I mean he didn't know he said I have no idea who that person was
*  Especially the UK it's illegal the UK you cannot
*  Transphobicize somebody and you can actually get a visit from the cops
*  But he even made posts about it like showing how ambiguous the probably like he couldn't figure out
*  He didn't know if it was a guy or a girl
*  He just know someone said that and he was like that's a ridiculous thing to say
*  I bet I sleep with more women than you so he goes, okay, dude, right?
*  Like what he's not even assaulting the person and they decided by him saying okay, dude
*  That is grounds for being banned from Twitter temporarily
*  Well madness and then these people are laughing about it and making light of the fact they were able to do that because it's a game
*  Right there you have a rock and they see a window
*  Yeah, they want to throw that rock and they got him they worked
*  They got him kicked off temporarily, but that sends a weird signal to everyone else because it makes you self-censor
*  It's it's not healthy for anybody. It's also not really a sustainable business model long-term mean Twitter
*  Because of this the cancel culture they said we're not gonna take any political ads
*  You know, yeah, that's why Jack Dorsey is gonna get kicked out. You see that ad
*  I mean to see that new thing with a billionaire guy just bought a shit pulse Paul Singer
*  Yeah, Paul Singer is he is a huge part of the Republican financial engine. This guy has been under
*  It's very interesting. He's doing this now
*  Because he's an activist investor and he's he's trying to get three or four board seats
*  He'll get them because you know of the amount of shares he's bought up like a billion at least
*  Because he you know sees the so-called bias against the right and he wants to skew that back all of that is a failed mission
*  The advertisers eventually want no part of this
*  They just don't want to have a part of it. The future is some version of a federated system which exists today
*  Mastodon if you'd heard of Mastodon
*  Can I pause you for a second when you say the advertisers don't want a part of it
*  What do you mean?
*  They don't want controversy
*  Any controversy?
*  Fuck no, they don't want
*  They don't want organized
*  They don't want organized attacks or bans
*  They don't want to be near it. They don't want to be near it. It hurts
*  I mean, that's why you see quite the opposite
*  You'll see procter and gamble and all these big, you know going way out virtue signaling as much as they can like oh
*  You know, we're all you know, you know sports illustrate is gonna have
*  For I think for the first time on the swimsuit issue will have large women
*  I'm saying that because that's what they are. They're large women
*  It's different
*  Are you allowed to say large still?
*  I am
*  There might be a time where large becomes a problem
*  What are they gonna do?
*  Yeah, well to whose
*  But and I'm not saying that's good or bad, but but that they're being forced to do this
*  It's not an organic thing. I didn't know I'm not really a sports illustrated guy
*  But I just don't know was this something that the readers wanted maybe I don't know I doubt it
*  So and again, it's not necessarily bad, but anything by force is fucked up
*  Go broke
*  Yeah
*  So this is gonna give it a chance and no one's gonna buy that episode
*  But that's another thing that I like about your show is you're you're a man. You're a dude
*  you're not afraid of it, you're not afraid to say it and I think it's very healthy and
*  I'm sure you get all kinds of shit all the time from all kinds of people for all kinds of crazy reasons
*  But it's important that we keep some of this just
*  Alive I get a lot of support
*  I mean, I'm sure you get some support some shit, but I get way more support than I do shit
*  Yeah, I'm a nice person
*  I just happen to be a male and I think it's okay to be a man and this the whole toxic masculinity thing is so fucking
*  Ridiculous like no, there's bad people some of them are men. There's bad women too. Like Casey Anthony
*  it's a bad woman doesn't it's not a
*  indictment against all women and this idea that men and
*  Masculine behavior is somehow or another negative
*  No negative people are negative
*  That's what it is. Exactly men just and this attack on men is so stupid
*  It's so it's to throwing out the baby with the bathwater. It's what it is. It's just dumb
*  It's just and it's dumb people that are doing it and they're doing it in an articulate way and in a passionate way
*  And they're using all their verbal skills to try to argue it in a way that they they seem to think that it's justifiable
*  But it's basically a tribal thing and then what you see is you see big corporations
*  Who do who if anything want to be on the right side of history, right? They will never
*  Go against the mob of course, you just don't go and so and it's not even the full perpetuate
*  It's not even that's like it doesn't matter
*  Very small the people are supporting you 20% of the people not supporting you is a large number if they're active
*  And it's it's it's such a waste of time. Yeah
*  So when are we smoking some weed because I'm about ready
*  Now I will say beware my Tourette's will get a significantly worse, but that's fine, but that can be entertaining
*  Since I was I was diagnosed when I was seven. I actually didn't know about it until my dad passed in November and
*  Jimmy where's that aluminum master that was here and my
*  This one there's a little one. No, that's not
*  Oh here
*  Yeah, there we go and
*  A little joint right here
*  and so he my sister, you know was talking to him and wanted to know a couple things and and and she wrote up a
*  little kind of like report and
*  I was reading like oh fuck see Adam was diagnosed at seven with mild Tourette's like they never even fucking told me
*  Thank you. They didn't tell you no
*  I've known it because I got twitches and things and
*  MTV was great for me because the segments were like a minute and a half and I can control it for a minute and a half
*  But
*  You know, I'm always like typically I can see out of the corner my eyes like not here
*  But okay, they got Joe on screen so I could do all my things. All right
*  What causes it? Yeah, I don't know no one knows
*  Shit firing in your brain. Does anything comment?
*  Well, it's not no, I mean, I'm sure there's some crazy-ass drugs, but I won't do that
*  Of course when you seem to have a very very mild version of it, why would you fuck with your neurochemistry?
*  It's who I am. Yeah, so I'm you know, I'm 55. I don't give a shit anymore. It's a part of me
*  I'm just saying it up front because be like the fuck is curry doing. Yeah, that's why that's why I love radio
*  I've always been a radio guy. You know, I can be like taken away and like no one sees me, you know
*  Oftentimes if I'm doing a long thing, I mean, I'll just be like completely
*  Screwed my eyes shot. Why not be into it? No one can see that right? Well, there's something beautiful about audio only
*  I mean, I really enjoy doing audio and video together on this show, but there is something pure to tobacco in this
*  Oh, no. No, no. No. Why do you want some with that? No, that's just no I stop
*  Yeah, that's why I pulled that one out. We have blunts here, which I like so I do
*  I've never done a blunt I do one but see how this goes
*  Where's the black rifle coffee, I mean I got the turmeric you want some yeah
*  The turmeric I'm just afraid my lips are gonna look like like I puked, you know, yeah, I know it does
*  But it doesn't really show up. Oh really? Yeah, not on camera
*  It's a little you get a little bit of a hue to your to your lips of the turmeric but that stuff's the lyric is fantastic
*  Yeah in the coffee with the layered Hamilton superfood blend. It's very very tasty. Yeah, no, it tastes good
*  I like the taste you're doing something good for your body. It's actually good for you
*  Legitimately I tell you man. That's the best thing for my body
*  The inside of a doctor's office or a hospital I mean I'm hanging together from THC
*  Texas is weird though, right? Yeah, it's medical. No, no, no, no medical. No nothing. No, it's free now. No, no, it's illegal
*  Oh everything even medical. Mm-hmm. God damn it. Mm-hmm. Jesus Texas. It's not like well in Austin. They've actually
*  Haven't really decriminalized but they're like the cops are I mean, you know
*  They really can't get away with letting people steal and rob and do crazy shit on the street
*  You know, it's like here in California. You can steal up to nine hundred and fifty dollars and then also go busting people for weed
*  so they really got better things to do so they're not really making a problem out of it, but
*  But it's still a bit silly someone wants to find a reason to arrest you. Absolutely. That's then it becomes an issue. Absolutely
*  It's just sad that Texas which is one of the most free places in the world
*  You can have a fucking giraffe in your backyard can't smoke a joint, but it'll change. It's inevitable. It'll change
*  Interesting because you know growing up in the Netherlands
*  where
*  Now marijuana was never legal. It was just they called it ogeluken to gestaan which means
*  We look the other way and it's okay
*  That's basically what it is and you know, it was it was limited to coffee shops where you can sell it
*  That's still kind of that way. You're not actually allowed to produce it. But okay, what the Netherlands Holland is a narco state
*  I mean all your ecstasy comes from there. Oh, yeah, everything is shipped through the Netherlands
*  All the techno of course it was the techno came with its own drug Dutch kickboxers
*  Were famous for coming out to techno music. Yeah, like Holland
*  I don't know if you know it was like the birthplace of some of the great boxes of all time
*  Not really MMA. Well, I knew all I knew some MMA guys. There's some MMA guys
*  Yeah Holland, but it's really famous for kickbox. Okay, I didn't know it was kickbox
*  Yeah, I really don't know shit about it
*  But I do know that a lot of guys there become very famous like the greatest of all time
*  There's like it's a crazy pool of talent that came out of Holland
*  Yeah, you know like well Ramon Decker's and Rob Kamen and Ernesto Houst and Peter Hertz
*  Like the names of these Dutch guys these off savage Dutch guys and everybody was like how Holland like what what's happening over there?
*  It's a is a very interesting country. I'm very glad I grew up there
*  Because it gave me a worldview. I think that you know, it's
*  Incomparable
*  So the drugs has never been a problem
*  You could walk into a bar at 13 look like you were 15 that's changed now look like you were 15
*  You could drink drink, you know beers order a beer. How old do you have to be to drink?
*  Well now they've changed it to 18 21 depending on where you are, but used to be
*  16 kind of yeah, it was very loose
*  I mean once the EU came into play and they had to
*  Harmonize and become the same as all the countries around it, which is not actually true because Portugal
*  decriminalize everything yeah, they they decriminalized I think maybe 15 years ago and
*  Spectacular results, but you can't really sell it
*  But you can get a prescription for almost everything including heroin you so they've they they've they've changed kind of that
*  But people have a really hard time with that. But hey, look, we're not putting a dent in heroin folks
*  It's it's going the other way. It's going
*  When I was a kid I never thought we'd have a heroin uptick in this country when I was a kid everybody thought of heroin
*  Is the stuff that killed Jimi Hendrix and stay the fuck away from it, right people overdose and then they die
*  Once you start shooting a needle boy
*  You fucked up like don't go that could never even imagine putting the needle in your in your arm
*  That was like not even an imaginable. It has the worst PR representation of all time. It's killed some of our greatest rock stars
*  Right Janice Joplin dead all these people Kurt Cobain commit suicide had a problem with heroin classically
*  Lead singer of Alex and chains at Lane Staley, right heroin so many these guys
*  Yeah, and the guys who kicked it who come back from it will tell you Jesus Christ
*  I was in Satan's lap like he had a grip on me. I could not get free
*  Yeah, and meanwhile, it's got an uptick. So what's the solution? The solution is clearly not business as usual
*  That's like the depth, you know, what is that expression the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over again a different result
*  Yeah, we know now that we have a problem. I don't know if legalizing it is the only way to fix it, but
*  To make it illegal. You're just propping up organized crime. That's all you're doing
*  You're not stopping people from doing it because these people there's a giant percentage of them that are doing stuff that a
*  Pharmaceutical company made that they got illegally now. They're selling it. We write they've become drug dealers
*  Whether it's the cartels or or other people Joe
*  You know, we had the financial crash in 2008, yeah, I don't think the trillions that we put in
*  Really saved us. I think the drug trade in general was the only thing that kept the economy running at the time
*  I mean, this is so big the money in drugs is so astronomical
*  It's you don't even you can't even fathom how big it is
*  A lot of in yeah so many industries pale in comparison. I mean H it
*  HSBC was literally
*  You know laundering the money from Mexico with drug dealers just coming up on the Mexican side
*  Throwing millions of dollars a day into the deposit and it got you know
*  Pushed out the other way into the legal system. James Comey was running that at the Jesus James
*  He was well aware
*  It's just nuts how much money is involved in in and how many people look away, you know, people are trying to stop
*  Different flavored tobacco smoke. I see you're a vapor. Well that that I actually looked into that very very deeply
*  This was that the tobacco industry had a problem. The problem was this I I kick
*  Cigarettes with this because it's just you know, you can have nicotine in it or not
*  But you know, it's not and if you had any health consequences from using that thing zero keep hearing about people getting lung issues
*  Well, okay
*  So a couple things happened the lung issues and I don't know who you know personally
*  But there was this don't know anybody personally
*  there was a scare and the scare killed a couple of people like ten people and what it turned out was that was people who
*  had vaped THC cartridges and
*  Some could you know the people who put the you buy your THC?
*  Cartridge from a dispensary here. It's actually packaged by somebody else not by that person
*  So you have you know King World or whatever these different, you know, that's kind of a reputable brand
*  But it's packaged somewhere else that means putting it, you know putting the stuff in and they put in some vitamin E
*  acetate and that just kind of like created a what you know heat that up and became a web of
*  Some shit inside your lung and fucked you up. So that's a bad thing, but had nothing to do with
*  Vaping nicotine with it with the typical chemicals that you get from reputable companies
*  Is the the the vaping from marijuana with their process is more problematic than the vaping of tobacco
*  Well, it certainly was in that case because someone changed the formula
*  then you need to have some some oil in there in order to keep it, you know liquid and for it to
*  Just for it to be able to go into the vape and not the issue was actually the vitamin E oil
*  Yes. Yes, and and so that stopped of course somewhere someone did something shitty and that happened
*  Really high guy actually said this to me once
*  He he told me that he uses organic MCT oil for his his vapes and he was like handing me his vape
*  I'm not sucking on your vape. I don't even know you you could be a crazy person. You could be you could be DMT vapes
*  They have DMT vapes now. That's somebody hands you a vape pen. You might be going into orbit
*  For 20 minutes, yeah for 20 minutes. What if you're driving? Oh
*  You know, well, I think you know, I've flown a helicopter high on DMT no no on weed
*  Oh, that's a different animal. Yeah with an instructor, you know, he wanted to see how I did it and it was perfect
*  Yeah, I play pool, which is a very sensitive thing. Not quite the same as death by helicopter
*  But you're controlling the rotations of a ball. It's very delicate
*  Literally the amount of effort you put if you like you if you watch a good player the amount of effort they put
*  Really accurately depicts how many revolutions of the cube?
*  Oh sure
*  Yeah, and after it's colliding with the object ball and you get more sensitive to that when you're high
*  Yeah, jujitsu is another one a lot of people do jujitsu. Really? Yep. It's really really really common guys
*  Smoke out in the parking lot and then go roll. It's really common. Well, that was I did the most perfect landing ever
*  When I when I was super into it, oh, and it's very small input the helicopter you've seen it. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  anyway, so
*  The tobacco industry had a real issue and that it also comes back to the states because there's this master agreement that was put in place
*  Decades ago that tobacco companies would pay a percentage of their sales to all states to
*  as a pre compensation for whatever fucked up shit people get from smoking tobacco and
*  All these states wrote big bonds against that money
*  And so when the income from the tobacco companies was decreasing significantly because of vaping
*  All of a sudden the states are going especially this one
*  What the fuck we have these bonds these bonds are gonna, you know become go bust
*  That's you know when you have your your state bond go bust, you know, this is a real problem
*  That's a financial issue states and cities and everything go broke
*  So everyone had an incentive to get rid of vaping get people back on tobacco
*  so
*  They Altria bought jewel
*  The the vape that's really that I mean this isn't this is you know hardcore. This is you know got a battery
*  It's all technical you get the vape juice jewel is a pre-packaged product kids were buying it
*  Like what is the benefit of that over a jewel?
*  You can control how much the straw is it look like dragons
*  And you can you can put whatever you want in it not just limited by what jewel wants to sell you so
*  That's coffee black rifle coffee in the house it comes with
*  Nice
*  The mug is yours, too. Oh, thank you keep that mug. I want one of yours though
*  Do you have a mug do you make a no agenda mug? So no agenda shop comm which we don't run
*  They got these guys and they just send it donation from time to time
*  You can get mugs and t-shirts and all
*  Yeah, so what they do is they they go to the art generator they get images off of that
*  Then they put on t-shirts mugs hats whatever they sell it give a third to the artist
*  They keep a third and they eventually give us some money, okay, but you know we've always said nope
*  Just do whatever you want. We don't care. We don't care. It's a
*  Kismet is a kismet kiretsu. I mean, that's a better word. I don't know what either one of those mean
*  Do you know what those I don't know either just sound was it means that's like something Larry Ellison would say
*  isn't kiretsu when
*  two companies
*  agree in like Japan to do some kind of you know
*  Business together with our without a contract. Okay. Yeah, those are nice contracts
*  Verbal ones from PEE trust. Cheers. Yeah, it's like we got together to do this. It's way overdue way overdue for sure
*  But those are good relationships when you have a relationship with somebody we don't have any paperwork just like each other Dvorak
*  And I you know we eventually we had to you know do an LLC because the the the IRS was going
*  Understand you know people send in checks they do PayPal you know give cash
*  So we have you know all and they're just like you just make a little simpler
*  Can we just cutting it down the middle because you know there's no one else involved yeah
*  And but otherwise we just had a handshake
*  You know for for a decade
*  And it's like you didn't ask me to oh is this my release yeah
*  You didn't ask me to sign a release a fucker, okay?
*  We made that be just in case because you don't want to get sued by yeah, well you can you know of course
*  You're a weird world. Yeah, particularly well you got in celebrity guests on yeah, and this
*  the only thing I have to be careful about is
*  Slander I guess yeah anyway back to the because you like this story, okay, so tobacco states everyone's keyed up
*  They buy jewel for 18 billion dollars. They buy it as a write-off
*  They want to get this company out of the market
*  Then they go to the FDA and they start all this shit about flavors flavors flavors flavors. You saw it everywhere
*  It was massive. It was a perfect storm
*  We got ten people dying from vaping something completely unrelated, but vaping e-cigarettes. He had an e-cigarette
*  He died it was actually yeah
*  He vaped but he vaped a bad TCH cartridge and you know got a severe problem
*  So you know how the media plays that and it just kept on spinning spin
*  They're like well
*  We have to stop the children and the way you stop it is by taking away the flavors because children they want flavors
*  That's what the problem is so that fucked jewel over and then actually Altria who you used to they bought Philip Morris basically
*  So it's the biggest tobacco company
*  They start they already wrote down half of it like just taking the fucking L on it
*  They want to get rid of it because in the wings they had their competing products, which is IQ OS
*  I quit ordinary smoking small I capital Q OS and it heats
*  Tobacco, so it's a it looks like a vape pen it has but it actually runs on tobacco and it doesn't burn it
*  It heats it up has whatever
*  Some kind of mechanism in the filter you inhale and it's almost their dream
*  Which is the smokeless cigarette very close to it, but most importantly it's not a nicotine
*  Synthetic nicotine it is tobacco product
*  Which is their business and they got they really ratcheted this up so high that they got Trump involved and Trump actually with Melania
*  They did a thing with Alex Azar the Health and Human Services Secretary. He said
*  Well, you know be this vaping is very dangerous. We have a kid actually
*  You know was one of those moments where everyone loves to jump on Trump
*  He said Melania has a kid, you know, he forgot to say it was his whatever it was and
*  Now he's actually been overheard saying I wish I'd never gotten involved in that fucking thing because he figured it out
*  He figured out was a huge scam
*  The bill has been stopped, but now they're still trying to push through
*  A bill that will help the tobacco companies even more by outlawing any type of flavored
*  E cigarettes or juice liquid or what they just want to get rid of it. So it's really like who killed the electric car
*  It's exactly that and they just go look at it now IQ OS. They're launching. There's new stories today that say oh
*  My god, it's the saving grace. We have the new product
*  We've all been waiting for right at the moment that vaping is gonna kill you
*  It's hooking children because of flavors
*  So do you think they're they're hiring people to write news stories and the news?
*  Organizations are picking you up because they're being told to just do a press release to do a press release make come on
*  It's so easy than media to do a press release and oh by the way, we're Altria. So we're gonna buy
*  500 million dollars worth of advertising over the next five years
*  Would you please run our story or you know, you might want to look at this. Come on it tobacco
*  So do you think that they make a deal before they accept the press release to do advertising or they wait a little bit
*  You know, it's you don't have to say anything. It's just
*  Yeah, it's implied. Why do you not know? Why do you not hear the discussion about?
*  Over medication of children on television. There's a look at the number one advertiser, right?
*  You if you start talking it's just not discussed
*  You can't have it is a controversial subject and it would be a good subject
*  It's not because I get a lot of people paying attention to it
*  It's right
*  It would get a lot of ratings if you have a lot of stories about over medication of children people like what what is going on?
*  It would be something people be interested in. Yeah, and yet they don't do it
*  Because the advertiser I mean just look at look at your advertiser
*  I have to turn off the sound these days because I'm sure
*  That I'm being blanketed with so many ads that eventually I'm going to get propetia. Eventually, I'm going to get high blood pressure
*  I'm getting my dick's not gonna work because that's what you're telling you every every commercial block
*  Yeah, everyone. It's pharmaceutical until you know, like cable news, especially because an older demographic
*  but even if you watch
*  what is it what do they have a
*  Where they have two and a half men running all TV land two and a half men and what's the other one Doug and Carrie?
*  I don't watch those. Come on. Kevin James is a two and a half men. No, no, no the Doug and Carrie
*  Where's the UPS?
*  Queens King of Queens. Yeah, but I don't watch sitcoms. I can watch that. That's a funny show
*  I can just watch it over and over again. Good dude, but then every commercial break
*  Boom drugs. Yeah, what is it? Which documentary was it there that had a description about the United States saying that we are
*  one of two countries in the world that allows
*  Advertising yes, I think Australia is the other thing. It's New Zealand. Okay, it's either Australia
*  Sorry either one because that's like a real fuck-up
*  Yeah, call out the wrong one of those things. I'm pretty sure it's New Zealand
*  Uh-huh, but that for whatever reason that everybody else is like, what are you crazy? Yeah, and once we got it in there
*  It's like once something becomes something that everybody does we are crazy. It's really difficult. It's crazy that we do that
*  I'm gonna get you a blunt but this coffee by the way is
*  phenomenal
*  You are legit man
*  Coffee
*  Yeah, Evan Hafer and Matt best
*  That's pretty good though. What is this?
*  My mother would roll over her you know, you know grave she saw this well, she's dead
*  Oh, but she didn't like it, but she would just be like I don't know your mom Joe
*  I mean, it's like, you know, my mom smokes pot. Yeah, my mom was not a pot smoker
*  My parents were hippies I grew up with the Emily Post
*  Etiquette, you know, okay. I still if a woman comes in I'll stand up at the table. Oh
*  Texas that's I love that
*  One of the things that I really love about Austin in particular
*  Is this kind of a hybrid of hippies and Texas people? Yeah, you know, that's how I feel. Yeah, and I like that
*  I like I like having guns. I like the whole idea of you know protecting my family
*  Yeah, and being able to take out an evil government. Yeah, I like that
*  Well, that's what it's for right? The second amendment is to protect the First Amendment. That's that's my view
*  And we got a culture is you go we have a gun culture in Texas
*  So and also people are really nice in the car to each other. Yeah, it's like go ahead man
*  You have a fucking guy everybody's got go ahead. I don't after you bro. It's fine. No, there's no real road rage
*  Well, there's that expression right a well-armed societies a polite society. Mm-hmm
*  Now I'm not saying that that's my rainbows and unicorn vision of the world. I'm not either but it works
*  Yeah, it does work. It does work. There's places where people are armed that it's a really nice place to be
*  It doesn't mean bad things can't happen there and when I say that things very interesting this stuff
*  Yeah, I've never done a blunt. Oh, it's good, right Charlie Murphy got me in any so that's a pre pre-made blunt. Mm-hmm
*  Yeah, Charlie would actually make them. So how much tobacco is in there versus it's the leaf on the outside
*  Is it rolled on the thighs of virgins? I don't believe so like Bill Hicks bit. I
*  Don't know Bill Hicks is bit I do know that some cohibits are supposed to be rolled on the thighs of virgins
*  Well, it's marketing Hicks had a bit about good marketing. Yeah, I forget what it was rolled with Claudia Schiffer's pussy lips
*  I think that's what he said. I've never been into her
*  Hot yeah, she's definitely skinny. Yeah, but um, it's um, wasn't she married to David Copperfield
*  She's still with him or was with him for a long time. I don't know. I try not to pay attention
*  Who's fucking who it seems like?
*  It was a while ago any kind of celebrity this or that it's going down. I don't know
*  She still looks hot though. So a picture of her. Mm-hmm
*  Some of them gals can keep it together
*  Good skin. Yeah, good skin drinks a lot of water good habits, I guess
*  Mm-hmm. I'm so back to the vape pen thing
*  Yeah, so someone needs to make a documentary that that is a crazy little sneaky move or at least a YouTube video
*  Multi-billion dollar scam
*  Propagated against multiple states in the United States and free choice of consumers
*  All to protect an industry that essentially we're trying to get away with with vaping
*  Yeah, because I've been an addicted smoker all my life
*  smoke cigarettes from at least 15 probably earlier
*  Then luckily got into weed and smoke, you know been smoking all my life pretty much
*  But I still would you know would roll it with tobacco
*  Which does give you an extra delivery mechanism an extra kind of kind of kick
*  Yeah, but then I would just from time to time just smoke one a cigarette and I really it was first of all
*  It's chemicals and all kinds of bullshit is in there stinks the things at the house. Yeah, I want to live longer
*  You know, so is this great no, I'm sure it isn't you look very good for a person who smoked a long time
*  I'm 55 you look great for 55. You really do you look a lot younger than I think if if you if you took me and
*  Compressed me down. I'd look like you
*  That's gonna be really long muscles like we push it all down. Yeah, it would be better
*  Yeah, but your health is like you look like a healthy person
*  You look like you're doing well, so do the dancing and I go to ride indoor cycling. Oh, I do spin. That's excellent
*  Oh my god, and this is more like a dance kind of oriented one music and it's just fucking loud music
*  And it's all in rhythm and you've kind of got a group vibe going on and and cardio of course is fantastic
*  They also do weights, you know, oh cool three pound weights
*  There's something really cool about doing stuff with a group of people, you know more any kind of difficult thing
*  Yeah, everybody's pushing everybody. Come on. Let's go. It's fun
*  And so a lot of spin classes are really that really competitive like mava
*  You see the peloton ads like that's not what this is. This is you do you're standing you're sitting you're tapping back you're doing
*  Crunch crunches you're doing push-ups
*  All to the beat so the faster the beat of course the faster you're doing it
*  so
*  It's it's like dancing
*  but then on a bike and I
*  Like being yelled at in a dark room
*  Right
*  Boot camp vibe and I know I so I don't have my hearing aids in I don't my glasses on so I'm kind of like
*  You're blurry right now
*  But I can't see so I can't see the hottie instructor up there doesn't make any difference
*  There's something about the vibe so I get into it
*  Yeah
*  Tell me about the hearing aids because you took them out when you got in
*  Oh put the headphones on and this is from listening to music too loud
*  No, that would you think you think you think no, I have a genetic
*  Problem that I didn't know about until three years ago and
*  So it's not and I you know went to an audiology well, here's what happened I started noticing
*  Tina and I had been together for a couple years. I started noticing I was saying
*  Excuse me. What I just I wouldn't hear stuff or she would say something that I couldn't remember hearing and
*  And I brought it up to her and I said
*  Do you think I ask you to repeat something a lot says doesn't really bother me and then says but the TV is very loud
*  So really the TV is very loud said oh, I don't even realize that so I went to an audiologist and lo and behold
*  My grandmother
*  On my dad's side was completely deaf almost from her teens. So I have some of this
*  But it's been okay only as you get older everything the levels you know to see like here's a level where you can't hear
*  Here's a level where you can hear everything and I was already kind of there
*  So now it's just due to age just everything goes down a bit
*  And so I'm missing 1k and 1 kilohertz and missing different different tones
*  So I went to an audiologist and said well, it's very mild
*  But yeah
*  This can make you repeat stuff and it will get worse over time and what actually happens to a lot of men in particular is that
*  They become very isolated from the world
*  They don't even realize that they have a hearing problem
*  And now the difference between having them in and taking them out is massive
*  um
*  Just you know, I can hear how much less it is
*  Another clue was that I have a for my all my podcast radio work
*  I've you know headphone, but I put an extra amplifier on it. You can see you can still hear it today
*  Sometimes i'm talking and it'll leak just a little bit because I have it so loud now
*  That's not going to damage my ears
*  But the problem with anything you put in your ears you don't you can't hear the sound anymore
*  And I like our processing our eq. It's very important to me so I can hear that without the hearing aids
*  But not with the hearing aids. Oh, that's interesting. So the hearing aids give you a different kind of sound
*  Well, so today's hearing aid is not your your grandpa's, you know
*  Geriatric brown goopy looking piece of shit that makes you look like just a total moron like
*  How dare you you did the face I did the face
*  Hey, I have disability here. I get I get a victim card. Okay, you can get a probably a plate
*  boundaries out of boundaries, okay, so these are the um
*  Widex evoke these have 35 channels of compressor limiter multiple settings
*  Um, it's an in-ear so it goes right in into my ear
*  um
*  I still have a little bleed through from the outside world but because so usually an audiologist sticks this thing in your ear
*  Makes you do all the tests and then they'll sit there and they'll sit across from you and they're going to program it
*  So that you can then hear
*  normal sound
*  Which is very it's a very you have to be a trained professional. It's very hard to
*  Um fix someone who has never heard what is proper
*  Okay, um now i'm a little different and i'm also way into sound and so it's a whole racket
*  These things are three and a half thousand dollars
*  It's it's a huge racket and the way they do it is the manufacturer you can't buy from the directly or from retail
*  You can only buy it through an audiologist
*  so they're already getting half the money, you know the 1500 at least and you have to have a
*  Uh, you know appointment so there's all this money that goes on top
*  And then you come back after a couple months and they tweak it you come back again
*  So I said
*  look
*  See who I am. I've told you what I do
*  Give me the fucking software. She said oh, no. No, I was going to give it to you
*  I just wanted to do one session with you said you have to have this
*  So I have I have pre-programmed like six different programs so I can do one just
*  For music I can do one for television
*  One for social situations and I have one that and I so I did it all myself all these
*  35, uh different channels of compressive limiter
*  So when i'm walking around what I hear on my ears is like a radio show like the sound
*  Like when i'm talking right now, I hear my own voice
*  It all resonates because i've jacked all that up. So i've made my own
*  um
*  Sound reality of sound wow, but I also have one I can set it to a setting in the mall
*  I can hear a conversation from 50 feet away
*  Whoa
*  Was my my special my eavesdropping setting now the only thing that doesn't work is you can't have headphones because that
*  That doesn't work having the the hearing aids in with the headphones with the sound
*  Yeah, because you're blasting into the microphone and it really doesn't work
*  That's crazy though that you can hear people having a conversation 50 feet away. Can you focus in on people by turning my head?
*  Yeah by turning my head
*  There's I mean there's a lot you can you can focus you can have it automatic. So the problem is
*  The way i've set it up
*  You can drop a pen there if I don't see it. I might hear it over there
*  Yeah
*  Now that's always going to be a problem they have they have a an algorithm that will try to guess where the sound is from
*  And tell your ears that
*  Um, so basically i'm not the guy you want in the battlefield
*  It's like telling you where the shots are being fired from. Oh my god. That's hilarious. I just can't hear it. Wow
*  but just for uh
*  Yeah, so it just doesn't work with headphones. That's why I take them out
*  It's amazing though. They sound incredibly potent like oh, yeah
*  You remember, I mean, you know what real sound sounds. Yes. Yes, everything sound real to you or is there a well
*  What you automatically do? Um
*  Because I was able to do it. I it's having a conversation. I have different settings for different situations
*  So if i'm at home, it's relatively quiet or we have some music on or you know tv or whatever
*  um
*  Now I have the tina frequency which is you know, kind of like one kilohertz and and that's where I hear her better
*  And so that's uh jacked up a little bit
*  And then if I hear you talk I can hear it'll be a little
*  I can hear it's not exactly you it's a little too tinny maybe
*  So but that's just me. I mean that's not everyone's experience, of course
*  But to me it's the disability has become incredible joy
*  Because I I have like virtual reality on my head all the time just saying that you could probably fuck with someone's voice like a snapchat filter
*  Well, you know make them sound like a cartoon. It's really advanced. I mean you can um
*  Connect to an iphone so you can you can stream wirelessly
*  um
*  You can do like
*  If you're driving with directions with the maps, then you can just be talking and in your ear all of a sudden
*  It's like hit the light turn right. No one else hears it. There's no wires. No nothing
*  I got you know, you wouldn't even know I had them in unless you look
*  Yeah, we're becoming cyborgs. Oh, no, that's
*  Although i'm against it. That is a part of the the road to transhumanism, right?
*  But how can you say you're against it where you you're enjoying this thing?
*  This to me is more it's not a replacement. It's an enhancement. Yes, you know and that's how they're gonna get us
*  When the first guy gets his legs removed for for artificial carbon fiber legs that you could feel but that can run
*  That'll happen miles an hour when the first guy gets his legs removed. Yeah in favor of new legs
*  That's when we're gonna go. Holy shit
*  Whenever I tell my radio buddies about my hearing aids, they're always like, oh that's fucking cool. It's cool
*  I want that too. Like I want that don't get me wrong. I'm just
*  Looking at the bleak landscape ahead of us by the way beware. I just I want to say something because there's a lot of um
*  They're not called hearing aids. They're called hearing amplifiers. They have some fuzzy legal language that are coming on the market
*  You know that you put all the way in your ear the rechargeables. We've got a whole bunch of them
*  They're much much cheaper
*  Um from an audio standpoint, i've done it for you know, 40 years
*  That's not the way you want to go if you seriously want to know how to if you want to hear properly again
*  So see an audiologist is what i'm saying and there's lots of different, you know, it doesn't it's not all three and a half thousand dollars
*  It's more expensive
*  But don't I just recommend that that's self testing is not a good idea
*  One of the best pool players in the world is a guy named shane van boning and shane is uh deaf
*  He was born deaf and when he plays he shuts his hearing aids off and he just it's a world of silence
*  And he's just playing in complete total silence
*  And when he does that when he shuts his his hearing aid off, he feels like he's got super concentration
*  Like it doesn't matter what else is going on always doing is just focusing on the balls and there's no that that sense doesn't exist
*  So he can he's hyper focused on other things
*  And I noticed that sometimes when I walk with um noise canceling
*  Headset thing it'll do similar i'll smell things more. Well, that's kind of well known
*  Is that you know different parts of your body compensate for you know, if something's you're more tuned in more tuned in like
*  Let's pay attention here
*  The the ears are offline a mountain lion can be running behind you and you're listening to fucking all things considered and that's
*  You know, but that's think about it
*  If you can't hear the mountain lion frequencies anymore and you know today's mountain lion is you know car engines all kinds of stuff
*  You can't hear it's dangerous and it's and you don't know you just slip into it I had no idea until you know
*  We have a new relationship, you know, so we've been living together for a couple years and luckily, you know
*  We're completely open and honest like hey, is this fucked up? Yeah, it's pretty cool that that exists though
*  I mean that's an elegant solution and for someone like you it actually gives you a chance to tinker with shit
*  And i'm sure i'm sure you really enjoy that aspect of it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you love that. I really do
*  I can tell it's a small thing but even when you're talking about the apps on your phone, you're so excited about that
*  Just that that whole band like okay, do you use unix or linux? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah
*  You're deep. Oh, yeah
*  Thinkpad are you a thinkpad guy? No, i'm not i'm not that deep. I actually love the
*  i'm deep
*  I'm not that deep
*  I used to be a mac guy and then mac started fucking up their usb interfaces and I got tired of it
*  And then I went to windows a lot of the top djs, you know
*  Like the danger mouse and these guys were all going windows and for audio i'm like, oh check it out
*  And you know some good devices available and so I made this transition and then I was kind of on windows. I'm like, holy fuck
*  Microsoft is spying on everything windows 10
*  This is like a hundred different telemetry pieces of shit going out every single day
*  They're just like apple by the way, they're they're advertising to you like oh use word over here and try out this
*  It's just I can't stand it. I can't stand that that you know, I have to have an account to use microsoft word
*  Right, I don't want it. It's just it's no one else's business
*  And so I bought the surface go which is 10 inch screen
*  It's a tablet but has a clip on keyboard and I just load uh lubuntu, which is a lightweight version of uh ubuntu
*  And uh, and I use that is linux. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's linux
*  Tell those people out there that don't know shit the only problem
*  Well, the only problem is that there really is no good multi-track audio solution for linux. It just
*  Please don't email me. I've been i've been following this shit for decades. It's not there. You don't know what you're talking about
*  Ah
*  You know, it's an issue with companies not wanting to do drivers and there being no platform, but that's too bad
*  So I still produce our show on windows
*  But the rest of my life is is all uh linux and my flip phone. Is that your desktop there?
*  It's just a lubuntu. I just picked it. I don't have I don't
*  It's beautiful. That's the idea. I mean, what do you use for a word processor if you don't use word libra office libra office
*  What is libra office? I sort of laugh at it. That's like before I can I just we're looking
*  We've tried to move to linux so many times, you know, I'd be like hey man, i'm gonna 10 years ago
*  I'm gonna install linux. Okay
*  Uh, it was the dry couldn't get the screen to work, you know, whatever shit it was you because i'm not you know
*  We're just hacking around and then like in the last year
*  I said i'm gonna try it again and it stuck and like it worked
*  It's good enough and and now we do like yes our official distro is linux mint 19
*  That's the one you all want to have and by the way, you know
*  Have your kid learn how to install it on some old computer. It'll teach the kid something
*  And so libra office has just been this running joke because libra means free and you know
*  Kind of like this lovey-dovey because it is it's free as in free open open source software
*  Yeah, I think I know some people get attached to that microsoft hit in terms of like office suite and all the different things but
*  Well, I just use word that's really basically all right. Well and you can save in word format
*  You know, it doesn't make any difference and I think it's just a really good
*  You know as far as like a word processing for
*  That's all I think about like with how how how well does it do the job for me?
*  It's information management and email. I uh, I use claws mail
*  And you can really customize it so I have filters and and like cording commands so I can by by doing this
*  Then it'll send back a message like hey man
*  Thanks for this and then it'll forward a copy to the back office and save it unread in the show folder
*  You know like that kind of stuff if you want to get balls deep into the world of computer technology. It's a long river
*  there's a lot of stuff to know i've been using my first computer was the
*  Sinclair zx80
*  Sinclair zx80. Yeah, and I built my own modem
*  Which was I think basically like I don't know five baud I guess
*  Um to commit it was an acoustic modem, you know, so we basically ripped open a phone
*  Put the two pieces in boxes and then put another handset on top
*  Here james got it. That's it. Yeah, that's it. Sinclair zx80, dude, and you did that at five baud
*  I remember when they switched from 14 for
*  That was way before the and then my dad always had computers around the house and I was online on
*  Um very early in that's amazing. Look at that thing. So I was hacking with that stuff
*  Wow, and then you know the trash 80
*  T you know trs 100 which was a kind of a laptop on batteries
*  Uh vic 20 commodore 64
*  So when this first started happening and you started getting going on use net and you started getting a taste of the internet like
*  My experience was aol. I got a I picked up an apple home computer from one of them office stores
*  Whatever the chain was I don't think they're around anymore
*  It was like it was actually oh comp usa. Oh, yeah, it was remember that was it was of course
*  So, uh the computer superstore. Yeah, my friend robbie used to actually make computers or sell computers for a living
*  So he was telling me what to get and I got home and I somehow another connected to aol
*  And then I remember going the first thing I did was go and try to find ufo files
*  That's all I was trying to find like what are the government's files on ufos?
*  I want to read whatever the fuck you can read. I want to you know, I want to know what they know
*  I was downloading all this shit from these like crude aol boards
*  And like these online searches where you get online search things you just archie
*  Yeah, you would get all the paperwork remember archie the search engine archie. I don't remember get archie and then you had veronica
*  They would search different types of servers. Remember gopher. Did you ever get into gopher gopher? I don't remember either
*  That was so check this out. Jamie does james
*  So gopher was basically the worldwide web only there was no web and so you could log on to a terminal
*  And you could use a menu system
*  So basically with the arrow keys
*  But you might you go to the right you might be connecting to a different computer at a different university i.e a different server
*  And then you could have a so it was basically all these
*  um
*  Information documents linking to each other and I started one I registered mtv.com
*  Which was wow and I went to him and said hey
*  I want to uh
*  I'm gonna do this thing on the internet where a lot of our audience is uh, and I want to register mtv.com. Yeah, that's cool
*  Don't worry about it. We have the aol keyword
*  So you go ahead and do your little inner thing there son do whatever you want. We have the aol
*  It's literally what this got locked up bro. We got the internet figured out
*  So I had this girl and i'm promoting it on air, you know go to mtv.com for my gopher server
*  Yeah, it was wild you could do shit then at mtv. Yeah, and uh
*  In fact at first I got an email from the university of michigan or the gophers. Is that their symbol? I don't know michigan
*  You michigan minnesota minnesota. Oh my god. Thank you
*  And they said dude you're using this commercially you have to pay us five thousand dollars for a license i'm like
*  Just for the server software, which is open, you know free but they was something in the license said i'm doing this just on my own
*  They don't give a fuck i'm just doing this
*  I don't have five thousand dollars. I really didn't know five thousand dollars said
*  If you send me a t-shirt i'll wear it on mtv
*  And I said, okay, and I said i have a document you can see that there's a video on youtube of me with the gopher t-shirt
*  On mtv and then we're like, oh man, that's cool. So anyway, then that's cool on them, too
*  So I got this set up
*  And then I got an email from this guy in
*  charpaine urbana, illinois
*  And it's like hey adam see what you're doing with mtv.com look I got this thing that i've created this mosaic browser
*  And can you install the server?
*  Httpd 1.4 or whatever
*  And that was mark andres the guy who went on to create a netscape. Wow
*  And you know, it's now one of the biggest uh vc in uh in silicon valley
*  and
*  when I saw that
*  I said, oh shit. This is like graphic like a webpage. Remember we used to
*  Images would take a long time to load. Yeah, first would be black and white progressively loading
*  It would become color like oh like a porn picture took an hour to download just like
*  Yeah, I remember the first time a friend sent me a porn video
*  He's like look at this. I was like what they can send a video. What was it?
*  Do you remember what it was a girl giving a guy a blowjob?
*  And it only lasted like 15 seconds. Of course, and that was you know, it and it took you two hours to download forever
*  Forever to download remember using it you would download from 15 different things and you get like all these different files
*  And you had a program that put it back together
*  That's crazy shit. What is this? Yeah the gopher t-shirt. Oh, there you are
*  Hey everybody
*  I want to see that I want to put the glasses on hold on. I want to see that look at you, dude
*  Oh my god, do those days the musical map keep it here. Give it here everybody
*  do those days feel like
*  Like a different human being
*  When you look back at that like that's a long ass time ago and because of the time
*  Yes, i'm sure mtv was like back then and just life back then
*  I mean, well, don't you have that yourself just with age? I mean, yeah, I mean so of course but yeah
*  Is it's all still a part of me?
*  That mtv period is so definitively closed because it's just not that will never come back. Yeah
*  I mean it was a magical time
*  It was fun and to this day
*  It can be in the oddest places
*  It's usually a guy in a suit and tie good reflexes bro. Oh that I have
*  I can catch the like people drop a a bottle. I catch it on the way down. That's my superpower
*  You get Tourette's you get a superpower
*  That's my catching stuff. It's super reflex. Sorry. Go ahead
*  usually a guy in a suit and tie and all of a sudden it's like
*  Like a
*  And the tie comes off and like it metallic a t-shirt, you know, it's hilarious
*  I love that and we share that and you know, that's a shared experience that that only
*  Only our generation has yeah, and then you know once
*  Once bet started getting the mtv had to buy bet because they were you know getting world premieres from michael jackson
*  So that was the whole thing there and you know just it got commoditized
*  They were so smart to go along they did the smarter the people who were running at the time were very smart to go with
*  Long-form programming they saw it with remote control
*  um, and of course they already had seen a little bit of it with um,
*  What's the the first reality show they had forget what's called the real world real world?
*  Yeah, so they you know, because the mtv ratings during the day were 0.5 basically
*  Uh, and I was always proud that I would sometimes break one
*  But I had interesting shows that you know people like to watch like dial mtv. That was the precursor to
*  Uh total requests live carson daily show. I so I did that
*  and you know that was
*  Just the top 10 of the day
*  But people had the idea that they were making a difference in the uh in the chart which they weren't
*  Because it was number one. Can you guess what was number one requested every single day what new kids on the block?
*  And they it was the biggest problem in mtv
*  So sometimes it just did oh they didn't make it on gee or we're not playing anything under number five today
*  Oh new kids on the block are 6g
*  Which it was
*  It was kind of bullshit kind of bullshit. Yeah
*  Didn't that come up recently with just beaver with like twitter?
*  Like when twitter trending topic trending. Yeah, like they couldn't figure out what to do. He trended so hard on twitter
*  They had to stop him from being number one
*  What they probably still would be number one better like taylor swift or biancé someone would be oh, yeah
*  Of course, of course. Well, if anyone has any idea that this is fair these these rankings and ratings. Fuck that
*  It's still weird. It's all weird because everybody's competing. Hey joe. This is really nice. Yeah, I'm having a really good time too
*  I'm really happy you're here. Yeah, it's really excited. I've always wanted to be part of kind of the pirate crew out here
*  And now I feel like i've kind of connected. I swear to god. We didn't try to be a pirate crew
*  That's what's the weirdest thing about the whole thing. There was no thought about it at all. I just kept doing it
*  There was never a plan
*  I mean, I mean as far as the plan is making this building that was kind of a plan, right?
*  Which is incredible and it's just beautiful to see I love you got a clubhouse
*  You got it's a fun club like an honest to god grown up dude clubhouse. Yeah, it feels good in this place
*  It's got good memories. It's got a good feel to it
*  But um, but through your show, you know, you've introduced and you know, I would say mainly the comedians has been the best
*  Um, just and thank god for netflix and all this stuff that's happening. It's just this is kind of the nucleus of it all
*  Yeah, and and and it's uh, it's a lot
*  It's interesting to be able to see and watch and this I think comedians change the world when
*  When they're good at it and when they care and i'm seeing more and more of it and I like it, you know
*  Maybe time for a little bit of pushback here and there. Yeah, it's I think what it is is
*  we have a place
*  Where comedians can go and give you
*  like
*  From them to you for the first time and it's never really like the most you ever had was like a moment
*  If you're a talk show host where you can address the camera, I remember there's a really powerful moment when um,
*  uh
*  What's what's his name? The english guy that just craig? Uh
*  craig daniels craig
*  Craig fergerson. Thank you. Sorry. He's not english. Is he is he irish?
*  Scottish sorry craig. I like him a lot
*  But he had this moment where he's talking about britney spears where he like looked at the camera and he said
*  It was about her being crazy like when she shaved her head and like what are you doing?
*  What are we doing? Like why following this girl? This poor girl is losing her mind. Yeah, like how near alone hounding her leave her alone
*  Yeah, and that really is what it is
*  Is like once someone like that becomes a topic and it's a subject that they can get clicks on and views and and ratings
*  They'll just hound that poor girl
*  A comedian a comedian got bill cosby in jail. Yeah, that's right
*  Yeah, that's right hannibal
*  Yeah, it's um
*  Talk about being canceled. I know it's next level canceled. Yeah, and he deserves that man deserved every minute of it
*  It's very strange, right? He's the strangest of all of them when I was a kid
*  We would listen to his uh album where he uh, he talked about god talking to noah the conversation between god noah
*  It's hilarious
*  Hilarious work it was great great comedy. It's hard to imagine that the whole time he was doing that
*  Spooky it's hard to imagine how i'm going to drive back to the airport in a straight line
*  Like a wizard dude, you have no problem you can hang out here for a while too and so good
*  Good
*  You could go work out
*  As a gym turn the music on it hurts. It's hurt. How about that sauna though? I like that
*  Oh, you can do in the sauna. Sure. I'll set that up. No, that's great, man
*  Yeah, do you sauna at all? No, I love I have I um used to have a place in Amsterdam
*  I had a place with a sauna in the house. That was nice
*  It's so undeniably good for you if you do it all the time, but then i'd be smoking weed in the sauna
*  Oh, don't do that. Yeah, it was very you could smoke weed and then get in there
*  That's not a problem
*  That's probably good
*  Yeah, I liked it a lot. It's good experience. Have you done the float tank? I did that once I did not like that at all
*  Claustrophobic no, no, I just was so I couldn't I couldn't get into any kind of zone or vibe
*  I just kept like i'm laying here in lukewarm water
*  I'm like i'm not hearing anything. It's like no am I thinking am I liking this? It's getting a little colder
*  No, it's getting warmer. So I couldn't I couldn't well that is a real issue
*  If it's not temperature control correctly and you feel cold, it'll fuck up your your experience
*  You really want it in that perfect sweet zone
*  But when you can get there it's really all about whether or not, you know how to concentrate on breathing
*  If you can just concentrate on breathing i've done breath work. Yeah, it was very interesting
*  It's not not a difficult formula that I employ
*  But I'll tell you guys if you listen if you also float
*  When I get in there I touch the sides to center myself so that I don't bounce against anything and distract myself
*  Because i'm floating, you know and you drift into the wall sometimes
*  So I wait until the ripples die down because when you climb in there's going to be like a little bit of ripplage
*  Right and then when you lay down once the water gets still then I let my hands go
*  And then I just think about breathing and I thought i'm not a wizard at this right it goes in and out
*  I think about ah, I forgot to call that guy. Oh, I gotta send that email
*  Oh, I gotta I gotta book. I gotta put that on my calendar. I keep forgetting
*  And then if I just stay vigilant and make sure I okay
*  Okay
*  Get back on the road and the bet the road is thinking only of the breathing only of the in
*  And out and the in and out
*  I just I visualize air coming in and out of my lungs and just that alone while lying in the tank would put me in a trance
*  And it takes a while but I can do it quicker because i've done it for years because it's like the tank's a normal thing
*  I get in i'm like, ah the most I always think is I should do this more often
*  That's what I usually think but I can get in a trance by just thinking about the breathing
*  Yeah, tina and I did a breathwork clinic. I forget what it was called, but you do
*  It was like this tribal beat and you had to continue to breathe to the beat and wait
*  And you have one person will be watching you and then you team up and we didn't team up together
*  But it's just like that and this beat is going and then you do the breathwork and then all of a sudden you go
*  Into a trance and it's different for everybody and I I could fly and that was my and for just like 30 minutes
*  I'm just flying and yet right after you had to draw
*  What you were doing?
*  You know, I mean it's one of these like yeah, i'm a little i'm a little hippie too. I like this stuff. It's good
*  So you draw it and then I just drew it as I was flying. I was like but like this
*  One of these like a jetpack man kind of yeah like iron man, but but I could just because i'm a pilot so I knew
*  How sure yeah, I was like, oh fuck. This is all I need
*  And you know people had different experiences one woman who I was partnered with her turn
*  And she just and they had told me that she could get a little funky
*  And she just kind of got out of it and picked up a plastic bat next to her which I had seen
*  She starts hammering the pillow like really
*  Oh my god, and it's just you know, but fantastic you come out of it. You're like wow
*  I mean that was just such a great experience. I bet that bitch does that shit at starbucks, too
*  I bet she's just wild just looking for excuses. She goes to the yoga class starts punching the walls
*  this pose
*  Maybe
*  maybe
*  So but you know tank but holotropic breathing. I think they call that that's probably what it was
*  Yeah, I mean, I know that is one of them
*  I don't know maybe there's other methods that they do it
*  But the people that do it say it gets you high as fuck see if we were live then tina would text me now
*  He's like
*  She knows all that shit. I think
*  Aubrey's done that shit. I think it's holotropic breathing, right?
*  Is that the only psychedelic breathe there is a for sure a method that people you can do so much with your breathing
*  You can do all kinds of crazy things
*  I mean have you ever done you seen those yoga dudes who can suck their stomach in and do that?
*  That little yeah is it thing where their stomach goes in yeah the side and I don't find it particularly attractive
*  It's it's very impressive
*  Yeah, I'm like
*  I've never really understood it. Like what do you do? I didn't know it was an exercise
*  I just thought it was showing off
*  I don't know what the fuck they're doing because even though it's it's impressive. I've never attempted it
*  It's one of those things where I look at I go. Yeah, look at that like yeah
*  It's impressive but but to someone who can actually do that. Is it a thing? Is it like that?
*  I don't know what they're doing. I have no idea but there was this uh, famous jujitsu guy named Hicks and Gracie and he was famous for it
*  He was one of the first guys to incorporate yoga into martial arts like really seriously and it's the greatest Gracie of all time
*  Right and he would lay there. There's this uh, there's this uh video from this movie choke where he's sitting there
*  Um in a lotus position and he's doing this crazy shit with his stomach. I can't even believe it's real
*  Watch this. Look at this. Watch this
*  This is Hicks and when you do this like this intense breathing, but then
*  See, he would move his stomach or this is from the movie choke, but watch what he could do with his stomach
*  Whoa. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Look. Yeah
*  Look at this crazy shit where he could pull it to the left and to the right. He has like ultimate control over his breath
*  and that
*  Strength and control over his breath from all these breathing exercises that he did
*  was a big part of
*  Like how he could fight and how he could how his jujitsu was so strong. He had incredible breath control
*  He had incredible body control when you say why his jujitsu was so strong. What does that mean exactly?
*  He was what the most dominant of the most dominant family in his fighting skills in jujitsu
*  Okay, he's a legend like a legit like there's there's very few universal legends
*  I should come during one of your like fighter talk things. I would learn a lot. Yeah, it's it's interesting
*  This guy's one of the most interesting
*  He's one of the most interesting because his family in brazil was famous
*  For creating this form of jujitsu brazilian jujitsu that went on to win the ultimate fighting championship and really
*  Revolutionized martial arts, right?
*  But he was the champion of the family and not just by a small margin
*  By a large universally agreed upon margin where all of them would go hickson's the king like no one's even close
*  Everyone says that he would go and he would get some of the best black belts in the world
*  Like a hundred of them in a room and he would just one after the other tap them out one after the other
*  He's still fighting. He's an older man now and you know
*  He's teaches and he I know he still trains and he's involved in these big seminars because his opinion is very very respected
*  Because it was an intense level of jujitsu that he was able to achieve but he literally had peaked
*  He hit past everyone. He figured something out to get way above everyone
*  And I think that had a lot to do with it. I think the yoga and the mindset sure meditation
*  His mind was strong and then because of the yoga
*  His body was really flexible and really like well conditioning can contort in these amazing ways to achieve submissions
*  And then also his jujitsu was so sharp like his family created it and like everything was polished everyone knew
*  Everything that the correct defense the correct offense where you never make mistakes. You can't be in this position
*  Always be here abandon that and go to this you have planned b c d
*  And you keep going with him true master. He's running like running these trains of techniques on people
*  It's special to watch anyone else like him. There's a bunch of guys now
*  There's a bunch of fucking assassins now, but in his day
*  He was just there's no one person that stands out above like everyone. This is kid gordon ryan
*  Who's this really elite submission artist who taps everybody in competition and he's trained
*  What i'm sorry, what does submission artist mean? Well, there's uh, jujitsu with a gi right with which is just
*  Uh, you know jujitsu rules. They vary depending upon the organization
*  But you wear the gi and you can use the gi you can choke people the gi is your dress
*  Your yes the white the white kimono or the blue one or people have multi-color the guy from the commercial says no
*  This is my business gi
*  Yeah, right
*  Um, but even a jacket, you know, like you're using clothes, right?
*  The idea is like if you got in a fight with someone who's yes exactly
*  It actually comes from part of judo called niwaza, which is the ground. I did a little judo as a kid
*  Very little jujitsu came out of judo judo was the original in japanese jujitsu
*  And then it became brazilian jujitsu when the brazilians legitimate it changed it and altered it and then there's submission grappling submission grappling
*  There's no gi so most of the time guys wear like rash guards like skin tight like surfer rash guards those kind of yeah
*  Okay, or you know or skin tight shorts can't really can't really hold on to it exactly the ideas you can you can't grab clothes
*  It's just about it's like wrestling
*  But it's wrestling with chokes and arm bars and okay in that world is a guy named gordon ryan
*  Who's a real prodigy and his uh his trainer is considered to be one of the all-time great trainers
*  His name is john donahur and they come from henzel gracy's academy in new york city, which is one of the greatest jujitsu schools
*  Like universally recognized ever and it's this giant gym in manhattan that is it just
*  So many killers have come out of this one place
*  So that kid is probably the top of the food chain today out of everybody but even his dominance
*  Is probably slightly different from hickson's because hickson
*  What was there was no losses there was no draws?
*  There was like it was just dominating people just everyone got dominated and everybody came out of it going what the fuck
*  He just ran through everybody. Well, how did it end for him? What was his last hickson? Did you have a big exit?
*  No, well, you had a giant fight against this very dangerous guy in japan in 2000 and that was an mma fight
*  And he beat his ass and so that's a nice exit. That's nice. He won out on top
*  Nobody ever beat him in a mixed martial arts fight
*  He really didn't fight a lot of the there was a lot of opportunities for different people
*  That he could have fought but he just didn't want to didn't feel like it. He's just a free spirit
*  But um
*  My point. I don't know what the fuck my point. Well, here's a question the stomach thing. Do you that's what it was
*  Do you think that's where it was? Do you think it's a gene?
*  Or is it the environment?
*  that I have
*  absolutely
*  No interest
*  In fighting of any kind. I don't watch it. I'm not I saw the thrill at manila
*  My dad got me up in the middle of the night. We were living overseas to see it
*  And I thought I appreciated that as a as a world event. Yeah
*  um
*  It's just never i've what is it? I'm
*  Some people like I just don't I don't understand it. I don't like it
*  I think it's cool that you don't understand it. I think understand is probably the there's nothing in me that says
*  Oh, yeah, I want to see that guy beat the other guy's ass. Yeah, that's that should be
*  Perfect, you know in in a perfect world. Everybody should be like that
*  Okay, well like legitimately I respect it I like where you're coming from
*  I just never go i'm fascinated. I'm very interested as I said, I did a little judo
*  Um that was mainly because I was getting picked on at school. My dad said here
*  Yeah, going to judo and so I learned how to you know fall and how to
*  We dive over like five kids and then roll and then get up again
*  And after that got kind of a little I didn't like it, you know, like just I don't know
*  I didn't like and then went fencing. I was actually very good at fencing
*  I like that a lot martial arts for competition. It's a it's a strange pursuit
*  And professionally for competition, it's an even stranger pursuit
*  Like originally the martial artist gets into martial arts because they want to better themselves
*  They want to be better at fighting they want to have confidence. They want to be able to defend themselves
*  But just like you want guns to be able to defend yourself
*  There's a lot of people that want to learn how to physically defend themselves against another man
*  Right, right. I've always said this like people say like why do you do it? Why do you work out and what I mean?
*  first health and sanity
*  First oh but second very important
*  I want to be the one who decides if we're in an altercation and you decide you're some bully
*  And you run up on me and you think you're just gonna hit me
*  I want to be the one who decides who goes to the hospital not you
*  I don't want your mercy. I think I grew up so sheltered. I never was really ever threatened really anyway
*  Every day
*  All around the world it happens to somebody and if you're lucky you live your whole life by going into the right places
*  And never get punched and never never gets
*  Just stole on where somebody just comes up to you and just starts smacking you around
*  You can't defend yourself because it fucking happens. Yeah, people do it to people and people are awful
*  Yeah, you know and you but most people are not the vast majority are not but
*  You know you do that shit the the wrong guy like and you don't you didn't know better and you you did that to boss
*  Rutan who was a former ufc heavyweight champion is one of the nicest guys ever you might get confused and think
*  Like god, you don't know maybe who he is. Maybe you think you're gonna bully him
*  Maybe you think you're gonna fuck with him make him uncomfortable and next thing you know, you're waking up in the hospital
*  I think i'm as i'm just reflecting here. I have a childhood memory would make which may be where this started for me
*  Uh, I remember and I went I entered dutch school in fifth grade speaking almost no dutch
*  It was kind of a fucked up situation
*  So let's say around sixth grade and I was learning a little bit on the street and around but I definitely was not
*  Not really 100% fluent and I can't remember what it was is in the it was in the gym in the locker room
*  And some kid something said something and he was much smaller than I was and I said something like well
*  I can take care of you little man
*  And it probably I shouldn't have said it in the first place
*  But within like a nanosecond
*  And i'm like, you know, he's put me down, you know hit me in the on the nose
*  And yeah, and i'm like
*  Oh, fuck me
*  I and that I think that was the moment where i'm like
*  I should definitely be careful what I say and to who I say and I should watch my mouth
*  Um, but maybe that skewed me from right there from that moment. Oh for sure. That's yeah for sure
*  That was yeah. Yeah, so it's like, oh, how old are you 12 something like that? Oh man for sure
*  Yeah, that's gonna leave a stain in your consciousness. Oh, thank you for bringing this up. No, listen
*  Like therapy here is great, right?
*  I mean, I think everybody needs to know why things bother them why things like conflict bother them
*  Does this has I don't know as i'm you're 50 52
*  Really? Yeah, so almost we're same age basically. Um
*  Do you have more of those moments now that you think?
*  Oh shit
*  That's that's what happened then and that's why i'm having those which mean what where just
*  You're doing something and you think back to a moment like I just had here. Hey that happened
*  Maybe that does influence me now today how I respond to a certain situation
*  Yeah, i'm having more of those and my wife is having that too. That's smart. I like it a lot
*  It's very interesting. I think oh god if I only known this
*  20 years ago. Yeah, the origin of your behavior is an interesting thing the origin of your ideas. Yeah, and where you are now
*  you know, um, it's a
*  You know, we're just the way we choose to behave about things. It's very strange but
*  Anybody doing something like that to you when you're that age must have been an insanely traumatic experience
*  You wouldn't want to watch I didn't even tell my parents about it. I didn't tell my parents about it. Yeah, I was so ashamed
*  Yeah, yeah, that's hard. Yeah
*  The the solution to that as strange as it sounds is everybody know how to fight
*  You get into way less fights if it sounds crazy. It's right on. I think there you go. It's taught
*  I think it should be taught just for peace. Whereas we seem to be going kind of the opposite direction. Um with uh, with a general
*  Cultural education of young men at least yes in the united states. I don't know if it's the same everywhere
*  I think it may be kind of
*  Propagating out there some of the nicest people I know are martial arts people
*  Of course because they have their ego in a good place in comparison to the general population
*  They've been humbled in training everybody gets humbled in training. It's so good for you
*  It really is and it leaves you calm
*  Like you get exercise in and you get some sort of a weird therapy too for when you're a man and just knowing that you
*  Aren't you you aren't helpless?
*  I've seen people that are helpless. It's very sad. I think it comes from anything you learn
*  Um like learning how to fly
*  Yeah, you're literally helpless if you're doing it wrong and an instructor a good instructor will you know help you get into situations that
*  You have to get out of and that same feeling arrives. I think that that's a part of just the learning process
*  Yeah, um, I should probably try it
*  You'd love it. Yeah, what should I try? What would the well tina tina's laughing her ass off like?
*  Oh, yeah
*  Oh, yeah, here we go after this and i'll find a good spot
*  We could go and learn and just you would get a kick out of just the learning just like you get a kick out of learning
*  The dancing. Yeah, exactly. Especially like if you take something like muay thai muay thai is really fun
*  I saw I was I did documentary in thailand. Oh, did you really?
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah, I love the the rhythm of the music and it's all cute clued into how they do their shit
*  Yeah, I went up to the burmese border the golden triangle stayed with the hill tribe. Whoa. I've done a lot of crazy
*  Stuff documentaries. What is that? How can someone watch that?
*  It's called veronica goes and veronica was the the organization that I worked for in the netherlands broadcast company
*  Um, is it available online? Can someone find you can probably bits of it on youtube veronica goes asia and so it was thailand
*  I mean we did a number of things we went into
*  Uh brothel, you know where the girls have all the numbers and we filmed there
*  um, I
*  Oh man, i'm going to the long necks, you know where they have all the rings on
*  And I was thinking oh, this is going to be great
*  We're going to see the long necks four and a half hours and the first you get from shang mai to shangrai up in the north
*  Then a four and a half hour five hour bus drive because we said cruise right so we're 10 people with producers and everything
*  And it's like it's got to be around here and it's like a big sign almost a neon long necks this way
*  I'm like fucking tourist trap. It really is, you know, but then we
*  Went up to the hill tribe
*  Uh, i'm sure that they've done it before you know had crews over but it's only women because all the men are in the opium
*  Hut and just completely stone smoking opium the women run the whole deal
*  and uh, and they they chew the
*  Beetle nut root with uh with a white paste in it some kind of cocoa paste
*  And so of course for the documentary I tried that you know, and their mouths are all red your teeth get completely red from the beetle nut
*  Oh my god, and I was like, oh shit, you know, it's like like an elevator
*  You know dmt can be a little bit of an elevator vibe. She's like
*  Um
*  You know
*  It's it's stay with me for a good 45 minutes. What's the sensation like um
*  A bit dmt, but very very light version of it, you know, so it's a psychedelic. I guess so
*  I just just you felt this like, you know, it felt kind of clear, you know like oh this is kind of interesting
*  But all right. I'm pretty high. Just I don't know. I haven't done a lot of different drugs
*  so I'm not quite sure. It was interesting, but I don't like the red teeth. It's kind of awkward
*  socially. Yeah, it's a turn off. People know you're a... What is it? What's the name of the thing?
*  The Beetle Root Nut. Beetle Root Nut. And Cocoa Paste. Call on someone.
*  Probably Coke and some red stuff. Yeah. Who the hell knows what it is?
*  Beetle Nut Root. What's in that jazz, Jamie? Can we find out?
*  You gotta see the women. You gotta see their red... What of me?
*  I think so. It's Veronica Goes America Asia in Caribbean. It's like 11. I clip on YouTube.
*  Oh yeah. It's got you eating the Beetle Root. So then we also had to drink Cobra Blood,
*  you know, all this stuff. Yeah, it's kind of sad because first they piss the Cobra off,
*  and they get the venom. And this is in the restaurant. They get the venom out of his
*  sacks, and then they slit them open and bleed it into a glass of alcohol. And it's supposed to be
*  very potent. Is that me? That's not you, but that's...
*  No, but this guy's got the teeth of someone who eats that. He looks very happy.
*  Look at that guy to the far right. Anyway. Look at that one. Who the hell knows what it is?
*  That's a lady. Look at her. Tripping balls. Happy as fuck.
*  Anyway, but we also shot a lot of Muay Thai. So we went to the small village fights.
*  This makeshift ring in the middle of the jungle and all these people, and then the music...
*  And just... That would be something that would be good for you to learn.
*  Magical. You would enjoy it, I think.
*  A lot of twisty and kicky stuff. Yeah. Twisty and kicky stuff that would compliment...
*  You know how to dance and move your legs around.
*  Oh, I'm an excellent dancer. I bet you are. I've heard you took lessons.
*  It'd be a fun thing to learn. It was actually my wedding video. So we got married in May.
*  And these days, everyone has an iPhone, so there's just video everywhere.
*  And I look at myself dancing, I'm like, oh my God, this has to stop. This video has to be
*  eliminated. I am actually that guy. I'm so bad. And so I said, let's at least learn to dance some
*  proper dances together, because then I can keep my posture up, my frame. And then it just became,
*  hey, this is kind of fun. We enjoy doing this with each other. Yeah. Some people go golfing.
*  Maybe we'll go dancing. If you watch old Fred Astaire movies, real dancing is very impressive.
*  Oh my God. I love it. I love it.
*  Here's a strange thing. Okay, how did that get associated with homosexuality?
*  Broadway. And I love Broadway musicals. And I think that's where it became associated.
*  Because a lot of gay guys are in Broadway and they did the musical.
*  But if you think about those Fred Astaire type days, like then...
*  Manly men were doing that. Yeah, that was a really manly man thing.
*  Gentlemen who could strut and they danced around.
*  Remember what I told you? Look at this.
*  And of course, we always say Fred Astaire was great, but Ginger Rogers did everything
*  backwards in heels. So...
*  Right. True, right?
*  Don't underestimate...
*  He's wearing heels too.
*  Yeah, dance heels. I think they're tap heels.
*  Yeah. Her heels are bullshit though.
*  But you're right.
*  At least women back then didn't have stilettos.
*  The days of the crooners, Sinatra and the Rat Pack.
*  It must be such a pain in the ass.
*  And when we could call women broads and dames.
*  Some chicks still like that.
*  Yeah.
*  Who's the asshole that made women wear those fucking shoes?
*  Who's the first person that figured out stilettos and high heels?
*  Well, you know why they're worn.
*  I mean, the initial idea is to...
*  Because of the angle and the pressure, your calves pump up and that is deemed as more
*  sexually attractive. In fact, I think it's pretty proven to work on men's attraction to women.
*  Red lipstick is also part of the blush you have after orgasm, blush on your cheeks,
*  all that stuff is sexual and it's just exploited by a huge industry.
*  Yeah, for sure. It's just where they talk that checks into it.
*  The heel thing especially, imagine if men were all...
*  I love it. Don't you love it? Don't you think it looks fantastic?
*  I think it looks fantastic. I do. But imagine if it went the other way.
*  And if men were the ones who somehow or another by our culture were tricked into wearing stilettos
*  and the higher the heel, the cooler you looked, the cuter you looked at the club.
*  We have entire swaths of men tricked into putting a noose around their neck every
*  single morning with all kinds of weird shit. At least that kind of looks cool.
*  It's a noose. It is a noose.
*  It's a noose. Listen, you're coming from someone who said,
*  I wouldn't wear one because I know if I got a hold of someone's tie, I could choke them to death
*  with it. Exactly.
*  Yeah, especially if it's like a sticky tie. And if it's a winds or not, that's best.
*  Leather ties, that shit's preposterous. What kind of tie?
*  A leather tie. You have a strap around... You literally have a strap around your neck.
*  The murder weapon is right there. You have a belt around your neck.
*  And it's also uncomfortable. Yeah.
*  It does look cool. Something about it makes it look like you're fucking serious.
*  Men get pushed into all kinds of things with commercialism, but that's cool.
*  If you listen to someone who really cherishes a good suit talk about it, then you kind of get it.
*  They're in love.
*  Yes. Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's nice.
*  Yeah. Some things.
*  Some people are really into suits. They look at it like an art form.
*  Well, yeah. Guy Ritchie, he had a whole thing. He was telling me about it. He came in with a
*  beautiful suit on. And I was like, look at that fucking suit, man. I told him about the tie thing
*  and he just shook his head. He's a black belt in jiu-jitsu too, though.
*  Okay. He didn't...
*  He also makes no sense to do that.
*  Well, it does make sense, but he's like, you're not grabbing my tie.
*  No, not going to happen.
*  He's actually a black belt from Henzo Gracie. That guy we were talking about earlier.
*  Yeah, but Guy Ritchie loves suits. But the way he talks about it, you love suits too. You're like,
*  ah, I get it. The way someone talks about a really well-made, handmade shoe that you got from some
*  Italian cobbler and you're like, oh, I get it. You're wearing a piece of art. This is someone's
*  art. Yes, it is a boot, but it is also, when you see that thing, it reminds you of Italy. It reminds
*  you of a guy who actually made this. There's something fucking cool about that that we're
*  definitely getting away from. Someone who can make a watch. If someone makes a watch, they're taking
*  all these things and putting wheels in there. Or you could just get like a fucking G-Shock.
*  I've had this watch longer than my daughter's been alive. 30 years.
*  It's amazing.
*  I've tried other watches, but it's a piece of me now.
*  Is it a Rolex?
*  Yeah.
*  It's beautiful.
*  I bought it back in the old MTV music business days. If you were a douchebag,
*  then you had a diamond bezel around it. And now this is actually very popular amongst rich women.
*  They're like a thick watch.
*  I go to my former New York banker friend. I go to his dinner party and it's like,
*  oh man, it's like three women here wearing my watch. It's like,
*  still looks great.
*  I love it. It's such a classic, but the gold just kind of melts into me now and it's a part of me.
*  And it's a reminder of a different time. When this shit mattered, now I really don't care.
*  But it's beautiful. It's a cool thing. It's got a lot of sentimentality, right?
*  Yeah.
*  If you go back to the origin of wristwatches, it's amazing how long they've been around.
*  Pocket watches.
*  These motherfuckers figured out how to do that shit hundreds of years ago.
*  They figured out, when did they figure out a pocket watch? Like what was the year?
*  Because that was the first one. You get it on a chain, you pull it up and I guess you had to wind
*  it. But the fact that it works, like they put a bunch of fucking gears together in this thing that
*  you carried around everywhere and it kept time.
*  When both my grandparents died, they died very close to each other.
*  16th century. Holy shit.
*  Is that a Hamilton?
*  1510. In Nuremberg, Germany.
*  It's a Peter Henlein. He created the first pocket watch in 1510.
*  According to Wikipedia.
*  The Italians were producing clocks small enough to be worn on the person by the earliest 16th century.
*  That'd be weird wearing like a necklace clock.
*  Like play the play.
*  Yeah, I guess.
*  It should be just like play the play.
*  That guy is 60 years old and he's still wearing the clock around his neck.
*  Once you know what time it is.
*  I remember those guys back in MTDN. They were nuts there in the street jumping around,
*  flavor-flavored, just doing his thing with the clock. Like, wow, man, that's still your gig.
*  You were talking about Mark Wahlberg the other day and I did the tour with him.
*  I had a syndicated radio show and the stations would put it on if I came and did their summer jam.
*  Summer jam.
*  B-59 all summer long. MTV's Adam Curry.
*  And then they had Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, Sisters with Voices.
*  Sometimes UB 40. That would be cool if they were there.
*  So every weekend I go off to some bad top 40 radio station around the country.
*  And that was what Greg Lawley put together, my buddy in Austin. He and I did that.
*  And he was promoting all the artists. And so Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch.
*  He was just like you said, Calvin Klein underwear model, cool guy, nice. He seemed to be calm.
*  Didn't cause a ruckus on the road or anything. And we stayed at some pretty shitty places.
*  And all of a sudden he's like, Mr. Hollywood and doing well at it. I like it.
*  And never stopped.
*  No.
*  Like you started doing well in like, what, in the 80s?
*  Yeah. It's like Will Smith. We invented himself too.
*  We did Sega Genesis launch parties together.
*  Yeah. He's another one.
*  And he was doing Parents Just Don't Understand.
*  Yeah. I know, right?
*  It was great. Yeah. Amazing.
*  That's him. How old was he then?
*  I don't know.
*  Ah, he looks like a kid.
*  16.
*  No, wasn't he? Yeah, 18. Maybe he was 17.
*  Anyway, he's been around forever.
*  Yeah.
*  And still doing, I mean, the fact that he was able to reinvent himself too as a major movie star too.
*  Yeah.
*  Amazing.
*  Fantastic. Good stories.
*  Yeah. When you remembered the birth of the internet, when you remember first getting on
*  and seeing the expansion, was there ever a moment, when was the moment, I should say?
*  Obviously now, today, we all realize it's out of control and it's just wild.
*  It's a very strange thing that's taking over our lives.
*  And then I want to talk about Neuralink too. I'm sure you know something about that.
*  About Elon Musk's invention, Neuralink.
*  I know a little bit about it.
*  But when you saw it kind of getting away, like when was the moment or where you were like,
*  this is a very strange thing that's never happened to people before.
*  Well, I had the online part figured out because I ran a bulletin board.
*  You might remember those. You could call in, maybe like five lines and you go in and do
*  your business and then get out.
*  What year was that?
*  Oh, this has got to be early 80s. No, maybe even late 70s.
*  So there's time for innovation there, right? There's big,
*  long stretches where things don't get any better.
*  Well, the speeds got marginally better. People got more phone lines.
*  The computers were able to do more.
*  Then there were also some other things happening.
*  We had Windows. Windows 95 came into play.
*  So now people were in a different world of computing.
*  It used to be DOS and people have WordPerfect and then all of a sudden,
*  we have an interface on top of it.
*  We didn't have that.
*  So that started to teach people how to deal with the environment.
*  So that was all there, but the internet itself would be 1987.
*  To get on the internet, you had to log in to a dial-up account, launch a PPP session or slip,
*  and then you had to launch the software on your computer.
*  And then you could open a terminal and you could type things like telnet and then a domain name
*  or even an IP address. You could connect to someone else's thing and kind of look around.
*  It was just all text-based. But that for me was like, holy shit, you can connect from one to the
*  next. I understood the hyperlinking. I understood how powerful that would be.
*  And if I just had a little computer today on my desk, I had a Mac Plus with a gigantic external
*  20 megabytes SCSI hard drive, 20 megabytes. That's an empty Word doc.
*  So that big thing like that. I just was like, oh my God, this is going to be it.
*  So the second moment was Andreessen with his HTTP Demosaic browser, the web.
*  And then the third moment was Carl Jacob. He's an investor, maybe even on the board at Facebook,
*  but he worked at Sun Microsystems at the time. And he contacted me and said,
*  okay, I see what you're doing. I'm going to send you a computer. He sent me a Sun Voyager,
*  which is like a portable, a luggable with an LCD color screen. This is now 88, something like that.
*  Unix, which is even crazier. And so he started to show me stuff and he actually
*  streamed a song from his workstation in San Francisco to my computer in
*  Montclair, New Jersey. And it played. I had him on the phone here. I heard him start it.
*  And then it came through and it played on my computer. I'd never seen this before or heard it.
*  I was like, oh fuck, broadcast. We can use this to broadcast. And since that moment,
*  I think that's the mission I've been on. And look at, mama, I have arrived. Here we are.
*  That's an amazing story, man. That's cool as fuck. I love hearing it from someone who was there from
*  the very first steps. And we used to have the yellow pages, the internet yellow pages,
*  which was a book. I still have it. It was published. It was published. You can look up everything in the
*  yellow pages. That was a business. That was a business. But yellow pages got fucked, right?
*  Of course. That shit fell apart. Here's what happened with newspapers. Here's where the
*  newspapers fucked up with the news when the internet came around. And there were, I saw it.
*  Other people saw it. Craig Newmark saw it. And it's classified because they were all hoity-toity
*  about the advertising model. But they were really making the money off the classified ads. Everybody
*  knows it. Everybody knew it. And that's what Craigslist, who tried to sell it to Tribune,
*  was it Tribune or Hearst? Maybe it was Hearst, for just a couple million bucks. And it's like,
*  no, we're not interested. We don't need it. Not invented here or whatever. And so he ate up their
*  classified business overnight. And they were left holding the bag saying, well, we have cool news
*  to advertise on. Well, no, no, no. We'll put some in there. But now it was about the classifieds.
*  That's where the money came from. Wow. Dvorak can tell the story. I'll ask him to do it on the show.
*  That makes sense. You can tell the story about Craig Newmark and how they passed on it. And he
*  does that very well. The classified ads, do they even have them still in the newspapers?
*  Oh, bits. Dead People is still a good business. Of course, they have some, but no, not really.
*  How often do you hold a physical newspaper in your hand and read it?
*  Whenever I'm at the airport, I always buy the newspapers. Because I don't want to be on my
*  phone. Let me just read the newspaper. Do you use Android?
*  No. iPhone?
*  I have a stripped down, I call it cloaked, no SIM card, VPN, pie hole. There's a lot of different
*  parts on it that I do carry. It's iPhone 7 if I need to. There's no other apps on it, no extra
*  apps. Just blanket. So you keep that in case of emergency? Yeah, if I need to do something.
*  Yeah. I want to use the GPS. It also has an iCloud account that's not my main iCloud account.
*  I'm trying to make that Adam Curry and remove my other digital footprint.
*  I get it.
*  Try to move it over a little bit or something, at least confuse it a bit.
*  Wow. Whatever happened to it? Wasn't there a blockchain phone that was going to be released?
*  There's a number of interesting projects that are Linux based.
*  I'm trying to think of the one that's on the... A lot of it's crowdfunded. This company actually,
*  they make laptops that are complete. They do all open source hardware.
*  Shit, Jamie, can you find... What's the name of that country? I feel stupid now. It's the weed.
*  It definitely is the weed.
*  But they crowdfund, but they've had very successful crowdfunding with Linux laptops,
*  with open source hardware. That's really where you have to look for the problems.
*  Because advertising, it's an insatiable thing that these companies are hooked on.
*  They have to keep getting data from us. That's the system. So when we start to cut it down,
*  they move to the hardware, they move to different types of ways of getting data.
*  You still can't hide from cell phone triangulation. There's all kinds of ways people
*  can find you. That's really the biggest problem. If you can track someone's location,
*  you can build their life. Add a credit card to that.
*  Mimi, John C. Dvorak's wife, she does the company's taxes. It's a very family business.
*  I think she used to do some kind of auditing in the past. She'll call up and say,
*  here's what I always see you do. She'll tell me exactly what I do, where I go,
*  when I like to eat out. She has all these patterns. She just does it for fun.
*  Do you have GPS on your car?
*  You can't get rid of it. No manufacturer after probably 2015 allows you to completely turn off
*  tracking. Well, you got an iPhone 7. Why don't you get like a 69 Corvette?
*  But that's the point. Everything is built in.
*  I think that didn't really start until the 2000s.
*  Well, they sold it to us in a great way with OnCall. Boom, I'm upside down. OnCall,
*  help is on the way. What is this, Jamie?
*  I typed in- Librem. There you go. Thank you. What did you type in?
*  Crowdfunded Linux laptop. Fantastic. Yeah, Librem.
*  Purism company. They make a bunch of products. Do you mean laptop or phone?
*  They make both. They make the laptops, the phone,
*  their company. But there's other projects as well.
*  It looks like a real phone. But here's my problem. Here's my problem.
*  What? It's still going to bleep and bloop.
*  Right. I don't want it.
*  Right. It's going to find you. I'll buy it. Of course, I want to have it because I have
*  control over keeping it off and not using it when I'm on the road. But as a basic thing,
*  if I'm at home and I just want to surf, I'm sitting down. Yeah, I'd rather use that.
*  Absolutely. Apple, I kind of trust Apple to a degree. They're pretty good about not selling
*  stuff they know. So their maps would be what I use. I trust that. But only as far as I can throw
*  them. I'm sure there's a million guys going, Curry, you have no idea how they try. Yeah, I do.
*  So I just try to make less data. What do you think happened with Google that they removed
*  Don't Be Evil? I think it was Do No Evil.
*  Do No Evil. That's right. People get that wrong.
*  I get everything wrong.
*  Which is even. No, I mean, it's one of those things that it's like a Mandela Effect.
*  Okay, right. Like the Bernstein Bears.
*  Yeah, exactly. So it's like Mandela Effect. But for whatever reason, well, that's a...
*  Okay, so these guys who grew up under the...
*  Don't Be Evil.
*  I thought it was Don't Do Evil. But it was in the S1 document and I remember reading it.
*  Okay.
*  Okay, I could be wrong.
*  So it is either way.
*  Maybe they changed that halfway and went from Don't Be Evil to Don't Do Evil to Don't Be Evil.
*  They adjusted it from Do The Right Thing.
*  That's what it says now, I guess.
*  Oh, either way.
*  Anyway.
*  Whatever the wording of it is.
*  So these guys didn't grow up by accident. This is gonna be my big Google conspiracy theory.
*  I'll give it to you. It's one way of explaining it. Maybe I'm full of shit.
*  Okay. I love a good conspiracy theory.
*  They had a lot of help.
*  I'll tell you in advance. I'm rooting on this conspiracy.
*  Their main boost was the acquisition of Keyhole.
*  You have to know that the company Incutel, which is a venture capital company, which is the CIA's...
*  It's not a secret. It's the CIA's... They would say, our CIA venture capital company.
*  And they invest in stuff. And they helped the Keyhole acquisition. And Keyhole is the mapping.
*  That's really what Google Maps was. The most important thing you can have for persons identity
*  is where they are. These guys kind of grew up young under oppression of Russia. That's where
*  they both come from. And they kind of came into the system. If you look at the universities and
*  the people involved and how they were almost given some kind of prizes for things they did.
*  I mean, there's an alternative story to the general narrative of how Google came to be.
*  So I think there was a lot of intelligence people involved in this, involved in setting it up.
*  And the psychology of Larry and Sergey, some psychologists have analyzed, and I've listened
*  to a lot of different people, is that they kind of become what their oppressor was to them.
*  And it's not really... I don't think they're bad guys, but this is psychosis that happens if you
*  grow up in some kind of stressed out situation. People who have been abused often abuse others.
*  And so I think that's what's going on. The problem is, I love all the technology. I love what
*  all these companies and everybody's doing. The business model is just fucking humanity.
*  It is. It's fucking us.
*  Yeah. By giving away data and by influencing people.
*  Or not letting us share in the revenue of the data.
*  Right.
*  Or having some control over it.
*  Do you think that there should be some sort of legislation that recognizes what data is
*  and that they'd look at it in terms of... Like it's a commodity and saying,
*  like selling and buying and selling...
*  Well, I think there is some of that.
*  But is there some that really evenly balances it or looks at it for what it really is?
*  Well, what is data? I mean, what is money? Money is data.
*  Right.
*  Money is not money anymore.
*  What are you providing? You're providing a service.
*  It's all data. It's all data.
*  Yeah. It is all data.
*  It has to be a trust relationship. And if their business model is what it is now,
*  if they don't change it, no legislation will stop them from getting around the problem.
*  But now it's you get free shit and we get your data. You get a free browser.
*  Here's the interesting thing.
*  Here's the interesting thing.
*  The internet is, although no longer quite the same way with upstream and downstream being equal
*  due to the cable companies and how they've implemented your personal connection,
*  we can still do our own servers.
*  It doesn't all have to be on YouTube, on Facebook, on Twitter.
*  There's an entire... I was talking earlier about Mastodon.
*  NoAgendaSocial.com is our own social network.
*  It's with open source software without algorithms.
*  And we federate with all these other servers, much the way the World Wide Web grew up.
*  And there's this mechanism for communicating with each other.
*  And so it's kind of Twitter meets email only. It looks like Twitter,
*  but you control a lot more of how it works.
*  And your community can be a small little community and you can have no one come in.
*  You can block people or just say, I only want these cool people to also connect or
*  that server to connect. It's all good. So you have all these
*  almost like an Ancestry.com tree, the branches to all these different places called the Federation.
*  And if we build upon those kinds of things and don't let other companies,
*  companies at all, there's no reason for them to get involved.
*  It's very cheap with a, believe it or not, a Linux laptop.
*  You can get started. Any kid can learn how to do it.
*  They should be teaching it at school, how to set up a server,
*  how to get around some of the hurdles, understand how an email server works.
*  And we will not need these companies. We can have all the joy and a lot of the downside,
*  but there won't be a Twitter police. There'll be only your own little community.
*  Say, Hey, we don't like this guy. We're just going to block you or your whole community.
*  Or we would love to have you guys with us and we can happen to us similarly.
*  And that's how you build these networks. And eventually you connect to each other on the
*  back end somehow anyway.
*  Pete Slauson How often do you think, I mean, how long do you think it's going to be before
*  we're implementing augmented reality into our life in that way, in like a social media context?
*  John Svigel Because you kind of got augmented reality already with your ears.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, so it would be unfair of me to say that it's augmented in that it's enhancing.
*  But I have enhanced it in ways that are particular to me, but it's not some algorithm
*  really determining things that I should hear. I'm in total control of how that works and how it
*  sounds. I don't see the case for augmented reality. I just don't see it.
*  John Svigel When you think about what the apple is trying to do with their glasses.
*  Pete Slauson Well, I think it's trying to get people from doing this to doing this.
*  John Svigel Yes, it probably is.
*  Pete Slauson That's all that it is. That's all that it is.
*  John Svigel But it's also probably adding to the experience, right? If you can have like little
*  animated fairies everywhere you go that you see through your apple glasses, everything else looks
*  the same. Do you ever go to the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland?
*  Pete Slauson Yes.
*  John Svigel You know, there's a ghost sitting right next to you?
*  Pete Slauson If I see you with one of those glasses on, I'm gonna go learn some
*  fucking muay thai. I'm gonna kick you in the fucking head. Boom, like Dalsum.
*  John Svigel What if it makes life so much crisper and brighter? You put these glasses on
*  and it syncs up to the little chip that you have in the middle of your brain. It gives you this
*  pleasure feeling and all of a sudden, everywhere's flowers, man. You walk through flowers.
*  Pete Slauson I'm always looking for the conditioning, you know,
*  that's getting us ready for these moments. And so, I think a beautiful moment is this
*  coronavirus where the testing is someone holding a gun-like sensor to your head.
*  John Svigel Whoa.
*  Pete Slauson I mean, that's preparing people for the barcode or the chip.
*  John Svigel How?
*  Pete Slauson You know, it's like, oh yeah, click, like a pet.
*  John Svigel How are they testing? Do you have to go to a hospital?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, the test takes a couple days. I think they have a test that'll go down a couple
*  hours but they swab deep in your throat or deep in your nose, like, it sounds kind of annoying.
*  John Svigel This whole thing is very, very spooky.
*  Well, it seems to happen every 100 years.
*  Pete Slauson Look, Joe.
*  John Svigel We're conditioned?
*  Pete Slauson We're conditioned through horror movies for this. I mean, my favorite part of
*  this script as it unravels was the Pope sneezing and coughing like, oh my God, the Pope, he's in
*  Italy, he has coronavirus. And like, if the Pope dies, this will freak out the world. And so,
*  we talked about it on the show, we're waiting like, oh my God. And today, they announced,
*  the Pope is fine, he's been tested, he does not have coronavirus. So, thank God.
*  John Svigel I think this is, sadly, we're reacting in all the wrong ways. This is completely
*  illogical what's going on. It's very illogical. It's the death rate and the amount of people who
*  are infected that is misunderstood. And so, people are just throwing numbers everywhere.
*  And meanwhile, I mean, even the New England Journal of Medicine, which includes Dr. Fauci,
*  who's on the team and who's been around in this business for a long time through the Obama
*  administration, Bush administration, yeah, he's been around. He said, look, this is probably going
*  to be no worse than a severe seasonal flu. Now, we know that seasonal flus can kill quite a lot of
*  people, you know, it could be 20, 30,000. So, in those aspects, it's kind of the same. But it's
*  being presented in a sensationalistic way that we're completely programmed to respond to. Remember,
*  we already have enlarged amygdala's because of all the triggering and wokeness going on.
*  So, give us a little, it's true, Joe, give us a little bit of fear with this thing that
*  we're conditioned through all kinds of horror movies and Netflix just had the pandemic movie on
*  just a couple months ago. So, we're primed. We're primed to be suckered into something.
*  And part of it may be the Patriot Act, which whatever's going on with the pandemic,
*  there's always something going on in the background.
*  Pete Slauson Do you think whenever there's something going on with the pandemic,
*  then they use it as an opportunity to sneak stuff in the background?
*  Joe Boudreau Yeah. So, I'm looking for the pandemic appropriate, the spending bill.
*  Pete Slauson Someone was trying to talk to me about that with natural disasters or any kind of
*  attack. And that there's automatically an understanding that people are willing to do
*  things they wouldn't normally be willing to do. So, this is when you move in with new legislation.
*  Joe Boudreau It's the amendment. So, you have a bill and the bill will be financing for
*  coronavirus, whatever that means. The president wanted two and a half million, two million. I
*  think like a million and a half was already kind of there.
*  Pete Slauson And you stuff a bunch of shit in that bill.
*  Joe Boudreau Well, exactly. And it's like a piece of the Patriot Act may actually get passed in that
*  because it's kind of like you cannot vote against this shit. Because how can you vote against
*  pandemic saver? Pete Slauson How can you vote against Patriot?
*  Joe Boudreau The Patriot Act?
*  Pete Slauson There are a lot of people in Congress right now trying to break the Patriot Act apart
*  because this is the spying bill where the government can just spy on you. We've been
*  talking about some of that. It's not cool. Joe Boudreau
*  This all really was implemented right after the September 11th attacks.
*  Pete Slauson It was already written. It was good to go.
*  Joe Boudreau Binnie from the CIA said, look, they were ready to spy on people long before then.
*  Pete Slauson Totally ready.
*  Joe Boudreau They.
*  Joe Boudreau They, those motherfuckers.
*  Crazy.
*  Joe Boudreau Adam, I hate to end this, but it's 310.
*  Pete Slauson Oh shit.
*  Joe Boudreau We've literally done this for three hours.
*  Pete Slauson It feels so good.
*  Joe Boudreau It was awesome, man. It was better than I expected.
*  Pete Slauson Uh oh.
*  Joe Boudreau I expected it to be awesome and it was even more awesome. I really enjoyed it.
*  We got to do it more often.
*  Pete Slauson I'd love to and thank you so much for having me on.
*  Joe Boudreau My pleasure. Thanks for fucking creating this thing, man.
*  Pete Slauson Wow.
*  Joe Boudreau You know, you're a big part of it. Your ideas of broadcasting, for sure,
*  part of the seeds that led to me doing this. So, thank you. Thank you very much.
*  Pete Slauson You're more than welcome, but thank you.
*  Everyone who really is around your show and all the comedians, I can die a happy man pretty much.
*  Not planning yet.
*  Joe Boudreau Stay alive, man. We love you.
*  Pete Slauson All right, thanks.
*  Joe Boudreau Bye everybody.
*  Pete Slauson Wow, that was a long chat.
