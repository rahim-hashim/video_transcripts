# JRE MMA Show #136 with Jamahal Hill
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6.0s)]
*  We're up. What's up champ? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10.0s)]
*  Pleasure to do this. Pleasure to have you in here man. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=14.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me man, I appreciate it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=17.0s)]
*  That was a phenomenal performance in Brazil against Glover Dechara in his hometown. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=19.0s)]
*  Last minute, like I mean how much time did you have to prep for that? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=26.0s)]
*  I had about six weeks. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=30.0s)]
*  Oh you did have six weeks. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=31.0s)]
*  Yeah I had six weeks. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=32.0s)]
*  But it was, you knew that it was supposed to be three rounds and then they changed it to the title for five rounds right? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=33.0s)]
*  No, it was a title right away. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=41.0s)]
*  Oh that was right after Ankolyev and Yambahovitch, so right from there? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=43.0s)]
*  They legitimately called me while they were still in the gauge. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=46.0s)]
*  If you wanted a full camp for a five round fight though, what would you prefer? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=52.0s)]
*  Like how much time do you really need? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=57.0s)]
*  I prefer about eight weeks, eight to about eight to ten weeks. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=58.0s)]
*  So slightly abbreviated, but your performance was phenomenal man. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=63.0s)]
*  I mean it was amazing to see you pick apart Glover like that and to do so well on the ground too. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=67.0s)]
*  I mean that was a big victory. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=74.0s)]
*  Yeah I mean a lot of people thought that I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=77.0s)]
*  That was just a general assumption was that I couldn't grapple on the ground and things like that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=81.0s)]
*  That's definitely. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=87.0s)]
*  But you're getting that general assumption from who though? People online? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=88.0s)]
*  Just picks, you know what I mean? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=91.0s)]
*  Just like people like an analyst, then like any of the fighters or whatever that I talked to, they were like, always say, it's always something that they say. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=94.0s)]
*  Even guys in the division, they were like, oh he's just a boxer. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=103.0s)]
*  I don't know if he can really wrestle or if he really has kicks or anything like that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=107.0s)]
*  They were questioning the kicks too. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=111.0s)]
*  That's some of the biggest moments in the fight, that left high kick yours. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=113.0s)]
*  Yeah, well people are going to question you until they can't anymore. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=117.0s)]
*  That's how it goes. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=121.0s)]
*  There's always, ah I don't know about this guy and then all of a sudden he's the best ever. You never know. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=123.0s)]
*  That's why I'm just hungry for names, man. I'm hungry for the next challenge. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=127.0s)]
*  What did it feel like when they strapped that thing around your waist? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=132.0s)]
*  Man, it's a hard thing to describe. It was just like almost unreal, almost like living in a dream, like one of the dreams that I've had. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=136.0s)]
*  It was just crazy, just the weight of everything that I did and been through and everything. It was a lot. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=149.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a lot for everybody. That's a moment that very few human beings will ever achieve. There's it right now. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=157.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's when he told me he was about to retire. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=165.0s)]
*  It's amazing how long that dude has hung in there. He was the boogie man for six years. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=170.0s)]
*  For six years, Glover lived in Brazil and he couldn't get a visa. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=176.0s)]
*  This was in the early days when Chuck Liddell was the UFC light heavyweight champion. That's how far back Glover goes. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=180.0s)]
*  I heard something about how he went pro in 2001. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=187.0s)]
*  Yeah, crazy. Right? Crazy. 22 years later. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=191.0s)]
*  Still fighting for the world championship. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=198.0s)]
*  That fight with Yuri Prochazka where he lost the title, that was a crazy close fight until he got caught in that choke. He was ahead. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=201.0s)]
*  I think he was. Yeah, he was ahead in that fight. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=209.0s)]
*  I believe he was. That video that you made to Yuri was hilarious. We played it on the podcast. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=212.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. Can't let it slide. That's what she said. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=218.0s)]
*  That's what she said. That was the first thing that came to my head whenever he said it. I'm coming. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=222.0s)]
*  Now, I can't. He's ruined the phrase for me now because now I can't say it at all. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=227.0s)]
*  No matter what, somebody calls me and be like, oh, I'm coming. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=235.0s)]
*  I'm coming. He's an odd duck. That dude's an odd duck. He's strange. He's very, very different. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=238.0s)]
*  Do you see when he was fighting Glover and Glover was beating him up, he was like, good job, good job. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=247.0s)]
*  Yeah, tapping him on the leg. I thought it was like, well, you can't do that, man. It looks like you're tapping. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=251.0s)]
*  It looks like you're tapping. Like, what are you doing? He's like, good job, good job. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=255.0s)]
*  But he's saying good job. And I think it was was it Mark Goddard who was a referee? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=259.0s)]
*  I think it was Mark Goddard. Whoever it was, was warning him. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=264.0s)]
*  It's like, hey, don't fucking slap him and say good job. You can't do that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=267.0s)]
*  Just what a weird thing to do. Guys on top of you, rain and blows down. You're like, good job. Good job. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=271.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. Only thing I can think would be possibly it could be like just like a tactic to try to make it seem like all like no matter what you're wasting your time. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=278.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. Try to like get in their head because I think even like with the whole samurai thing, like he wants to play. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=288.0s)]
*  He obviously wants to wants to this image to be believed of him. Yeah. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=294.0s)]
*  But I just seen him when I was at the P.I. a couple of days ago and he's he's a nice dude. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=300.0s)]
*  You know, he he walked up. He's like, nice to meet you. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=305.0s)]
*  Things like that. And then like I came back the next day. I was going into PT and he was working. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=308.0s)]
*  He's like, I'm working on it. I mean, working. I'm like, take your time. Do your thing. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=312.0s)]
*  He's already had the shoulder surgery, right? I don't know. I would assume if he's already trying to read. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=317.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure he has because apparently his shoulder was the worst shoulder they'd ever seen. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=322.0s)]
*  The UFC doctors have never seen a shoulder that fucked up before. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=327.0s)]
*  Do you know what happened to him? No. His shoulder went out of socket in training camp and they tried to put it back in. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=329.0s)]
*  And these dudes are yanking on it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=335.0s)]
*  These just gym dudes yanking on it and they fucked it up way worse. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=337.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's never a good idea. Go to a fucking doctor, man. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=341.0s)]
*  Hey, you're a world champion champion. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=345.0s)]
*  And he had to give up his title like that. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=348.0s)]
*  Well, it's interesting that he did decide to give up his title. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=350.0s)]
*  He could have held on to it and he could have had an interim title and you could be fighting him for the undisputed title. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=352.0s)]
*  But instead he's like, no, I'm going to give up my title. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=357.0s)]
*  That's why I say he's an odd dude. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=360.0s)]
*  That's strange because that's not only like a bad move legacy wise. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=362.0s)]
*  That's a bad business move. Yeah. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=371.0s)]
*  Because now your next fight, you fight as a challenger. Yeah. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=373.0s)]
*  You don't get the same pay per view bias. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=376.0s)]
*  You don't get the same amount of money and none of that. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=379.0s)]
*  So yeah, it doesn't make any sense. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=382.0s)]
*  I mean, I could imagine the thought process behind it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=384.0s)]
*  You want to be noble, but you got to take care of your money, bro. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=387.0s)]
*  You got to take care of your money. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=391.0s)]
*  I mean, how many world title fights you get if you're lucky, if everything goes perfect. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=393.0s)]
*  And he should know now, especially being injured like, hey, this could happen. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=398.0s)]
*  And you could get a catastrophic injury and you could be out for a year or so. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=402.0s)]
*  You never know. I think it was a play of him trying to be noble. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=405.0s)]
*  Just trying to be noble, trying to like, you know, he does the right thing where he respects the warrior. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=409.0s)]
*  I like how you're thinking about it like 3D chess. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=414.0s)]
*  Like, what is this motherfucker doing for real? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=417.0s)]
*  I'm trying to tell you, man, I think a lot of what he does is meant to put a certain image in your head. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=419.0s)]
*  You know, so I'm sure I mean, make sense. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=424.0s)]
*  It would be smart to do. I mean, he's got a weird image. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=428.0s)]
*  He's got a weird image. He's out there throwing kicks at trees. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=430.0s)]
*  You know, it's like wraps a tree up in a foam pad and starts punching it and kicking it like yelling in the woods. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=432.0s)]
*  Yeah. Okay, man. You know, gems are better. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=438.0s)]
*  Gems are definitely better than a tree. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=441.0s)]
*  I want to know what it is about being in the woods that just makes them want to yell. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=443.0s)]
*  What is it? Are you upset with the trees? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=448.0s)]
*  Do you just feel alone? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=453.0s)]
*  It's like you want to be heard. I mean, these are our projects. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=456.0s)]
*  Do you want to be heard? Right. Right. Yeah. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=459.0s)]
*  Does it make you more noble or sophisticated to be in the woods? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=462.0s)]
*  What is it? Remember when Rocky was training for Drago and Rocky IV? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=469.0s)]
*  Went to the woods, running in the snow, carrying logs and shit. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=474.0s)]
*  I think, man, if in the, it makes me feel weird just even saying it in the I'm coming video. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=478.0s)]
*  Damn it. I don't know another way to say it. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=490.0s)]
*  That's what she said. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=493.0s)]
*  This is crazy. Where you at though? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=494.0s)]
*  This is the video. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=497.0s)]
*  By the way, that's what she said. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=499.0s)]
*  That's what she said! [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=502.0s)]
*  And the one that he did though, it's like an axe in a tree stump in the background. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=504.0s)]
*  Yeah. Did you notice that? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=512.0s)]
*  No, I didn't notice that. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=514.0s)]
*  Yeah, bro. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=515.0s)]
*  It's probably out there chopping wood. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=516.0s)]
*  Chopping wood. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=517.0s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know. Look at him. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=518.0s)]
*  I'm coming. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=525.0s)]
*  I'm coming! [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=528.0s)]
*  It is fucking weird. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=530.0s)]
*  It's like, I guess I went into axe. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=532.0s)]
*  I might have been high when I said it. It could have just been that post right there. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=535.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't see an axe. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=538.0s)]
*  He's a strange cat, man. That's a strange cat. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=539.0s)]
*  That was just like, I don't know, man. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=543.0s)]
*  I'm coming. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=551.0s)]
*  Did you think he's next if they have any conversations with you about who's going to be your first title defense as the champion of the fucking world? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=552.0s)]
*  Yeah, sounds good. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=559.0s)]
*  Sounds good, right? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=561.0s)]
*  Sounds real fucking good. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=562.0s)]
*  And you earned the fuck out of that too. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=563.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. Glover was tough, man. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=565.0s)]
*  He's so tough. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=570.0s)]
*  Like, y'all said that, right? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=571.0s)]
*  I think we need to put a little bit more emphasis on it because it's not just that he's tough. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=575.0s)]
*  He's tough. He's tough. And while he's being tough, he's still fighting intelligently. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=583.0s)]
*  You get what I'm saying? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=588.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=589.0s)]
*  So for not one second did I hit him with something and it was like, oh shit. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=590.0s)]
*  I was like, oh, I don't want to get hit with whatever's next. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=596.0s)]
*  Cover up. You know what I mean? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=598.0s)]
*  I was like, that one, like, oh, I need to find protection type. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=600.0s)]
*  He never did that. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=604.0s)]
*  That was just crazy because it was one sequence, I think it was in the third, where I hit him with right hand, right hand, elbow, left hand. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=606.0s)]
*  It's like at no point was he like, oh shit, I need to cover up or anything because I finished you at that point. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=616.0s)]
*  But it's like, bro. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=623.0s)]
*  That was in the ground and pound sequence. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=624.0s)]
*  Yeah, when you're on top of it. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=626.0s)]
*  That was so close. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=627.0s)]
*  A lot of referees would have stopped it. A lot of referees would have stopped it there. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=629.0s)]
*  I mean, you were dropping bombs on him, but yeah, he kept moving. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=632.0s)]
*  He kept trying to, he's on quick. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=635.0s)]
*  He kicked me in the face. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=637.0s)]
*  From the bottom? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=639.0s)]
*  Yeah, he grabbed my arm and pulled me like he's going to try to pull me in his guard. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=640.0s)]
*  And then when I went in, as soon as I like, so obviously tonight's going, you got to sit up. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=644.0s)]
*  I sat up, he kicked me in the face. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=648.0s)]
*  He's a crafty fella. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=650.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=652.0s)]
*  I think his time with Alex Paheda really improved him too towards the very end of his career when he started training with Alex [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=653.0s)]
*  because there's something about having that dude in camp with him and he's on the run for the middleweight title that it all came together. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=662.0s)]
*  Some of his last fights were some of his best. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=669.0s)]
*  The Jan Bojovic fight, you know, I mean, the Yuri Prochaska fight. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=672.0s)]
*  Those fucking great fights, man. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=677.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's harder to hit clean than I thought. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=680.0s)]
*  Because he turns his face a little, rolls with stuff. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=685.0s)]
*  Yeah, a little bit of that, but it's like, it's his hands, right? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=687.0s)]
*  So he definitely learns from the people that he fights because he was definitely doing a little John Jones to me. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=692.0s)]
*  You know, the little, like going to kind of poke his hands out. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=698.0s)]
*  And he watched it a couple of times. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=701.0s)]
*  Like I wanted to follow up with some shots with some combos, but the way he was like blocking, he's like going like this [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=703.0s)]
*  and then you're like putting his elbow up like this, kind of like poking his fingers, like jibbing his fingers towards my face. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=709.0s)]
*  So that's a weird gray area, right? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=716.0s)]
*  You know, because John poked a lot of people in the eyes. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=720.0s)]
*  You know, I'm sure he didn't mean to do it, but that style of doing it like that, of having the hands out, especially when you're as long as John. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=724.0s)]
*  That's a, you know, it's a very, it's a very gray area. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=732.0s)]
*  You're not supposed to do that. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=736.0s)]
*  You're not supposed to do it, but it's done. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=738.0s)]
*  It's done. It's done. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=741.0s)]
*  It's done quite a bit, especially like whenever you see somebody get hit with something like solid and they start to like kind of get crowded [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=742.0s)]
*  and they want to get some space or they want to try to really keep you from coming for it. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=749.0s)]
*  That's the first thing that I do. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=754.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=755.0s)]
*  What could be done about that, though? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=756.0s)]
*  The eye pokes. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=758.0s)]
*  The only thing that I think is a change of the gloves. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=759.0s)]
*  They have to figure out something to make a better glove that doesn't encourage your hands to be open. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=761.0s)]
*  You know, we talked about this before, but Trevor Whitman, you know, a Gagee's trainer, he's got a way better glove. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=765.0s)]
*  He makes his own material onyx. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=771.0s)]
*  He makes his own gloves and shin pads and they're fucking top notch. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=774.0s)]
*  But he made a better glove. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=778.0s)]
*  And I don't know why the UFC is not using it. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=779.0s)]
*  I don't know what's going on. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=781.0s)]
*  I don't know if they have to get it approved by the commissions. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=782.0s)]
*  I don't know what the deal is, but it's a far superior glove. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=785.0s)]
*  Does it affect the grappling? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=787.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, it doesn't. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=789.0s)]
*  But it keeps your hand curved. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=790.0s)]
*  Like the natural state of it is to have your hand in a curved position versus open. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=792.0s)]
*  With the UFC gloves, you put those on, your hand wants to be open and you have to kind of close it and tighten it down. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=796.0s)]
*  With his gloves, it starts out in a folded position. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=802.0s)]
*  Like it's much easier. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=806.0s)]
*  So even if you were like extending your hand, you would extend it like you would if you had a boxing glove on. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=807.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=812.0s)]
*  You know, I just think there's got to be something. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=813.0s)]
*  So many fucking eye pokes. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=816.0s)]
*  You guys both poked each other. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=817.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=818.0s)]
*  Not by accident. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=819.0s)]
*  The only difference is when I poked him in the eye, it helped him. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=820.0s)]
*  All right, because that knee, that knee I caught him with right in the sternum right before that. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=824.0s)]
*  If I actually am able to put the frame on him like I want to, he's eating a head kick. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=829.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=834.0s)]
*  So yeah, same with me. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=836.0s)]
*  Whenever I poke, whenever he poked me in the eye, though, I was on his ass. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=839.0s)]
*  I was on his ass. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=842.0s)]
*  I think I just landed like uppercut. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=844.0s)]
*  Yeah, I just landed like an uppercut. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=847.0s)]
*  I was right after the little weave sequence. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=849.0s)]
*  It was smooth. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=852.0s)]
*  How many times have you watched it? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=854.0s)]
*  How many times have you watched it? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=856.0s)]
*  I watched it a few times. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=857.0s)]
*  I watched it a few times. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=858.0s)]
*  It was just one little sequence in the beginning. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=860.0s)]
*  Towards the end of the first round, it was just, I remember it happening in the fight, but I wanted to see how it looked on camera. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=863.0s)]
*  And it was all right. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=872.0s)]
*  Pretty smooth. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=874.0s)]
*  It was all right. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=875.0s)]
*  Listen, it was a very good performance. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=876.0s)]
*  It was very, you were very crafty. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=878.0s)]
*  That was the thing about the fight that I really enjoyed is like watching your setups and all your feints and luring them in and the way you're moving in and out. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=881.0s)]
*  Like it was very, because I had seen all that in other fights, but with all the stakes on the line in Brazil fighting for the title. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=890.0s)]
*  And I think you were at your best. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=899.0s)]
*  I really do. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=901.0s)]
*  I rise to the occasion. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=902.0s)]
*  I really lock in. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=903.0s)]
*  Like, you know, I understand. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=905.0s)]
*  I understand the situation. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=906.0s)]
*  I understand the moment. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=907.0s)]
*  So that's why I work so hard to get to it. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=908.0s)]
*  And then I trust the work that I put in. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=910.0s)]
*  You know, so at that point, it's just, I do what you do every day. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=912.0s)]
*  Everything. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=916.0s)]
*  You're pacing. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=917.0s)]
*  You just were so smart about when to hit the gas. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=918.0s)]
*  You know, when to like, just like give him looks and catch your breath. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=920.0s)]
*  And it was just phenomenal, man. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=925.0s)]
*  Nothing surprised me. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=927.0s)]
*  Like, nothing surprised me in that fight because everything like, you know, he's been, that's the thing about being around for a long time, right? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=928.0s)]
*  There's so much film on you. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=935.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, people watch your habits. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=936.0s)]
*  Then, you know, after you've been fighting for so long, people can see when you stop evolving. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=938.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=943.0s)]
*  So they can see like, all right, this is what he does. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=944.0s)]
*  You know, and then that's where it comes in. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=946.0s)]
*  Like, all right, this is what we know he's going to do. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=949.0s)]
*  This is what we're going to do in place of this. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=951.0s)]
*  You know, then we get Anthony Smith in and he's like, hey, there's some things that he does that surprised me in our fight. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=953.0s)]
*  I realize he did this and these are some things I would have done differently that, you know, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=960.0s)]
*  Like what kind of things did he do that surprised Anthony? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=964.0s)]
*  His grip. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=966.0s)]
*  I think he said his grip, the way, how strong he was, how hard it was to break his, like, to break his grip. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=968.0s)]
*  Risk control. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=974.0s)]
*  Yeah. So instead of trying to fight his grip, fight like the underhooks and fight like the positioning. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=975.0s)]
*  So like a couple of times he got his hands clasped behind my up, under my butt. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=982.0s)]
*  If you notice, I didn't fight his grip. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=988.0s)]
*  I wasn't fighting his grip. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=990.0s)]
*  I started fighting at his elbows. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=991.0s)]
*  I started fighting at his shoulders. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=992.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=993.0s)]
*  Just other things away from where his strengths were. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=994.0s)]
*  And then that trip that he got me down with in the fifth, Smith had told me about that. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=999.0s)]
*  So whenever he did it, so whenever he actually did it, he showed me about it. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1007.0s)]
*  I was like, I was slick. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1010.0s)]
*  So I actually feel it and it was like, all right, yeah, it was slick. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1011.0s)]
*  But it's like, all right, I know what to do. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1014.0s)]
*  Bang, I lay here. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1016.0s)]
*  That's why I don't panic. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1017.0s)]
*  None of that. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1020.0s)]
*  Chill and go through what I've been doing. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1021.0s)]
*  Everything we worked on was that. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1024.0s)]
*  Now your takedown defense was amazing too, because there was sometimes, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1028.0s)]
*  especially in the first round, he got pretty deep on you. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1031.0s)]
*  He just shucked it all off. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1034.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's why he kind of, he wasn't able to really fight and try to turn into a scramble [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1036.0s)]
*  because I wasn't going to allow him. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1043.0s)]
*  I wasn't going to allow him to turn into a scramble for a takedown. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1044.0s)]
*  So whenever he did shoot in, this man would have hard frames. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1047.0s)]
*  Whenever I was hitting those hip pumps, those hip pumps were hard. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1050.0s)]
*  So immediately hip bump, put a frame for him to fight through. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1054.0s)]
*  If you're going to get this takedown, it's going to cost you a lot to get it. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1059.0s)]
*  So that was pretty much the game plan, make him do that and make him work. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1063.0s)]
*  And then whenever we got range, touch him up. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1068.0s)]
*  Then you did that. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1073.0s)]
*  When you woke up in the morning the next day, was it like, what the fuck? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1076.0s)]
*  Did that really happen? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1079.0s)]
*  You think I went to sleep, Joe? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1081.0s)]
*  You think I went to sleep, Joe? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1083.0s)]
*  No time for sleep. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1087.0s)]
*  I dozed off for maybe like, we were up for, we were up until like maybe like 11, 11, 30. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1091.0s)]
*  I was like, we should probably take a nap or something and get some sleep. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1098.0s)]
*  I think like I went to my room, I laid down, I just like kind of laid there. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1103.0s)]
*  You know, I didn't really sleep. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1109.0s)]
*  Did you lay there next to the belt? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1111.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1113.0s)]
*  That's how they got that picture, that picture of me laying with the belt. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1114.0s)]
*  Eventually I dozed off for maybe like an hour, hour and a half. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1117.0s)]
*  Maybe it was like a couple hours after we had our, everybody went to go lay down and everything. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1121.0s)]
*  I dozed off for maybe like an hour, hour and a half after sitting up for a while. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1127.0s)]
*  Then I woke up and they were all like up on the roof, so we just kind of went up on the roof and a little bar up there and stuff. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1131.0s)]
*  Just hung out. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1137.0s)]
*  New world. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1139.0s)]
*  You're in a new world. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1141.0s)]
*  Yeah, bro, it's crazy, you know, but it's, I don't know. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1143.0s)]
*  There it is. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1147.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I was asleep. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1149.0s)]
*  I eventually passed out and then, yeah, they got... [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1152.0s)]
*  What was your experience like in Brazil? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1156.0s)]
*  Did you like it there? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1158.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, actually. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1159.0s)]
*  It was beautiful, right? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1160.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was beautiful. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1161.0s)]
*  Nice fucking people. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1162.0s)]
*  Nice people, great weather, beautiful sights. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1163.0s)]
*  Great food. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1167.0s)]
*  Beautiful sights. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1168.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1169.0s)]
*  All kinds of sights, right? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1170.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1171.0s)]
*  Different kind of sights there. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1172.0s)]
*  Makes you look at sights a little different. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1176.0s)]
*  Yeah, like wow, there's some genetics down here. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1178.0s)]
*  No, what? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1180.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1182.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1184.0s)]
*  Beautiful. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1185.0s)]
*  Yeah, beautiful, beautiful. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1186.0s)]
*  Great people, man. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1187.0s)]
*  It's a wild place to be too because when you think about Brazil and the UFC and Jiu Jitsu, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1188.0s)]
*  it's all from there. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1194.0s)]
*  I mean, without Brazil, the UFC would not be what it is. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1195.0s)]
*  I mean, who knows if it would have ever even happened or if it happened way, way later. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1198.0s)]
*  And if it wasn't for Horry and Gracie, it wasn't for the Gracie family, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1202.0s)]
*  it wasn't for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, we wouldn't be here. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1206.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, man. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1209.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1210.0s)]
*  Crazy that one family can have such an impact on the martial arts world. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1211.0s)]
*  Hey, it had an impact on me. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1216.0s)]
*  Coiler Gracie, the guy in my corner, that's Hoyes Gracie's nephew. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1219.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1223.0s)]
*  So that's who our head instructor under our training, under our Jiu Jitsu program, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1224.0s)]
*  that's who we've been training under for, I think we joined under him maybe like about 10 years ago. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1234.0s)]
*  When did you, what was the first UFC that you saw? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1241.0s)]
*  How old were you? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1245.0s)]
*  The first UFC I saw was the Anderson Silver vs. Forrest Griffin, I think I was like 19. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1246.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1251.0s)]
*  I was 18. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1252.0s)]
*  That was a good one to see because Anderson was a wizard back then. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1253.0s)]
*  He was a wizard. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1257.0s)]
*  That's what got me hooked, you know what I'm saying? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1258.0s)]
*  Like that's really what started the path towards all of this because like, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1261.0s)]
*  so I've been in a lot of fights growing up, right? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1269.0s)]
*  So like, I'm like, growing up, I've been in different, I fought big, small, short, fast, all these dudes, right? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1272.0s)]
*  And sitting there watching that and seeing what he did to him, it was like, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1281.0s)]
*  okay, can I do that? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1291.0s)]
*  And if I, and right now, I can't do that, I definitely don't want to run into somebody that can do that. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1295.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1303.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1304.0s)]
*  I think I should probably become one of those guys that can do that. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1305.0s)]
*  You know, when people talk about goats, you know, and I do think John Jones is a great argument for the greatest of all time, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1309.0s)]
*  just based on his record, but I feel like there's moments in guys' careers, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1315.0s)]
*  and those moments kind of get diluted when you see later performances that aren't as good, maybe when they're older. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1321.0s)]
*  But when Anderson was in his prime, he was a magician. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1326.0s)]
*  There was something about him, man. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1332.0s)]
*  He was like, he had this unstoppable aura. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1334.0s)]
*  He was so at peace and so calm, and he would smile at guys, and you knew he was fucking them up. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1337.0s)]
*  He was fucking everybody up, and it was the way he was doing it. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1342.0s)]
*  He was doing it like it was magic. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1346.0s)]
*  You know, when he knocked out Forrest, it was like Forrest didn't have a chance in the world of hitting him. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1348.0s)]
*  He was just waiting for the spot, pa-pink, moving backwards. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1353.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1356.0s)]
*  I never seen anything like it, just a whoop, whoop. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1357.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1362.0s)]
*  Bang! [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1363.0s)]
*  Yeah, when he was on, when he was at his best, like the Vitor Belfort fight, during those times in his prime, man, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1364.0s)]
*  when he first got into the UFC, when he lit up Chris Liebman, I was like, oh boy, everybody's fucked. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1371.0s)]
*  Everybody in this division's fucked. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1377.0s)]
*  And it was just one of those times where it was like you saw a guy who was like total next level, who had just entered into the sport. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1379.0s)]
*  And it changed everybody's idea of like what was possible with striking. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1385.0s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1389.0s)]
*  He definitely, definitely did that for me. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1391.0s)]
*  I still have this, whenever I first started, like am I amateur, like early on amateur, like my first fights, my first, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1393.0s)]
*  and I think I made my amateur debut back like, I think it was like March 6th, 2010 or something like that. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1400.0s)]
*  So like I used to watch, I used to have this entrance to the highlight video and just roll through like of all these fights and things. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1407.0s)]
*  And I don't know, something about just watching that video made me feel like, all right, like just watching greatness made me believe that I could be great. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1415.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1421.0s)]
*  So I used to watch it before every fight and I was just going in and annihilating people. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1422.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1429.0s)]
*  Actually, my second amateur fight was against my godbrother, right? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1430.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1436.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1437.0s)]
*  So he actually had brought, after I watched the entrance to the fight, he had a fight. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1438.0s)]
*  He did like an MMA fight. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1446.0s)]
*  And like he came back, he had the video, so you know, I was seeing him like, oh, like, you know, it's like, it was like, all right, it can actually be done. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1448.0s)]
*  It's actually possible. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1455.0s)]
*  Like it's actually a scene for it around here. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1456.0s)]
*  Then that's when I found my own gym. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1458.0s)]
*  That's when I found my coaches, like my coaches that are here with me. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1461.0s)]
*  And I started training with them. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1466.0s)]
*  And I'd say like maybe like four months later, four and a half months later. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1468.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1474.0s)]
*  Four months later, I ended up fighting him on like a week notice. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1475.0s)]
*  Did you guys have a conversation? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1480.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1482.0s)]
*  Whenever they hit me, ever asked me about it, I was like, all right, let me hit him up and I'm going to talk to him about it. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1483.0s)]
*  And he was like, yeah, you know, he was like, it's just a sport. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1487.0s)]
*  It's how it is. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1491.0s)]
*  It's what we got into it. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1492.0s)]
*  You know, it's part of the game. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1493.0s)]
*  You know, of course, now I feel differently about it just for the simple fact of like we ain't really making no money. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1494.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1502.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1503.0s)]
*  So it was like, now it would have been a no. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1504.0s)]
*  But I'm just now getting into it. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1508.0s)]
*  I'm trying to get the experience. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1509.0s)]
*  I'm trying to, you know, whatever. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1510.0s)]
*  So we did and I ended up winning in like, I think it was like 40 something seconds. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1512.0s)]
*  And then I ended up choking this guy out after that in like 30 seconds. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1519.0s)]
*  So when I came out, I was just whooping people. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1526.0s)]
*  And then my fourth amateur fight was a title fight. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1530.0s)]
*  And it was a lot like the Glover to Shera fight, bro. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1536.0s)]
*  I whooped this dude's ass, bro. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1540.0s)]
*  Like for rounds, like his like his lip was like almost inside out. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1543.0s)]
*  His eye was like, was like gashed above his eye was completely closed. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1550.0s)]
*  But he would not stop coming after me, bro. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1556.0s)]
*  He would not stop coming at me just just steady, just like trying to hit me. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1559.0s)]
*  And then like, I think I got tired. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1564.0s)]
*  But they were like, I think like the first round, the first round, I had him down pending a full amount, pounding him like pounding him out. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1567.0s)]
*  And they stopped around like a minute early. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1577.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1579.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1580.0s)]
*  Was he a hometown guy? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1581.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1582.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1583.0s)]
*  So he was like, like, yeah, trying to save him. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1584.0s)]
*  And there was no commission. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1588.0s)]
*  You got to think there's no there's no commission back in Michigan back in the day. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1589.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1592.0s)]
*  So it was just like basically like guys just ran out of the huge, ran out of cage and putting on fights. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1593.0s)]
*  And so like, yeah, bro, it was it was then the next round, I think I caught him with a head kick and they stopped it a minute early again. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1599.0s)]
*  You know, then I end up eventually getting tired. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1608.0s)]
*  That's why like amateur wise, like it was eventually it was just like, it's a no contest. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1610.0s)]
*  But I actually got caught in a guillotine at the end of that. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1615.0s)]
*  And like after I got tired, I got things like maybe like the fourth, fifth round or something like that, I got caught in a guillotine because I just tried to shoot on him. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1618.0s)]
*  I just tried to shoot like I'm tired. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1626.0s)]
*  I'm gonna hold him down, catch my breath. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1629.0s)]
*  And then, you know, but I didn't finish the takedown. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1631.0s)]
*  You know, like it was it was not not my best work, Joe. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1633.0s)]
*  Not my best work. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1637.0s)]
*  And I got caught in a guillotine. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1638.0s)]
*  Did you you started your training with just MMA? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1640.0s)]
*  Is that the first training you'd ever done? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1644.0s)]
*  You've done any karate or anything when you were younger? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1646.0s)]
*  When I was a kid, I did taekwondo. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1649.0s)]
*  I did like a little taekwondo whenever I was a kid. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1651.0s)]
*  But most of it was just like like stuff my dad showed me. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1653.0s)]
*  Like, you know, I mean, just about like how to how to how to hold tight, how to roll with punches and things like that. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1657.0s)]
*  And then like my uncles, like my uncle showed me things like I was always into martial arts. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1663.0s)]
*  You know, so my brother that I that passed away before I before I before I went pro, he he was in the martial arts like I was, you know, so like, you know, he would he would he would hear some things that he was really smart. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1668.0s)]
*  You know, so he hears some things you see some techniques he showed me and we just kind of dialogue about things, you know, they like, you know, you have like movies like The Matrix and stuff like that. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1685.0s)]
*  So like you obviously like obviously the stuff wasn't real. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1695.0s)]
*  Right. But like you. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1698.0s)]
*  But even in even in like some of that, like they they mimic certain real martial arts like Wing Chung is a real thing. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1699.0s)]
*  Maybe not like the most effective thing, but parts of it are effective, you know, and that's kind of like our thing. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1707.0s)]
*  Like, I will part to what martial arts are effective. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1712.0s)]
*  So he was already like essentially kind of in playing with martial arts without even like really like knowing. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1714.0s)]
*  You know, so it's just an interest, though. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1723.0s)]
*  Tony Ferguson uses Wing Chung. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1727.0s)]
*  You see, he does a lot of Wing Chun dummies. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1729.0s)]
*  You know, he practices with the dummy, but you see it in fights sometimes like he'll catch he'll catch a wrist and use an elbow or he'll catch a wrist and come with a punch. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1732.0s)]
*  There's something to it. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1741.0s)]
*  There's certain parts of every martial art that can be effective. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1743.0s)]
*  As long as you combine them with the stuff that we know is effective. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1746.0s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1749.0s)]
*  There's just some that are more effective, like boxing, wrestling, kickboxing, you know. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1750.0s)]
*  But if you can have strong fundamentals in those and then be able to sprinkle in some of the things like some people do, that's what that's why you get the crazy spinning attacks from some dudes. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1755.0s)]
*  Like Jair Rodriguez is fighting this weekend. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1764.0s)]
*  Those are just different techniques. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1767.0s)]
*  You know, those are just different different arts. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1769.0s)]
*  And then he's just picking which one out of which bag that he wants to go like spinning kicks and like T kicks. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1774.0s)]
*  Those are more like karate, you know, but they're more generalized now in MMA. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1780.0s)]
*  Leg kicks, that's a Muay Thai thing. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1787.0s)]
*  You know, calf kicks, Muay Thai. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1791.0s)]
*  A jab, a jab is really more boxing based, you know, but it's effective in all more more forms of fighting. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1795.0s)]
*  So it's just like that. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1803.0s)]
*  Did you so you started like hardcore training? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1806.0s)]
*  You were 18 around there. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1809.0s)]
*  So that was like when you really just started learning everything. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1811.0s)]
*  So learning everything together, wrestling, jiu jitsu, kickboxing, all of it together. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1814.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1819.0s)]
*  I started out with jiu jitsu and Muay Thai basically. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1820.0s)]
*  And then how long into it were you like, I think I could be a world champion. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1825.0s)]
*  See, that's the thing about me being arrogant. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1831.0s)]
*  When I got into it originally, I thought I could be a world champion, you know, but it's just like you never really know. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1833.0s)]
*  But you think about like when you were a kid and you can believe you could do anything. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1839.0s)]
*  That's the type of belief that I have. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1843.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's just never changed. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1845.0s)]
*  You know, like I'm realistic, you know, I mean about things like, all right, if I can't, but how much I want something and things like that. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1847.0s)]
*  But as far as like believe in what I can do, I can do anything, you know. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1855.0s)]
*  So it's like whenever I stepped in and say, yeah, world champion because whenever I came in, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1860.0s)]
*  although I watched Anderson Silverman and I was in all of them, I wanted to know, can I whoop his ass? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1867.0s)]
*  So that's what my job was. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1873.0s)]
*  That's what that was. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1875.0s)]
*  That was me chasing Anderson Silverman to see if I can. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1876.0s)]
*  I started fighting at 185 when I was 18. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1878.0s)]
*  I was fighting 185 because you're not like you're not real heavy for 205. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1881.0s)]
*  What do you walk around that when you're training? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1887.0s)]
*  When I walk around when training, maybe like 230 to 230. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1890.0s)]
*  That's not like some of those guys get big. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1895.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I can't. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1897.0s)]
*  I can't get up to around like 240, 245. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1898.0s)]
*  That's around what I was whenever they called me for the Gover fight. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1901.0s)]
*  You don't think you can make 185 again? [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1904.0s)]
*  I probably could. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1906.0s)]
*  Champ champ. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1908.0s)]
*  For the right fight. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1909.0s)]
*  That would be a good fight. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1910.0s)]
*  Or champ champ champ. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1912.0s)]
*  Champ champ champ. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1914.0s)]
*  Oh, heavyweight too. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1915.0s)]
*  Why not? [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1916.0s)]
*  Why not? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1917.0s)]
*  You can't make welterweight. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1918.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1919.0s)]
*  I don't know how the fuck he makes it. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1921.0s)]
*  No. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1923.0s)]
*  When you're around that dude like in between fights, you're like, what the fuck is going on? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1924.0s)]
*  There's not a world where you weigh 170 pounds. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1928.0s)]
*  I don't think I've ever seen him in person. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1931.0s)]
*  He's a big file, big fellow. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1932.0s)]
*  He's big. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1934.0s)]
*  He's Johnny Walker. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1935.0s)]
*  I don't know how Johnny Walker makes 205. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1936.0s)]
*  He's huge. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1938.0s)]
*  He's huge. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1939.0s)]
*  He's huge. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1940.0s)]
*  And like it was like most dudes that are big like tall like that, they'd be like skinny. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1941.0s)]
*  Where's he skinny at? [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1944.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1945.0s)]
*  He's big. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1946.0s)]
*  He's just a big dude. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1947.0s)]
*  He looks like a heavyweight. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1948.0s)]
*  When you dropped him, dude, that was one of the craziest knockouts. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1949.0s)]
*  It was like Timber. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1952.0s)]
*  At first I wasn't like, I don't know, man. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1954.0s)]
*  It was just like from my point of view, like I slipped, I slipped, bang. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1957.0s)]
*  I felt the clean connection. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1962.0s)]
*  And then he, but he had swung too. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1964.0s)]
*  So like, you know, I kind of dip, I kind of dip back. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1968.0s)]
*  And then when I look, when I look, all I see is his hands back. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1971.0s)]
*  Not to me, I know that's like a, yeah. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1973.0s)]
*  And when his hands go up, like I'm like, okay, that's like a, that's like a he's hurt type thing. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1976.0s)]
*  That's why I just load it up to just follow up. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1980.0s)]
*  You know, I'm not thinking like, oh, he's out right there and there. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1982.0s)]
*  It's funny because I've heard people like not believe in your power and I don't understand it. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1984.0s)]
*  I've had conversations with people that are, oh, he doesn't hit that hard. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1990.0s)]
*  I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about? [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1993.0s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1996.0s)]
*  You're watching people fly across the ring and go unconscious. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1997.0s)]
*  Like how are you, how do you think he's not hitting hard? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=1999.0s)]
*  Like what, it's weird when some people just decide that someone is not as good. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2002.0s)]
*  And like, I'm seeing something. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2008.0s)]
*  I'm watching you fight. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2010.0s)]
*  And I'm like, this, this dude's clever. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2011.0s)]
*  Like this, this dude's dangerous. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2013.0s)]
*  He catches chins. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2015.0s)]
*  You know how to catch chins. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2016.0s)]
*  You have like a sense of like where they're at and where they're going to go. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2017.0s)]
*  And then you find them. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2021.0s)]
*  I'm like, that's a, that's a unusual talent. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2022.0s)]
*  And I was, some people are like, oh, he doesn't hit that hard. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2025.0s)]
*  He didn't hit Johnny that hard. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2028.0s)]
*  I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2029.0s)]
*  Watch that. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2031.0s)]
*  What happened there? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2032.0s)]
*  That was as, that's about as clean as you can lay in the shot, especially to the temple. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2033.0s)]
*  You know, I understand. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2036.0s)]
*  I understand fighting. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2039.0s)]
*  You know, whenever I was sitting, learning and being taught things, I not only wanted to know how to do it, I wanted to know why, how to like, you know, I mean the, the, the physics behind it, you know, and, and then doing that, I understand the fighting and angles and things like that on a, on a different level. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2040.0s)]
*  You know, it's like, how can I explain this? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2059.0s)]
*  The three things that I know that I, that I, that I know that I can do that, what I see in constant fights that most people don't do, I understand where I am in a fight as far as positional wise. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2065.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2080.0s)]
*  What's happening in the fight? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2081.0s)]
*  What my options are and what they're trying to do. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2083.0s)]
*  You know, and it's just like, it's just almost like embedded into like my senses to where my body reacts to what I'm doing. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2087.0s)]
*  Where my body reacts and it does the things like naturally. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2094.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2097.0s)]
*  So it's like, that's why I like that, that part in that part in a fight where I just flowed and just, and just move and just like, it's like, did I see what he was throwing? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2098.0s)]
*  Honestly, no. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2109.0s)]
*  But you kind of knew where it was going. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2111.0s)]
*  But I understood based off of where his punch was, what's next? [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2112.0s)]
*  It's crazy, especially when I'm locked in. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2115.0s)]
*  It's like one of the dopest feelings in the world that I wish like, I could like plug like a wire from myself in the other, so they could like just, just see it maybe from my eyes or just how I'm feeling it or whatever. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2118.0s)]
*  But it's just like, that's how I knew I was really good. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2131.0s)]
*  You know, I think it was before the Santos fight. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2135.0s)]
*  We were in the back or we were doing pad work and I was just flowing. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2139.0s)]
*  You know, and I was feeling good and I'm hitting the pads. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2142.0s)]
*  I'm like, all right. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2144.0s)]
*  And I'm now, sometimes whenever I hit pads, I like kind of put myself out of work, out of work angle and just, just to try, try different things. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2145.0s)]
*  You know, just to land here, to get here, to get to where I want to get here. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2151.0s)]
*  And like, it just hit me like, there's nothing in a fight that I can't do. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2154.0s)]
*  And there's nothing that I can't do in a fight at the highest level. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2160.0s)]
*  And like, it was like, I've been working head down, working so long, just adding to my bag, adding to my bag. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2163.0s)]
*  And I never really actually looked up and looked at what I had. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2169.0s)]
*  And in that moment, that was one of the times that I actually did. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2172.0s)]
*  And I realized like, I'm ready to be the best in the world. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2176.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? For real. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2179.0s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2182.0s)]
*  I felt that. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2183.0s)]
*  You know what's inspiring about that? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2184.0s)]
*  There's some young kid that was just like you that's probably watching that fight and watching what you did and like practicing it and fucking around in his living room and fucking around with his friends. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2186.0s)]
*  And it's like, I think I can do this too. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2196.0s)]
*  You know, like your success will inspire someone the same way Anderson Silva inspired you. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2198.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2203.0s)]
*  Isn't that amazing? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2204.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2205.0s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2206.0s)]
*  And like having that ability to see those great fighters too is so huge for young up and coming guys. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2207.0s)]
*  Because having someone who's just coming up who could see you or having, you know, those tapes, you could watch Fador and watch Anderson and watch all the fighters that were in their primes. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2214.0s)]
*  Like you get this sense of what's possible and then you go and try to incorporate that into your own game and it just makes everybody better. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2225.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2233.0s)]
*  I was hungry for evolution. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2234.0s)]
*  So like I had a period where like I just wanted to learn and just get be able to do like like just flow through flow. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2236.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2245.0s)]
*  Like like like I don't know if you ever been in a fight or been like in training. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2246.0s)]
*  You just flow and like you spar. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2250.0s)]
*  You just flow and you just like feeling good. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2252.0s)]
*  You're not even thinking. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2254.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2255.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2256.0s)]
*  You know, I just wanted to add to that. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2257.0s)]
*  Like being able to do it in more positions and more more step more more angles. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2259.0s)]
*  You know, I just wanted to do so. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2263.0s)]
*  I was legitimately renting the fights. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2265.0s)]
*  I've rented a lot of fights from like I think it was family video. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2269.0s)]
*  They had a bunch of they had a bunch of USC. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2272.0s)]
*  So like I'm renting those. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2274.0s)]
*  I'm pulling up YouTube YouTube boxing videos, you know, some kickboxing. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2276.0s)]
*  So like any little things that I can try to learn it actually like I read that was nice. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2282.0s)]
*  That was effective. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2287.0s)]
*  And then I could start to do it and then try to turn it flipping into my own. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2288.0s)]
*  You know, like that was one of the things that was hard coming up like like whenever people like, oh, you can't do this. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2292.0s)]
*  Can you do this? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2299.0s)]
*  Like, bro, my bag is deep. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2300.0s)]
*  Like my bag is deep. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2302.0s)]
*  And it's just now I just get to show it now. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2303.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2308.0s)]
*  I mean, I was because I was just about winning. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2309.0s)]
*  And still the thing is about you. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2313.0s)]
*  Like how old do you know? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2315.0s)]
*  31 31 start training at 18. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2317.0s)]
*  Like you're still getting better. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2320.0s)]
*  Like this is this is not like you just honing your skills and keeping them tight. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2322.0s)]
*  Like no, you're you're constantly improving. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2326.0s)]
*  And that's not a lot of time of training. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2329.0s)]
*  You know, you really become like elite at what you're doing. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2332.0s)]
*  And, you know, with whatever the 10,000 hour rule is, you apply that like you're you're like still getting better. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2336.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I still had to I still had years. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2343.0s)]
*  I had years where I had to take off, you know, I mean, where I had to do other things and stuff like that. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2345.0s)]
*  I mean, I always had periods when, you know, and there's still no time a little bit where I didn't make it to the gym a few times. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2351.0s)]
*  But like, yeah, it hasn't been a whole solid 13 years. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2359.0s)]
*  And now that you're the champ, like more resources are available to you, more time, you know, and then also there's the confidence that comes from being a champ. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2364.0s)]
*  Like most guys when they become champ, then they hit another level. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2373.0s)]
*  They hit another level once they're champ. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2377.0s)]
*  Yeah, it just just I did feel that a little something different just and just in how the way it happened. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2379.0s)]
*  Like everything went how how we thought it was going to go. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2386.0s)]
*  You know, I did think I was going to have to deal with some adversity. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2392.0s)]
*  So he landed some shots, you know, but I'm good at rolling shots. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2395.0s)]
*  I'm good at rolling off with shots. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2399.0s)]
*  You know, that's why sometimes you see I get hit and I don't give any space. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2401.0s)]
*  That's because you may you may have touched me, but you didn't hit me. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2404.0s)]
*  Right. You know what I mean? [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2407.0s)]
*  So it's like not a lot of guys that have this not have that have this skill in the understanding that I have are actually willing to just get in and fight to, you know, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2408.0s)]
*  because at any at any day you push it, you push it, you push that envelope enough to where it's like, all right, the thing is now you have to fight this. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2420.0s)]
*  I'm good with that, you know, and I have fun with that, too. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2428.0s)]
*  You know, it's just I don't know, man. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2432.0s)]
*  I'm just built for this. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2434.0s)]
*  Well, that's what it takes. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2435.0s)]
*  You want to be a world champion. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2437.0s)]
*  You have to have that crazy belief in yourself like you had in the very beginning. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2439.0s)]
*  You got to put in that time and you have that hunger and desire. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2443.0s)]
*  You got it all. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2446.0s)]
*  That's a beautiful thing, man. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2447.0s)]
*  Top of the world, Jamal Hill. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2449.0s)]
*  That's the fun. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2451.0s)]
*  I just it's just fun being in there, man. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2452.0s)]
*  I just have fun now being in there like this. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2455.0s)]
*  I feel like I'm just locked into something just like different. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2458.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2462.0s)]
*  Like whenever for anybody like young man listening or whatever, just like it's like for me, it's like whenever you doing something like you really good at like maybe you ever seen like like back. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2463.0s)]
*  I was about to say back in high school, we might have different experiences in high school. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2475.0s)]
*  I was in high school with road horses. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2482.0s)]
*  Like typing. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2484.0s)]
*  Have you ever seen like like somebody that can type like straight up like this? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2485.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2489.0s)]
*  I can't type like that. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2490.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2491.0s)]
*  But so but there was a time where I did take typing class or I did kind of get it. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2492.0s)]
*  So like I can understand like it's like when you really good at something, when you really good at something and you're just doing it and it just comes naturally to you. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2499.0s)]
*  Maybe not a lot of other people can do it. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2507.0s)]
*  Like that's how I feel whenever I'm fighting. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2510.0s)]
*  I don't feel like anybody else can really do what I do. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2512.0s)]
*  Well, that's a big part of being a great champion. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2515.0s)]
*  You have to have that belief that you are the one, you know, and it's not an easy road. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2518.0s)]
*  It's the craziest lifestyle choice. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2525.0s)]
*  Like as a professional person, like decide I'm going to be a professional fighter and a professional fighter in mixed martial arts. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2528.0s)]
*  It's one of the craziest choices you can make in life. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2536.0s)]
*  But if you can pull it off and if you can get to that world championship level and they strap that how much does that thing weigh? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2538.0s)]
*  It's got some weight. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2545.0s)]
*  It's got some weight to it. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2546.0s)]
*  That's why they put that thing around. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2547.0s)]
*  When you look back at fights like that that you had in the octagon and you learned from, does any fight like where you like made a big leap? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2548.0s)]
*  Does any fight like stand out for you? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2557.0s)]
*  Like what about the Paul Craig fight? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2559.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, the Paul Craig fight, honestly, the thing that came from that is realization that you're not better than you're not better than the game. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2563.0s)]
*  You're not invincible. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2571.0s)]
*  Respect. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2572.0s)]
*  I mean, respect the game. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2573.0s)]
*  You're not better than the game. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2574.0s)]
*  You're not invincible. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2575.0s)]
*  Respect. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2576.0s)]
*  I mean, respect the craft and respect what you're doing. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2577.0s)]
*  That's what that was in that fight. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2579.0s)]
*  It was basically I don't care what you do, regardless. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2581.0s)]
*  I'm not worried about nothing. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2584.0s)]
*  All I got to do is show up and I win. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2586.0s)]
*  That's really how I felt. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2588.0s)]
*  I felt like all I had to do was show up and I was going to win. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2589.0s)]
*  And I paid for that. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2592.0s)]
*  You know, I went out like he didn't he didn't pull me down. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2594.0s)]
*  I went down with him willingly, you know, with him already having my arm locked and everything like that. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2598.0s)]
*  And then I'm like, all right, watch this. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2603.0s)]
*  Start working the legs. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2604.0s)]
*  But that was the one way he had to win. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2605.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2608.0s)]
*  And I gave it to him. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2609.0s)]
*  He's so dangerous off his back, too. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2611.0s)]
*  It's such a different level off his back. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2614.0s)]
*  But I understand that. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2616.0s)]
*  But that's the thing, though. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2617.0s)]
*  I didn't care. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2618.0s)]
*  I didn't respect that at all. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2619.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2622.0s)]
*  And that's what that was. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2623.0s)]
*  What the lesson was for me to learn there. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2624.0s)]
*  Take from that respect the game. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2626.0s)]
*  Give every treat everybody like they're the absolute best in the world at what they do at everything. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2627.0s)]
*  He's a good guy to learn from, too, because his level on the ground is above and beyond most people's above and beyond his level office. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2633.0s)]
*  But he tapped on Goliath with like one second to go. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2643.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2646.0s)]
*  I mean, he's something special off his back. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2647.0s)]
*  If you that guy is one of the best grapplers at 205 in the world, he's so fucking good. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2649.0s)]
*  Like, I think Paul Craig could I think if he dedicated himself, he could be a world champion at legit straight grappling. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2655.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2662.0s)]
*  A thousand. He's that good. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2663.0s)]
*  He's that good. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2664.0s)]
*  When he locks triangles on people, you're like, oh, shit. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2665.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2668.0s)]
*  It's a triangle. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2669.0s)]
*  I mean, he's a dangerous. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2670.0s)]
*  When he locked onto my arm, he was strong as shit. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2671.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2674.0s)]
*  His grappling. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2675.0s)]
*  He grabs just like desperately. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2676.0s)]
*  It's almost like complete desperate. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2677.0s)]
*  Like you're about to grab like how you would grab a rope when you're about to fall off a cliff or some shit. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2678.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2682.0s)]
*  He grabbed my arm. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2683.0s)]
*  Like you don't want to die. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2686.0s)]
*  That's how he grabbed my arm. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2687.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2689.0s)]
*  And then whenever I like literally whenever I base and I try to pull my arm, if you look, my arm didn't move at all. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2690.0s)]
*  There was no wiggle. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2696.0s)]
*  You know how you do it. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2697.0s)]
*  You kind of shit. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2698.0s)]
*  None of that. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2699.0s)]
*  There was no movement whatsoever. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2700.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2703.0s)]
*  Well, some guys, when they get to the ground, they don't want to go 100 percent because they don't want to burn themselves out. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2704.0s)]
*  But Paul Craig, like he could close it off. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2709.0s)]
*  He's so confident in his ability to close it off. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2711.0s)]
*  He just cinches everything down. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2713.0s)]
*  Right away. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2715.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2716.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2717.0s)]
*  And that kind of that kind of took me by surprise. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2718.0s)]
*  I thought he was going to be more like a tactical goal, like all this next step, this step, this step, this and that. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2720.0s)]
*  Try to set up. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2724.0s)]
*  But he was strong and then he was still doing those things. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2725.0s)]
*  So did you leave that fight thinking fuck, I got to learn how to do that off my back? [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2729.0s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2734.0s)]
*  No, because I feel I didn't feel like. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2735.0s)]
*  Oh, my ground game was shit or anything like that. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2738.0s)]
*  I just felt like I fucked up by going doing things on his terms. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2741.0s)]
*  I let him dictate the fight. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2745.0s)]
*  I could have. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2747.0s)]
*  Could I beat Paul Craig on the ground? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2748.0s)]
*  Even then, even then? [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2750.0s)]
*  Yes, I could have. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2751.0s)]
*  If we had done things, fought the fight on my terms, you know, I'm fighting him. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2753.0s)]
*  I make him sprawl desperately. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2758.0s)]
*  Now, bang, I make it hard on him. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2759.0s)]
*  Bang, land some shots on him. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2760.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2762.0s)]
*  You know, in control from there. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2763.0s)]
*  You know, not letting him lock onto my arm and then go down to the ground with him, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2765.0s)]
*  because when we hit the ground, it didn't. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2769.0s)]
*  There was like. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2771.0s)]
*  For him to pull me to the ground, for you to pull somebody to the ground, you don't know how this person is going to land, right? [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2772.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2777.0s)]
*  He doesn't know how he's going to land and that creates this certain space that's created with that. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2778.0s)]
*  Because I willingly went down with him. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2782.0s)]
*  That was not the case. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2784.0s)]
*  I fell down into position just like he did, and he was able to lock even tighter on my arm. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2786.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2791.0s)]
*  You know, just like little things like that, like little small things that I don't think anybody else really thinks about, you know, that are huge. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2792.0s)]
*  And I noticed them and I adjust them. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2800.0s)]
*  That's why it was like seemed like it's like leaps and bounds. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2802.0s)]
*  But really, it's just a small adjustment, small realization, small adjustment. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2805.0s)]
*  Don't do this. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2809.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2810.0s)]
*  Did when when that happened in that fight, like we were worried about your arm like your arm got fucked up. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2811.0s)]
*  How bad was it? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2818.0s)]
*  I was dislocated. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2820.0s)]
*  It was a clean dislocation. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2822.0s)]
*  No torn tendons, no broken bone. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2823.0s)]
*  Oh, that's great. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2825.0s)]
*  Yeah. It was basically best case scenario. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2826.0s)]
*  Best case scenario for sure. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2828.0s)]
*  Best case scenario. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2830.0s)]
*  Did you ever watch when Frank Mir broke Tim Sylvia's arm? [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2831.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2838.0s)]
*  Snapped it at the forearm. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2839.0s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2841.0s)]
*  That's worst case scenario. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2843.0s)]
*  I thought it was broken. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2845.0s)]
*  I thought it was broken. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2847.0s)]
*  Whenever I was in the case. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2848.0s)]
*  So that's why I'm not like everybody in the world. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2849.0s)]
*  I thought it was broken. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2851.0s)]
*  Whenever I sat back, it was almost like a line you could see. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2852.0s)]
*  Like, you know what I mean? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2856.0s)]
*  Where it was look like just like a break across, you know. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2857.0s)]
*  But I guess not. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2861.0s)]
*  That was just the arm. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2862.0s)]
*  That's my elbow and the bone just hanging out on the other side. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2863.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2868.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2869.0s)]
*  So it was. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2870.0s)]
*  And then like I was like, like, yeah, I was good. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2871.0s)]
*  I went and stood up and everything. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2873.0s)]
*  I heard you got on my coach saying that you needed to get me up out of here. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2874.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2878.0s)]
*  That was. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2879.0s)]
*  What did I say? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2880.0s)]
*  My coach is like, oh, you need to get him to FI. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2881.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2883.0s)]
*  I thought it was broken. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2884.0s)]
*  Well, you got to get him to the hospital. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2885.0s)]
*  I got it. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2886.0s)]
*  So I had to pay his respects for everything. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2887.0s)]
*  For now me going and standing up for the decision. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2889.0s)]
*  That was me paying my respect back to the game. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2893.0s)]
*  And then for, you know, just I had to do it. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2895.0s)]
*  It was just something that I owe that I owe to the game to do. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2899.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2902.0s)]
*  They did. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2903.0s)]
*  They did want to. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2904.0s)]
*  They did want to immediately like, but no, I'm like, no, I'm gonna go ahead. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2905.0s)]
*  I'm gonna stand right. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2907.0s)]
*  You know, something I had to do. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2908.0s)]
*  You know, I had to, I had to feel that I had to go through that, you know, and that's kind [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2909.0s)]
*  of like what that was. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2913.0s)]
*  Even me sitting on the ground, like. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2914.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2916.0s)]
*  That was me. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2917.0s)]
*  That was me realizing me accepting the count of it. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2918.0s)]
*  I was me taking the count of it. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2920.0s)]
*  It is right there. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2921.0s)]
*  Yeah, it does. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2922.0s)]
*  You know, that's a strong perspective that you have that you just accepted that you took [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2923.0s)]
*  that loss like a champion. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2927.0s)]
*  You know, that's one of the hardest things to do is to take a loss with grace. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2929.0s)]
*  Take a loss with dignity. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2932.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2933.0s)]
*  You know, and know that this is part of the learning process. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2934.0s)]
*  You win or you learn. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2937.0s)]
*  And sometimes you learn when you win and sometimes you lose and it's a big lesson. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2938.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2942.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2943.0s)]
*  That's exactly how I approach it. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2944.0s)]
*  I agree a thousand percent. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2945.0s)]
*  And from that, I just took that and just learned from it. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2947.0s)]
*  It's funny how you see like MMA math just doesn't work. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2951.0s)]
*  It just doesn't work because like you see Johnny Walker fights Paul Craig and takes [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2954.0s)]
*  him out early. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2960.0s)]
*  Jimmy Jimmy Crew beat Paul Craig, beat Paul Craig. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2961.0s)]
*  And then we went and had we went and had our fight. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2964.0s)]
*  That was the main thing about I was like I was like I was happy about getting the crew [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2967.0s)]
*  fight because he had beat Paul Craig. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2972.0s)]
*  So it was like I feel this coming. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2974.0s)]
*  Anyways, getting into the ground, you know, and things like that. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2976.0s)]
*  And I really I really wanted to go in and dominate and dominate in that fight. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2979.0s)]
*  But I wanted to do it under my terms. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2983.0s)]
*  I wasn't just going to go in and let him just grapple me. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2984.0s)]
*  We're going to hit the ground. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2987.0s)]
*  We're going to hit the ground under my terms. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2988.0s)]
*  And, you know, what happened, what happened happened. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2989.0s)]
*  Then, yeah, the Johnny Walker thing. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2993.0s)]
*  But the thing was, you know, Paul Paul Paul solid, bro. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=2995.0s)]
*  Me on me. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3001.0s)]
*  Anytime, anytime he and Paul in the same place, he got he got drinking a dinner on me. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3002.0s)]
*  You know, but the Vulcan fighting Vulcan Uzumar fight exposed a lot. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3006.0s)]
*  You know, it exposed a lot. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3014.0s)]
*  And it exposed that that that my man's got a he got to learn how to his wrestling, getting you to the ground and then trusting and stand up. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3015.0s)]
*  And I honestly I think Paul Craig has good pretty good stand up. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3025.0s)]
*  If whenever he if he's confident, he actually trust it. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3030.0s)]
*  He's just something whenever he gets in there, he just don't trust or believe in it. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3033.0s)]
*  You're going to take some hits. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3036.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3037.0s)]
*  But he don't he's got to trust in the technique while while he's got to trust in the technique. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3038.0s)]
*  While while still, you know, I mean, understanding that I think he comes from being a specialist to sometimes because he's a specialist on the ground. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3044.0s)]
*  Yeah. And so stand up just doesn't really feel like his thing, whereas you you're an overall guy. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3051.0s)]
*  You know, you're striking as your strong suit, but you you you do everything you don't. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3057.0s)]
*  I mean, you're stand up. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3062.0s)]
*  Also, every fight starts standing up, which is just a big advantage for the striker. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3063.0s)]
*  Right. Especially if you get good takedown defense. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3068.0s)]
*  You know, like for a grappler, there's this this thing where you've got to get this right to the ground. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3071.0s)]
*  And you're standing with the guy and he just keeps chopping away at your legs and hitting you and chopping away. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3075.0s)]
*  And every day and your power bar keeps going down. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3079.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's what that's the thing. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3082.0s)]
*  Just because of the sheer size of Johnny Walker, I figured that'd be a hard that would be a hard thing. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3085.0s)]
*  Hard match up for for Paul, because I know Paul wants to get it to the ground. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3091.0s)]
*  Right. And I know Johnny has explosive nasty power. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3096.0s)]
*  I mean, look what he did to my arm just for me catching the kick. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3099.0s)]
*  Yeah, he did that. That wasn't him throwing a kick and me blocking it. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3102.0s)]
*  That wasn't him throwing a kick. And I just I was like, I just like caught it, like just barely, barely tapped it. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3105.0s)]
*  My arm swole up. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3111.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, like, dude, it's got some power. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3113.0s)]
*  He's got crazy power. He's got some crazy power. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3115.0s)]
*  And he knocked out Khalil Roundtree. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3117.0s)]
*  I was like, Jesus. Yeah. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3119.0s)]
*  Short elbow. Yeah. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3121.0s)]
*  That was the one fight that I was worried about. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3123.0s)]
*  If you actually look whenever we whenever he whenever I first hit him and I hit him with those shots and he tried to grab me, tried to push me against the cage all the way across, you see immediately where my hands went. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3127.0s)]
*  Right to the biceps. My hands went immediately to the biceps. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3138.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're not doing this. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3142.0s)]
*  No, it's dangerous. He's knocked a few people out with that, I believe. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3145.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3149.0s)]
*  That's like one of his that's one of the things he's nice with. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3150.0s)]
*  Just a little short elbow. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3152.0s)]
*  He's so dangerous. That was that was crazy, too. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3154.0s)]
*  That was I mean, look how he does it so tight. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3156.0s)]
*  I mean, amazing. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3159.0s)]
*  He's using leverage. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3161.0s)]
*  He's using the leverage of his height. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3163.0s)]
*  So he's coming down. He's just heavy and tall and just drops his weight. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3165.0s)]
*  When he did that celebration though and dropped down and did the worm, blew his shoulder out. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3169.0s)]
*  I was like, what happened? [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3173.0s)]
*  I remember I was interviewing him. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3175.0s)]
*  I was like, is your shoulder OK? He's like, no, no, it's not. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3177.0s)]
*  The adrenaline was still pumping through so he didn't know how bad it was. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3181.0s)]
*  Crazy that he did that on a celebration. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3184.0s)]
*  Destroyed his shoulder. Giant ass scar on his shoulder now. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3187.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how much that affects him still, if whether or not he's OK. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3191.0s)]
*  You know, because fighters, they'll have like a thing where there's forever that arm's compromised and they're still fighting and they're still winning. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3195.0s)]
*  But they don't have full power in that arm anymore. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3203.0s)]
*  It took a while for me to, for my arm to be alright. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3206.0s)]
*  Like fully, fully alright. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3210.0s)]
*  Crazy how that did it. That falling down and doing the worm did it. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3212.0s)]
*  Like right there. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3218.0s)]
*  Oh, because he slapped. He slapped. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3220.0s)]
*  Right there he slapped. He blew his fucking left shoulder out. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3222.0s)]
*  And now he's got it. Yeah, right there. Pop. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3225.0s)]
*  Now he's got a giant fucking scar on his left shoulder. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3228.0s)]
*  He's being goofy. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3231.0s)]
*  They all have hurt themselves doing some stupid shit. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3233.0s)]
*  Who didn't tear? [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3236.0s)]
*  Terrence heard himself celebrating his debut. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3238.0s)]
*  His debut when he when he knocked out when he knocked out for Vol. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3243.0s)]
*  Did he hurt himself? He jumped on the cage and hurt his knee. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3248.0s)]
*  Oh, that's right. That's right. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3251.0s)]
*  That's right. He blew his knee out. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3253.0s)]
*  We got to do it. We might have to do a list. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3255.0s)]
*  We might have to do a list of that. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3259.0s)]
*  Who injuries during celebrations. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3263.0s)]
*  Yeah, look at that. He's like, I hurt my knee. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3266.0s)]
*  That is so crazy that he did that. That's right. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3268.0s)]
*  I forgot about that. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3270.0s)]
*  Yeah, Terrence McKinney is a dangerous dude, too. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3272.0s)]
*  That's a guy who goes all out quick. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3275.0s)]
*  He comes at you. That guy comes at you. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3277.0s)]
*  He's got to work a little a little more finessing because the flying knee, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3280.0s)]
*  the flying knee that he gets caught with, it's just like a product of just his instinct being just to wrestle. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3285.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3293.0s)]
*  So whenever they charge, they make a fast one, they charge towards him and it kind of gets his head away or he doesn't see. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3295.0s)]
*  First thing he thinks like he feels the momentum coming in. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3300.0s)]
*  Like Ben Askren and Mosperdahl. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3303.0s)]
*  Yeah, like that. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3305.0s)]
*  That instinct is hard to shake. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3306.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3308.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3309.0s)]
*  The instinct of a specialist. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3311.0s)]
*  Footwork. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3313.0s)]
*  When you look at like the landscape and the light heavyweight division, like what fights are intriguing for you right now? [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3314.0s)]
*  Like, intriguing in what way? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3322.0s)]
*  Intriguing like this is the guy I want to get in there with. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3327.0s)]
*  In that way, like pretty much everybody at the top presents different challenges. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3330.0s)]
*  You know, everybody has their own different challenge. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3335.0s)]
*  I think Blahovic would be a good striking and mix-up challenge. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3337.0s)]
*  Machamad is a good mix-up challenge, but I think he's got to come more of a heavier wrestling type thing. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3342.0s)]
*  Yuri's a striking challenge, so that'd be a flowing striking challenge at that because he just flows. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3351.0s)]
*  I'm good with flowing. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3356.0s)]
*  I like to be creative and do things that flow. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3358.0s)]
*  He's so herky-jerky. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3360.0s)]
*  It's a very unusual way he moves. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3362.0s)]
*  He's like everything's like his hands are down, he's switching stances. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3364.0s)]
*  But I understand that though. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3368.0s)]
*  I understand that movement. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3370.0s)]
*  I understand that type of fighting, you know, just trying to be loose to be fast. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3371.0s)]
*  Be fast. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3376.0s)]
*  It's like water. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3377.0s)]
*  Be water. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3378.0s)]
*  The whole thing like be water is just trying to flow and crash. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3379.0s)]
*  You know, just be loose, loose, loose, and then bang, crash and hit. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3381.0s)]
*  You know, that's essentially the same thing that I'm doing. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3385.0s)]
*  You know, it's just I'm a little more technical. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3388.0s)]
*  You know, I try to stay a little more tight and I try to keep more options open for myself. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3391.0s)]
*  I mean, if that makes sense. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3397.0s)]
*  So has the UFC given you some sort of a timeline on when your first defense would be? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3399.0s)]
*  No, I think it's kind of hard for them to do that at the time, right? [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3405.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3408.0s)]
*  It's because Yuri's hurt. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3409.0s)]
*  Makhamed and Yan fought to a draw so they don't feel like they, I mean, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3410.0s)]
*  I don't really see them giving the title shot to one over the other. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3415.0s)]
*  Rackard just still hurt, I believe. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3418.0s)]
*  You got Smith who hurt his leg and technically lost. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3421.0s)]
*  But he was supposed to be a backup though with you and Glover, right? [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3427.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3431.0s)]
*  But then he missed weight. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3432.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3433.0s)]
*  Which is as a backup, man, I don't want to make weight. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3434.0s)]
*  You know, like making weight for each big fellow. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3438.0s)]
*  He's a big fellow. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3440.0s)]
*  He's a big dude. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3441.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's a big boy. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3442.0s)]
*  Like for him to make 205 is probably quite a struggle. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3443.0s)]
*  He probably should have gave him more time too. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3446.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3448.0s)]
*  You know, as soon as like some of you like, this is the fight and then you got him, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3449.0s)]
*  you should backup fighter then. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3453.0s)]
*  I don't think he knew until like a couple of weeks later. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3455.0s)]
*  So he didn't have as much time. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3458.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's not good. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3460.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3462.0s)]
*  So do you think it'll probably be Yuri if Yuri recovers in time? [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3463.0s)]
*  Yeah, if Yuri recovers in time. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3468.0s)]
*  Maybe July? [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3470.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3471.0s)]
*  That's what I want, International Fight Week. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3472.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the big one. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3473.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3474.0s)]
*  You mean Yuri, you know, Connor and Chandler? [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3475.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3478.0s)]
*  I think Connor and Chandler has to happen later than that though. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3479.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3482.0s)]
*  Yeah, because Connor has to enter the USADA training, the testing pool. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3483.0s)]
*  So I think that's six months. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3491.0s)]
*  I think you have to be in that testing pool for six months before you can fight. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3493.0s)]
*  So we're in February. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3497.0s)]
*  So I don't think July would work. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3499.0s)]
*  I think it's going to take a little bit more time than that, if I'm guessing. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3501.0s)]
*  I think they have to fight in like September or something. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3505.0s)]
*  So here we are in February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3508.0s)]
*  September's seven months. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3513.0s)]
*  I think he has to be in the testing pool for six months. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3515.0s)]
*  Right, well, you've got to be... [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3520.0s)]
*  If it's six, it's either six or more. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3523.0s)]
*  If it's more than six, that's crazy because they're hosting the Ultimate Fighter together. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3526.0s)]
*  It makes sense that they would try to set something up, a big fight for September or October, [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3530.0s)]
*  or maybe even November. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3534.0s)]
*  Madison Square Garden. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3536.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a big one. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3537.0s)]
*  It might be that one, which makes sense. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3539.0s)]
*  Well, that's why it makes sense to get sweet dreams in there for International Fight Weeks. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3542.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3545.0s)]
*  To be ready for Madison Square Garden. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3546.0s)]
*  The question is whether or not Uri can recover from catastrophic shoulder injuries. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3548.0s)]
*  That's a catastrophic injury. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3552.0s)]
*  He had major shoulder surgery. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3554.0s)]
*  I don't know exactly the extent of the injury, but I know the UFC doctor said it was the worst shoulder injury he had ever seen, [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3556.0s)]
*  which is a lot. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3563.0s)]
*  That dude's seen a lot of shit. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3564.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3566.0s)]
*  So if he says that, that's a big fucking deal. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3567.0s)]
*  Pretty bad. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3569.0s)]
*  So, you know, shoulders are very tricky. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3570.0s)]
*  It's such a weird joint. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3572.0s)]
*  It moves in so many different ways that an injury can... [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3574.0s)]
*  You've got to really rehabilitate that correctly, and it takes a long time. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3577.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was coming off a...I think I had a partial tear in my labrum after the Santos fight. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3581.0s)]
*  The second round, he actually dumped me. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3588.0s)]
*  He asked when he got that takedown, he kicked me on the body, he got that takedown, he dumped me. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3591.0s)]
*  He actually dumped me on my shoulder. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3594.0s)]
*  So he did a little bit of damage. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3596.0s)]
*  So I got to understand how much it actually takes for a shoulder to fully heal. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3599.0s)]
*  Did you have to get shoulder surgery? [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3604.0s)]
*  I didn't have to get surgery or anything done on it, but it took a while for it to heal. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3607.0s)]
*  Just rehabilitation? [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3613.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3614.0s)]
*  Did you do stem cells? [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3615.0s)]
*  No, I just did physical therapy. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3616.0s)]
*  If you ever get in that situation again, get ahold of me. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3617.0s)]
*  All right. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3620.0s)]
*  We'll connect you to some stem cell places. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3621.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3623.0s)]
*  A lot of guys are going... [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3624.0s)]
*  Kamaru just went down to Columbia. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3625.0s)]
*  A lot of guys are going to do that bioaccelerator place down in Columbia and getting stem cells. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3627.0s)]
*  It'll really help your recovery, especially for injuries. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3632.0s)]
*  It cuts the time down. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3636.0s)]
*  I think somebody just came up to me and often said they got a place down somewhere down south. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3638.0s)]
*  We have a place we work with in Austin. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3646.0s)]
*  We have a place we work with in Austin that helps a lot of guys come into Austin and get stem cells here. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3648.0s)]
*  And that's a great option too if you want to stay in the States too. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3654.0s)]
*  But they can do stuff in other countries that they can't do in the United States. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3658.0s)]
*  It's in Columbia and there's a great place, the CPI in Tijuana. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3661.0s)]
*  There's a great place in Panama that Dr. Neil Reardon runs. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3666.0s)]
*  And the laws there are different. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3669.0s)]
*  The laws of the United States, for whatever reason, you can make all sorts of reasons for why they can't do it. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3671.0s)]
*  None of them are good. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3677.0s)]
*  But they have a lockdown on what you're allowed to do here in the United States, even though it's highly effective. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3678.0s)]
*  And even though you're dealing with injured people, that really should have every option available to them. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3684.0s)]
*  Especially when some of these options have proven to be effective. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3689.0s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3693.0s)]
*  I'm just now learning all the proper things and things like that to take care of my body. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3695.0s)]
*  That's one of the unfortunate things about coming in late and learning things late. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3700.0s)]
*  That's definitely one of the things I end up into. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3707.0s)]
*  Because this is part of the job. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3711.0s)]
*  You're going to get banged up. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3713.0s)]
*  You're going to have things happen to you. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3714.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're in the destroying bodies business. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3717.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3719.0s)]
*  On the main thing though, Yuri ideally would be the fight that I would want. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3723.0s)]
*  Just because I think that's the better sell. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3728.0s)]
*  And that's the fight that I think a lot more people want to see. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3732.0s)]
*  I don't think people are really big on watching modern man fight right now. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3735.0s)]
*  He's good. He's a good fighter. He's a great fighter. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3739.0s)]
*  The problem with a fight like that. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3742.0s)]
*  A fight like that puts a bad taste in people's mouths. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3744.0s)]
*  It's not his fault. It's just the way they match up. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3747.0s)]
*  And then the decision, the fact that it was a draw. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3750.0s)]
*  Because I watched it again, I still don't think it was a draw. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3755.0s)]
*  It was very close. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3759.0s)]
*  Because you have won it. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3760.0s)]
*  I had Ankalayev win it. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3761.0s)]
*  Because I thought Ankalayev won the first round. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3763.0s)]
*  Although it was very close. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3765.0s)]
*  I thought he did too. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3767.0s)]
*  But then you've got to give credit to Bohovic for those kicks. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3768.0s)]
*  Because he had fucked that leg up. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3771.0s)]
*  Bad. Both of them. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3773.0s)]
*  And he just goes shin to shin with dudes. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3775.0s)]
*  He just goes, let's try it out. Let's go shin to shin. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3777.0s)]
*  Let's see how you feel. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3779.0s)]
*  And they say, your legs don't work like they used to before. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3781.0s)]
*  That dude's dense. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3783.0s)]
*  I mean, you see the power that guy carries. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3785.0s)]
*  He must be dense as fuck. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3787.0s)]
*  I bet his bones are just like fucking wood. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3789.0s)]
*  He's just dense. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3791.0s)]
*  And when he goes, crack, shin to shin with guys. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3793.0s)]
*  That's crazy confidence. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3795.0s)]
*  Just kicking another dude in the shins. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3797.0s)]
*  There's a dude named Malapet. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3800.0s)]
*  I think it's a technique to how he does it. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3801.0s)]
*  Oh, for sure. Yeah, for sure. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3803.0s)]
*  He knows the spot on his shin. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3804.0s)]
*  But it's just very impressive that he does that. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3807.0s)]
*  And he's just so good at Muay Thai. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3810.0s)]
*  And so good in that fight at doing that. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3813.0s)]
*  But then the wrestling. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3816.0s)]
*  He got taken down by the wrestling. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3817.0s)]
*  But that's a great adjustment by Magomed. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3820.0s)]
*  I mean, he's a real world class fighter. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3823.0s)]
*  He is. I think he's legit. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3825.0s)]
*  All those guys from Dagestan. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3828.0s)]
*  That is a hard spot in the world, man. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3829.0s)]
*  There's some fucking killers coming out of that spot. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3831.0s)]
*  I mean, they hungry. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3835.0s)]
*  They hungry. They got a lot to fight for. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3837.0s)]
*  They got a lot to fight for. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3839.0s)]
*  And a lot of those guys, I think they have this advantage in that they're very religious. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3840.0s)]
*  So with their Islamic religion, they don't drink. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3844.0s)]
*  They don't party. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3847.0s)]
*  No girls, no nothing. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3848.0s)]
*  Just food and training and fights. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3849.0s)]
*  And that focus. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3852.0s)]
*  I know Jamal's like, what? [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3853.0s)]
*  Where would I be going? [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3856.0s)]
*  Where would I be? [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3858.0s)]
*  Where would I be? [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3861.0s)]
*  If only, if only. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3864.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know, man. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3866.0s)]
*  You gotta enjoy yourself a little bit. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3868.0s)]
*  I think so too. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3870.0s)]
*  I mean, a lot of the greats enjoyed themselves. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3872.0s)]
*  I mean, hey, I did all that shit. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3874.0s)]
*  Look at me now. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3877.0s)]
*  Look at me now. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3880.0s)]
*  Bang, headshot. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3882.0s)]
*  Yeah, look at me now. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3885.0s)]
*  Shout out to Leon. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3886.0s)]
*  Yeah, shout out to Leon. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3887.0s)]
*  That's a great fight, huh? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3888.0s)]
*  The rematch? [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3889.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3890.0s)]
*  Ooh, that's intriguing. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3891.0s)]
*  I see. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3892.0s)]
*  Leon, bro, Leon is dangerous for the same reason. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3893.0s)]
*  I feel like that made me great. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3896.0s)]
*  He knows what to do, when to do it. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3899.0s)]
*  Now, yeah, he's like, some of the things he does, the way he times it and is like on point, it's like an instinct. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3903.0s)]
*  He's good, bro. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3913.0s)]
*  Oh, he's good. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3914.0s)]
*  He's really good. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3915.0s)]
*  He's so good. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3917.0s)]
*  He's one of the most impressive guys I've ever seen hitting pads. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3918.0s)]
*  You see Leon hit pads? [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3921.0s)]
*  Pull up a video of Leon working the pads. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3923.0s)]
*  His technique is so sharp, so sharp in the fluidity of his combinations. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3926.0s)]
*  You're like, that's a world class striker. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3933.0s)]
*  And that set up that he did with Kamaru, he shows him the hand and then lands that left high kick. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3937.0s)]
*  The kick was textbook, bro. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3942.0s)]
*  Textbook. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3943.0s)]
*  Textbook. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3944.0s)]
*  Textbook. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3945.0s)]
*  Textbook perfect. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3946.0s)]
*  I mean, you watch him with his movement and his pad work. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3947.0s)]
*  That's his understanding of where to be. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3951.0s)]
*  That little palm right there, that's his understanding, checking where to be. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3953.0s)]
*  He's one of the most smooth guys that's ever fought in the UFC in terms of combinations and striking and just everything he does is perfect. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3959.0s)]
*  His technique in his stand up is just perfect. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3968.0s)]
*  And then the fact that he took Kamaru down, took him down the first round, got full mount. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3971.0s)]
*  Took his back. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3977.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3978.0s)]
*  He was on his back for what? [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3979.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3980.0s)]
*  About two minutes. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3981.0s)]
*  Yeah, dominated that round on the ground. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3982.0s)]
*  Who the fuck saw that coming? [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3984.0s)]
*  That was nuts. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3986.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's nuts. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3987.0s)]
*  And it's going to be interesting to see. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3988.0s)]
*  And now also he's felt Kamaru, he's felt that wrestling, felt that power. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3990.0s)]
*  And had a situation where he was down in that fight and realized that he had won the first round. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3995.0s)]
*  So his adjustments had to be made. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=3999.0s)]
*  And then Kamaru knowing that he had the fight won if he just avoided that kick. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4002.0s)]
*  He had the fight won. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4006.0s)]
*  He was ahead on the cards. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4007.0s)]
*  That's the thing though, right? [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4008.0s)]
*  That's going to give Leon a weapon to actually have to threaten. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4009.0s)]
*  Because he's going to have to respect that kick. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4012.0s)]
*  So that's already a change in the fight. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4014.0s)]
*  And he's going to have to respect everything else too. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4017.0s)]
*  Because Leon, it's not just the kick. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4019.0s)]
*  He's got hands. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4020.0s)]
*  He's got hands. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4021.0s)]
*  He's got knees. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4022.0s)]
*  He's got elbows. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4023.0s)]
*  He's got everything. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4024.0s)]
*  And he's got the fluidity of his combinations. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4025.0s)]
*  It's just the best in the division. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4028.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's sharp, man. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4031.0s)]
*  But you got Kamaru who's a fucking nightmare, man. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4033.0s)]
*  Especially coming up, that's one of the things that I remember. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4037.0s)]
*  I talked about it frequently. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4040.0s)]
*  I was like, no one is calling that guy's name. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4042.0s)]
*  No one. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4044.0s)]
*  Everybody's talking about, I want to fight this guy. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4045.0s)]
*  No one said. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4047.0s)]
*  And then Kamaru Usman, if you're looking for a fight, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4048.0s)]
*  There was none of that. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4052.0s)]
*  There was none of that. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4053.0s)]
*  He knew. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4054.0s)]
*  This is how, you got to understand this about Kamaru. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4056.0s)]
*  This is how good, he's testament to how good he is, right? [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4060.0s)]
*  He won the first, Leon won the first round. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4065.0s)]
*  And for the next better of three rounds, you knew exactly what he was about to do to you. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4067.0s)]
*  And you couldn't stop it. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4074.0s)]
*  Couldn't stop it. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4075.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4077.0s)]
*  It took a perfect setup at the end to bring it home. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4079.0s)]
*  Because we all knew he was just going to push him up into the cage and just punch on him. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4084.0s)]
*  And the crazy thing about Kamaru, Kamaru has destroyed knees. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4088.0s)]
*  His knees are fucked up, man. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4093.0s)]
*  Yeah, I see him. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4095.0s)]
*  He moves a little bit. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4097.0s)]
*  It's kind of like his angles aren't really sharp on the turn. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4098.0s)]
*  Well, he can't move good. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4101.0s)]
*  He's in constant pain. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4102.0s)]
*  He fights in pain. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4103.0s)]
*  His knees are so fucked up that he walks downstairs backwards. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4105.0s)]
*  Damn. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4109.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4110.0s)]
*  That fucked up in a world champion. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4111.0s)]
*  He was so fucked up that he told me that he had to walk on the grass like he was next to the sidewalk. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4112.0s)]
*  The sidewalk hurt too much. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4117.0s)]
*  So he'd walk on the grass. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4119.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4122.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4123.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4124.0s)]
*  And then still to go in and compete at that level. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4125.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4127.0s)]
*  Trying out how you train. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4128.0s)]
*  If you look at the difference between the musculature in his legs and the musculature in his upper body, it's a drastic difference. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4129.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4134.0s)]
*  I think a lot of that is because of the destroyed knees. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4135.0s)]
*  If you look at the way he grapples a lot of his wrestling, his wrestling is done with upper body. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4137.0s)]
*  He doesn't wrestle with it. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4141.0s)]
*  He doesn't grapple with his legs. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4142.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4143.0s)]
*  It's amazing that some, and he throws a lot of kicks. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4144.0s)]
*  It's amazing that a guy who's hurt like that can compete. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4147.0s)]
*  Those low kicks. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4150.0s)]
*  Low kicks. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4151.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4152.0s)]
*  He'll throw a high kick occasionally. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4153.0s)]
*  You know? [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4155.0s)]
*  Like I think he threw some high kicks in the Colby Covington fight. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4156.0s)]
*  I mean, he's just, he's fucking dangerous. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4159.0s)]
*  Dangerous. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4161.0s)]
*  His mind is the thing that is most dangerous about him. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4162.0s)]
*  Because to have the ability to overcome that kind of pain, like he's in, his cartilage is fucked. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4165.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4170.0s)]
*  So he's like everywhere he walks, every step, constant pain, everything constant pain. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4171.0s)]
*  He just believes he's the guy. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4175.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4177.0s)]
*  He just believes he's the guy. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4178.0s)]
*  He believes he's just better. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4179.0s)]
*  And he just, I believe he marched forward with that belief. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4180.0s)]
*  And that's how he's been getting through that and everything. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4183.0s)]
*  Plus adrenaline is. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4188.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4189.0s)]
*  Like you done MMA fight? [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4190.0s)]
*  No, kickbox though. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4192.0s)]
*  Kickbox. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4193.0s)]
*  So you know the adrenaline whenever you like, especially in an MMA fight, dog, that adrenaline is nuts. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4194.0s)]
*  Like, even the Paul Craig, like my own, my own, my farm, like I didn't feel it like that. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4201.0s)]
*  But the minute you get back there to the back and that adrenaline's gone, he's in tough times. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4206.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4214.0s)]
*  You see guys walking out of there, walking out of the locker room and like, oh, oh, oh. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4215.0s)]
*  Limping all of a sudden. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4221.0s)]
*  You know, he's walking, he's walking, he's walking fine. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4222.0s)]
*  He's all hype and everything like that. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4224.0s)]
*  You know, he's. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4226.0s)]
*  The crazy thing is the calves. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4227.0s)]
*  The calf kick has changed everything. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4229.0s)]
*  It's so wild that this one kick that was always available. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4232.0s)]
*  Always. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4236.0s)]
*  All of a sudden over the last few years, it's become like a primary weapon. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4237.0s)]
*  Nasty. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4240.0s)]
*  Like Adesanya in Pahetta, he said that he fucked up his leg in that first round. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4241.0s)]
*  Like Israel said part of the problem was I couldn't move. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4245.0s)]
*  He got my leg. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4248.0s)]
*  Even though Israel looked like he was fine, it's just because he's a champion because he knows how to hide it and he knows how to keep moving. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4249.0s)]
*  But he's like that leg was just compromised from too many, those chopping low kicks. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4256.0s)]
*  He just chopped, chopped, chopped. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4260.0s)]
*  I was. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4262.0s)]
*  He got me with the leg with them with them and whenever we whenever we fought and then the fight, they didn't feel like, you know, I mean, they didn't really feel like after the fight. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4263.0s)]
*  Oh, you know, maybe like the last one, maybe one of the last ones, it was like a stinging, like more like a little stinging feeling. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4272.0s)]
*  But yeah, but that's the thing. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4278.0s)]
*  Once you see something's working, people are going to start taking it. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4281.0s)]
*  People are like, there's a lot like that's what that's what made me realize like other people that study study the fights and study things like I do because people start to implement those things. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4284.0s)]
*  They'll start implementing more and more and more and more like people are going to eventually people are going to start implementing the jab more and more and more. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4294.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I'm wondering how many people that you saw that Khalil roundtree fight where he sidekick that thing. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4302.0s)]
*  I'm not a fan of that one either. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4307.0s)]
*  It's like I get it. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4309.0s)]
*  It's it's there. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4310.0s)]
*  It should be used because it is it is a real technique. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4312.0s)]
*  Well, that's the case. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4315.0s)]
*  And why can't we just punch in the back of the head then? [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4316.0s)]
*  I think you should be able to. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4318.0s)]
*  I really do. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4320.0s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense to me that you can't hit in the back of the head. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4321.0s)]
*  Well, they will like to that because it's a weak spot. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4323.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4326.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4327.0s)]
*  It's almost like me hitting the nut. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4328.0s)]
*  You know. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4329.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4330.0s)]
*  But I mean, to a certain degree. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4331.0s)]
*  Isn't your whole fucking head a vulnerable spot? [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4334.0s)]
*  I guess there's maybe a vulnerable spot that's more vulnerable in the back end. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4336.0s)]
*  But shouldn't that be protected? [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4338.0s)]
*  You don't really have a way to defend the back of your head, though. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4340.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4342.0s)]
*  But then if someone gets that spot, you're fucked. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4343.0s)]
*  I mean, that's that should be what it is because that's reality. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4345.0s)]
*  Do you remember the early days? [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4348.0s)]
*  I don't know if you ever saw this, but Hensel Gracie had a fight early on in one of those. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4350.0s)]
*  I mean, that's that's what it is. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4354.0s)]
*  I mean, that's that's what it is. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4356.0s)]
*  I mean, that's that's what it is. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4358.0s)]
*  And he had a fight early on in one of those organizations that didn't go anywhere like World Combat, something or another. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4360.0s)]
*  And he took this guy down who was a judo guy. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4368.0s)]
*  He took him down, got his back. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4371.0s)]
*  And in those days, you could elbow the back of the head and Hensel just got his back and just boom, boom, boom. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4373.0s)]
*  And then put him out. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4382.0s)]
*  And then I think he strangled him after he elbowed him in the back of the head. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4383.0s)]
*  But it's like having that ability to hit that spot. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4386.0s)]
*  That's really it's also if we're this is the sport of fighting. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4390.0s)]
*  That's a fucking real vulnerability. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4395.0s)]
*  The back of the head is a real the idea that a guy can cover up like this and you have to go around that. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4397.0s)]
*  And there's one glaring spot in the back of the head exists. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4402.0s)]
*  And doctors will tell you, oh, you can't get hit there. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4406.0s)]
*  And he's like, but there's a lot of times where it's OK to get hit there. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4408.0s)]
*  Like, here's one head kicks. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4411.0s)]
*  A lot of head kicks. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4413.0s)]
*  They wrap around. They catch you right at the back of the head. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4415.0s)]
*  We know this. We know this with wheel kicks. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4417.0s)]
*  We know this with roundhouse kicks, hooks happens all the time. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4419.0s)]
*  And it's OK. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4423.0s)]
*  And then but some people like I don't I don't know. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4425.0s)]
*  I think it's more so frowned upon on the ground. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4428.0s)]
*  I don't know why. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4430.0s)]
*  I don't I mean, I guess that it's more dangerous. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4432.0s)]
*  But then that's also a good spot to hit then. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4436.0s)]
*  When John Jones finished Alexander Guston in a second fight, those were the way those shots to the back of the head. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4440.0s)]
*  Let's look at it. Let's look at it. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4446.0s)]
*  I'm there's a lot of times we guys are in the middle of the heat of battle. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4448.0s)]
*  They let that aside. Yeah. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4452.0s)]
*  Right. Some of them definitely when someone's raining down blows and the guys covering up and turning, some of them are going back there. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4454.0s)]
*  I just don't I get a doctor. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4462.0s)]
*  A doctor, I understand if they would come to me and say, no, this is a particularly vulnerable area. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4465.0s)]
*  OK, well, then stop fighting. You shouldn't be fighting. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4469.0s)]
*  No one should fight then because your whole head's a vulnerable area. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4471.0s)]
*  You get wheel kicked in the temple. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4474.0s)]
*  All right. That's a vulnerable fucking area. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4476.0s)]
*  This little skinny ass piece of bone that protects the side of your head and someone swings a giant heel and it comes slamming right into their car. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4478.0s)]
*  Hey, sir. You did that. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4485.0s)]
*  I think it was Ben Lagerle. He fought. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4487.0s)]
*  Even when he fought him back in the days, like one of my sparring partners, like my first sparring partner. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4489.0s)]
*  I first came in. He did a wheel kick. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4494.0s)]
*  His leg like wrapped around and bow, like in the back of the head. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4497.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a bad one. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4501.0s)]
*  That happens all the time. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4504.0s)]
*  I remember when Edson Barboza wheel kick Terry Edam in the head. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4505.0s)]
*  Oh, man. Yeah. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4509.0s)]
*  Stiff. And we were talking in the commentary saying that Terry's got to do something to take more chances, but he could risk getting knocked out. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4512.0s)]
*  Yeah, risk getting knocked out. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4519.0s)]
*  Yeah. Right when it happened. It was crazy. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4521.0s)]
*  I think that might have been the original. Andy's coming. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4524.0s)]
*  The stiff. Yeah. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4527.0s)]
*  When guys go stiff like that, that's a hard way to come back from. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4531.0s)]
*  Those are rough knockouts, especially Terry Edam never really came back from that fight. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4534.0s)]
*  Never was world class again after that fight. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4539.0s)]
*  Things like a fear. It's got to be like some type of fear. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4542.0s)]
*  And this is what Kamaru's going to have to deal with whenever he fights Leon. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4545.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4548.0s)]
*  I mean, it's all right. Like I think he lost one fight, right? [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4549.0s)]
*  Yeah. One fight early in his career. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4552.0s)]
*  You got choked. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4554.0s)]
*  You got choked. Right. All right. It's cool. You made an injury. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4555.0s)]
*  So you make mistakes. You know, you can get choked by getting knocked out, bro. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4558.0s)]
*  Like, it's got to be different. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4563.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's very different. It's very different. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4566.0s)]
*  I believe it is too. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4569.0s)]
*  There's a moment in Kamaru's fight when in his career where Damien Maia got his back and it was standing. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4570.0s)]
*  Damien Maia had him clinched up against the cage and he was getting his back and the referee separated him. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4577.0s)]
*  And I was like, what the fuck did you just do? [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4582.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4585.0s)]
*  It changed the course of the fight. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4586.0s)]
*  To this day, I'm fast because this was Damien Maia basically in his prime as a welterweight. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4587.0s)]
*  Kamaru coming up. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4593.0s)]
*  And there was this moment where Damien has Kamaru's back. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4595.0s)]
*  He's like hanging on him. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4599.0s)]
*  He's clinched up against me. He's a very good position. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4601.0s)]
*  And the referee separates him. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4604.0s)]
*  And I remember at home going, no, what the fuck are you doing? [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4605.0s)]
*  How are you separating this? [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4610.0s)]
*  And that's always a weird thing when they choose to separate someone or separate, stand up or like, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4612.0s)]
*  because he was telling me that I needed to work when I was on top of Glover and I'm hitting him with elbows. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4619.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4625.0s)]
*  He was like, he's like, you got to work. You got to work Jamal, which is crazy. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4626.0s)]
*  Why do they say that? [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4631.0s)]
*  Why do they say that? That doesn't make any sense to me. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4632.0s)]
*  You work when you need to work. If you were on top and you were making it. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4635.0s)]
*  I was being heavy. I was being heavy. I'm just zapping. I'm like, you know what I mean? [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4638.0s)]
*  Basically kind of crushing this diaphragm at this point. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4643.0s)]
*  It's like, oh, you got to work. You got to work. I'm like, damn. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4646.0s)]
*  Why? You are working. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4649.0s)]
*  I'm not allowed to cook the stew? [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4650.0s)]
*  Yes, cook the stew. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4652.0s)]
*  I'm not allowed to turn the pressure cooker off, go make the rice? [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4653.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4657.0s)]
*  You know? [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4658.0s)]
*  You should be able to pick when you go, when you're in a dominant position, when you're controlling the guy. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4659.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4664.0s)]
*  And this, I hate standups. I feel like if someone could take you down and hold you down, that is on you to get up. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4665.0s)]
*  Like having a stand up just because the crowd's bored. Tell them to go watch baseball. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4671.0s)]
*  That's boring as fuck. And people watch it every week. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4676.0s)]
*  You just got to protect the product, Joe. You got to protect the product. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4678.0s)]
*  I don't believe that. I believe the guys like you will always rise to the top. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4681.0s)]
*  I'm going to get up. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4684.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4685.0s)]
*  I'm going to get up. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4686.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4687.0s)]
*  I feel like if you didn't have that option available, guys would be very focused on getting up. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4688.0s)]
*  Instead of thinking that they could just wrap their guard around you and wrap their head around you and just hope for a stand up. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4693.0s)]
*  Because sometimes referees will do that. They get a guy in a guard position and no one's doing anything the guy can't do. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4698.0s)]
*  They'll stand him up. They'll stand him up. Stand him up. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4704.0s)]
*  And the crowd cheers and everybody thinks, that's a good job. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4706.0s)]
*  I go, no, you've ruined the flow of the fight. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4709.0s)]
*  You can go at your pace. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4711.0s)]
*  Yeah. And if you're on top and if guys got you in his guard and he's squeezing and holding on to you, how long can you do that? [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4713.0s)]
*  Can you do that for the full five minutes? You might not be able to. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4719.0s)]
*  You might relax a little and then that person's going to get out. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4722.0s)]
*  And that's what the sport's all about. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4725.0s)]
*  The sport's all about you being able to figure out how to get out of a bad position and get to a better position. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4726.0s)]
*  And someone being able to control you and minimize the damage that they take and maximize the amount of damage they could put on you. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4734.0s)]
*  That's what it's all about. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4740.0s)]
*  So if you have a stand up, then you have a subjective person. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4741.0s)]
*  It's up to them to decide. Stand them up. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4745.0s)]
*  I've seen people get stand up and side control, which is crazy. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4748.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen that too. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4751.0s)]
*  Crazy. It takes too long to get to that spot and you only have five minutes to work it around. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4752.0s)]
*  I don't like stand ups at all. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4758.0s)]
*  I think that's one of the things we should get rid of. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4761.0s)]
*  And people are like, oh, it's going to make it boring. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4765.0s)]
*  Wrestlers are going to take people down. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4767.0s)]
*  Figure out how to not get wrestled. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4768.0s)]
*  Figure out how to get up. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4770.0s)]
*  There's ways to get up. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4771.0s)]
*  It's not like once a guy gets you mount, no one in the world can get up. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4772.0s)]
*  That's bullshit. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4776.0s)]
*  Everybody can get up. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4777.0s)]
*  It's just scrambles. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4778.0s)]
*  Things have to happen. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4779.0s)]
*  That's part of the puzzle that makes martial arts presents. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4780.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that I was only on the ground on top of Glover for what? [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4783.0s)]
*  Maybe like a minute and a half and a minute and a half. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4787.0s)]
*  How many elbows did I hit him with for me to actually get a warning to be stood up? [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4790.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4794.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4795.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4796.0s)]
*  That was just wild to me. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4797.0s)]
*  And then like the whole. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4798.0s)]
*  He I think it was the fourth round, the fourth round when I was standing up and I was actually [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4800.0s)]
*  starting to lay on, lay it on him a little bit. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4806.0s)]
*  He told him, I think he told him maybe three or four times. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4808.0s)]
*  Like, like you got to show me some Glover. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4813.0s)]
*  You got some. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4815.0s)]
*  At what point are you going to stop it, bro? [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4816.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4817.0s)]
*  It was close. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4818.0s)]
*  Because it was like, what brings back the Izzy fight? [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4819.0s)]
*  Do you think the Izzy fight should have been stopped? [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4822.0s)]
*  When he had him on the ground? [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4824.0s)]
*  When he had him. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4825.0s)]
*  No, whenever he was. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4826.0s)]
*  Oh, when Izzy at the end. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4827.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4828.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4829.0s)]
*  I think that one is a good stoppage because that scissor knee was coming. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4830.0s)]
*  You know, like he was hurt. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4835.0s)]
*  I mean, Izzy got caught clean. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4837.0s)]
*  I think he got caught. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4839.0s)]
*  I think he got caught clean. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4840.0s)]
*  But I think also his leg was compromised because he actually got his leg checked. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4841.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4845.0s)]
*  You got a kick checked right before that, which is why. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4846.0s)]
*  So he's already stumbling. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4849.0s)]
*  It's that same left leg that got chopped up in the first round. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4850.0s)]
*  Yeah, but his leg, but he was moving like he was weaving. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4852.0s)]
*  And I'm not going to say it was a bad stoppage or whatever like that. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4856.0s)]
*  But like if you believe that should have been stopped. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4858.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4861.0s)]
*  The global fight should have definitely been stopped. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4862.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4864.0s)]
*  That's the thing about being subjective about a referee being able to decide. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4865.0s)]
*  And some of them are great. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4869.0s)]
*  Like Herb Dean very rarely makes a bad call. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4870.0s)]
*  He's the best. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4873.0s)]
*  He's very good at it. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4874.0s)]
*  And some guys are just real quick with the trigger. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4875.0s)]
*  They'll stop a fight when the guy's just kind of a little rocked. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4878.0s)]
*  You know, Herb, we work for that stoppage on Santos. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4881.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4884.0s)]
*  Yeah, I had to work for that one. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4885.0s)]
*  I was tired. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4887.0s)]
*  I was tired. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4888.0s)]
*  I think I hit him about like 50 something punches before we got in there, before we got the wave off. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4889.0s)]
*  But after that fourth round, though, like you seen when they pour the water, they pour the water on my head. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4898.0s)]
*  But that was all his blood. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4907.0s)]
*  Like I wasn't bleeding from my head at all. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4909.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4912.0s)]
*  Like it was like he had like chunks like my cousin said he's like he's got he had like chunks of his like chunks of his flesh and stuff. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4913.0s)]
*  Where my hair and things like that. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4919.0s)]
*  It's like, bro, what do you got to do? [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4921.0s)]
*  There it is. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4924.0s)]
*  Oh, that's his blood. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4925.0s)]
*  That's like you see like a little white chunks of stuff. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4926.0s)]
*  Oh, that's so crazy. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4929.0s)]
*  If you look, if you actually look at my mouth, I was like, I was like, where does it come? [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4934.0s)]
*  I looked down. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4937.0s)]
*  I see it. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4938.0s)]
*  I'm like, where's that coming from? [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4939.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4940.0s)]
*  That's coming from my bleeding. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4941.0s)]
*  Blood in your hair. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4942.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4945.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4946.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4947.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4948.0s)]
*  It's it's it. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4949.0s)]
*  That is interesting. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4950.0s)]
*  But that's why the importance of good referees is it's so significant because if you get a bad referee, you know, like, you know, some guys, they'll have like a personal beef with a certain referee like a referee going to stop to fight too early. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4951.0s)]
*  And they're like, I don't want him calling my fights. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4964.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't I don't I don't get that person. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4965.0s)]
*  I just say how I feel about the situation. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4967.0s)]
*  I move on from it. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4969.0s)]
*  You know, like Mark did what he did. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4970.0s)]
*  He did what he did like her. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4974.0s)]
*  They do what they do. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4975.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, I'll say how I feel about this situation or whatever. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4976.0s)]
*  And then from there, we on to the next. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4980.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4982.0s)]
*  You know, it is weird, though, that that's a factor in world championship fights. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4983.0s)]
*  The subjective factor of when to stop a fight. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4987.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4990.0s)]
*  When to stop a fight, when to tell a guy to work, when to stand a person up. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4991.0s)]
*  Bro, that cut was nasty, dude. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4994.0s)]
*  Like if you're going to stop it for any cut, it's pretty I thought it was going to be that one. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=4997.0s)]
*  It was his eye was like his eye, little brow was like completely like just. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5001.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5005.0s)]
*  Just torn apart. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5006.0s)]
*  Well, I believe that in a lot of other places, they would stop that fight. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5007.0s)]
*  Like if you had a smaller commission, like maybe Arizona or something like that. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5011.0s)]
*  I wasn't Brazil. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5014.0s)]
*  Right. Right. Right. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5015.0s)]
*  And also maybe something like New York. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5017.0s)]
*  You know, New York does not have I mean, New York has a nice history now with the UFC. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5020.0s)]
*  But when we first went there, there was not a real history of MMA in professional New York because it was corrupt. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5025.0s)]
*  They kept MMA out of New York forever. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5031.0s)]
*  It was look at that cut. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5034.0s)]
*  Dude, that's a nasty cut. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5036.0s)]
*  That's a nasty ass cut. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5038.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5040.0s)]
*  But he could still see out of that eye as opposed to. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5042.0s)]
*  He was still at one point, he was wiping blood out of his eyes. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5045.0s)]
*  Right. But it wasn't closed off. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5050.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5051.0s)]
*  Like the Davidson figurado fight when Brandon Moreno caught him with that left hook and the eye just swole up and closed. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5052.0s)]
*  Even in Brazil, they're like, we got to stop this fight. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5058.0s)]
*  I think that's part of the reason. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5060.0s)]
*  Another part of the reason why they didn't want to stop the fight also was because right before that, they had just stopped the Davidson figurado fight for injury. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5062.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5071.0s)]
*  You know, so you stop another title fight, take another title from a Brazilian off an injury. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5072.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5077.0s)]
*  That's an interesting thing. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5078.0s)]
*  I wonder if that factors in. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5080.0s)]
*  Like if one referee makes a quick call in an early stoppage and then the next fight, the referee thinks about that and goes, you know what? [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5081.0s)]
*  I'm not going to let this one. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5089.0s)]
*  I'm going to let this one go a little longer. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5090.0s)]
*  I'm not going to hear those boos because those boos are real. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5092.0s)]
*  When the crowd booze and you're in there by yourself with your sneakers on going, oh, everybody's mad at me. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5094.0s)]
*  But to Clover's credit, though, I had to technically pour it on him. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5099.0s)]
*  I had to pour it on him for range setups and things like that. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5104.0s)]
*  I was never able to just sit and just power shot and just start cleaning his clock. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5106.0s)]
*  You know, because I tried. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5111.0s)]
*  God damn it, I tried. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5113.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5114.0s)]
*  But he just, yeah, bro. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5115.0s)]
*  So experienced. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5117.0s)]
*  So experienced and so resilient. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5118.0s)]
*  But that, again, that's about as close to a stoppage as you're ever going to get without it being stopped. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5120.0s)]
*  When you were on top of him and blasting him, I thought it was over. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5126.0s)]
*  That's what I thought. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5129.0s)]
*  I thought whenever he kept, I thought whenever he kept in the fourth, whenever I was landing on him and then, especially after he threw it, I slipped counter with the knee, started hitting him, landed a couple more upper cuts. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5130.0s)]
*  You know, I'm like, I was expecting him to jump in between us and wave it off. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5143.0s)]
*  You know, but then like whenever I seen he did and then it's like, all right, now he's fighting for undead because he's trying to grime, trying to clinch up with me and things like that. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5147.0s)]
*  It's like, all right, I'm not going to burn my load. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5154.0s)]
*  Now just start just picking shots, hitting them with, start hitting them with clean shots. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5157.0s)]
*  Well, Glover never loses his composure to win. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5162.0s)]
*  Never loses it. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5167.0s)]
*  Even after you head kicked him, when you had him stumbling and rocking, he's still, he's still like right here, focused. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5168.0s)]
*  He's not, you never see like, oh shit in his eyes. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5174.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5177.0s)]
*  Even when Gustafson took him out, you know, he was still in there trying, but just Gustafson just paced him up. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5178.0s)]
*  That was Gustafson, I think, finest performance when he stopped Glover. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5186.0s)]
*  I mean, he just, what a video game combination he hit him with. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5189.0s)]
*  That was like you're playing the ultimate fighter video game. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5193.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5196.0s)]
*  Perfect, three perfect upper cuts. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5197.0s)]
*  It was amazing. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5200.0s)]
*  That was an amazing performance. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5201.0s)]
*  Then he slipped. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5202.0s)]
*  He got hit with those three upper cuts and still threw a counter left hook. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5203.0s)]
*  Still threw a counter left hook. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5207.0s)]
*  He had to slip and then bang, counter him again. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5208.0s)]
*  Like, that's crazy. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5212.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5214.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5215.0s)]
*  Upper cuts are meant for people to be taken, bro. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5216.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5218.0s)]
*  That's a nasty punch. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5219.0s)]
*  Remember when Rumble caught Glover with that upper cut? [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5220.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5222.0s)]
*  Sent his two flying. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5223.0s)]
*  Rumble, rest in peace. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5224.0s)]
*  Rest in peace, Rumble. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5225.0s)]
*  What a great guy. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5227.0s)]
*  Put him down with one punch. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5228.0s)]
*  Oh, what the power that Rumble had was crazy. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5229.0s)]
*  And the fact that that guy carried that power all the way up into heavyweight when he was a welterweight. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5232.0s)]
*  He was never 170. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5236.0s)]
*  He was 170 for three minutes. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5237.0s)]
*  He made the weight, Joe. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5240.0s)]
*  Yeah, he made the weight. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5243.0s)]
*  He made the weight, Joe. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5244.0s)]
*  All right. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5245.0s)]
*  He looked like a skeleton. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5246.0s)]
*  He looked like one of the people from Coco whenever he did it. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5247.0s)]
*  He made it. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5252.0s)]
*  One of these, man. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5253.0s)]
*  For real. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5254.0s)]
*  Yeah, for real. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5255.0s)]
*  One of these sugar skulls. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5256.0s)]
*  Yeah, man, when I saw him in between fights once, he was so big. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5257.0s)]
*  I said, Anthony, how big are you? [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5265.0s)]
*  And he goes, I'm about 230. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5266.0s)]
*  I go, what the fuck is going on? [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5267.0s)]
*  How are you going to lose 60 pounds? [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5270.0s)]
*  And that was the real struggle when he decided to go up to middleweight and he missed middleweight. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5273.0s)]
*  Remember, he fought Vitor, missed middleweight, and then came back as a light heavyweight contender [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5278.0s)]
*  and one of the fucking scariest guys in the division. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5284.0s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5286.0s)]
*  That guy was silly. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5287.0s)]
*  Wild. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5288.0s)]
*  Just realized he can't do that to his body anymore and he course corrected. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5289.0s)]
*  But I wonder about those guys. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5293.0s)]
*  He developed an illness. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5295.0s)]
*  I don't know if it was related and unfortunately died. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5298.0s)]
*  But those guys that cut that much weight, how much of a toll is that taking on their body? [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5301.0s)]
*  It's got to be taking a heavy, heavy toll. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5306.0s)]
*  Johnny Walker, Johnny Walker's got to be 240 pounds before he starts that guy. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5308.0s)]
*  He's got to be. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5313.0s)]
*  He's so big. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5314.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, man. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5315.0s)]
*  I don't know, bro. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5320.0s)]
*  It's a heavy toll. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5321.0s)]
*  I think somebody said something like he rehydrated back up to like 237 or something like that. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5322.0s)]
*  I believe it. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5328.0s)]
*  He looks like it. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5329.0s)]
*  When you're standing next to him, like how the fuck are you 205 pounds? [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5330.0s)]
*  He's huge, dude. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5333.0s)]
*  I'm just looking like, all right, where's the skinny part? [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5334.0s)]
*  Not the skinny. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5336.0s)]
*  So what does it say? [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5337.0s)]
*  248 pounds one week after his fight. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5338.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5342.0s)]
*  But look at him at even 248. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5344.0s)]
*  He's not fat at 248. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5346.0s)]
*  Big dude, man. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5349.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's interesting because he's actually been saying he's going to go up to heavyweight and he's talking about fighting. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5351.0s)]
*  He's got the right body type, bro. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5357.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5358.0s)]
*  He's got the right body type. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5359.0s)]
*  He's got the right body type. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5360.0s)]
*  He pounds between the two. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5361.0s)]
*  You know who else is a big dude? [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5362.0s)]
*  That Jolton Almeida dude is huge. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5363.0s)]
*  Oh, he's big. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5365.0s)]
*  He's a big boy. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5366.0s)]
*  He's big. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5367.0s)]
*  He's a big boy. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5368.0s)]
*  He's heavyweight. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5369.0s)]
*  He'd be like another. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5370.0s)]
*  I heard him a while. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5372.0s)]
*  They actually offered me to fight him. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5374.0s)]
*  At 205? [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5377.0s)]
*  On the 21st of January. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5378.0s)]
*  Yeah, he weighs like what? [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5381.0s)]
*  Like 220-ish as he fights as a heavyweight. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5383.0s)]
*  He's on the lighter side of heavyweight. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5386.0s)]
*  I don't know, dude. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5388.0s)]
*  I know if he makes it to 205, that's about the same size as Johnny Walker. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5389.0s)]
*  It's like the same body build and things like that. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5393.0s)]
*  So I think that actually would be exciting. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5397.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5400.0s)]
*  It'd be a good one. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5401.0s)]
*  Is there any fighters from the past that you look at and go, man, I wish I was in his time? [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5402.0s)]
*  I wish I could fight him. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5408.0s)]
*  There's a lot of the greats I would have liked to test myself against. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5411.0s)]
*  For me, it just looks like it's just a test. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5415.0s)]
*  I would have liked to fight Anderson Silva at his prime, at his peak. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5420.0s)]
*  I would have liked to fight John Jones at his peak. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5423.0s)]
*  I would have liked to fight Chuck Liddell, Liotta Machida, Brock Lesnar. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5428.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5438.0s)]
*  I would have fought Brock. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5439.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5440.0s)]
*  Bro, I don't, bro. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5441.0s)]
*  Like, go to Rome, bro. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5443.0s)]
*  Brock's a big name. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5445.0s)]
*  He's done a lot of things like that. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5447.0s)]
*  But I just don't think Brock was that good. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5449.0s)]
*  I just think he was big. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5453.0s)]
*  He was definitely big. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5455.0s)]
*  I don't think he was skilled. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5457.0s)]
*  I think he was big. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5458.0s)]
*  Well, you know, an example of that is when Brock fought Alistair. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5459.0s)]
*  When, before USADA came around, when Alistair was on all the Mexican teams. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5464.0s)]
*  On the good stuff. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5472.0s)]
*  He was on the good stuff. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5473.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5474.0s)]
*  See, find that fight. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5475.0s)]
*  Brock Lesnar versus Alistair over him. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5476.0s)]
*  Look at the size of the ream. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5478.0s)]
*  That was a fully juiced ream. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5482.0s)]
*  The fully juiced ream was the scariest heavyweight that ever existed. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5484.0s)]
*  Look at that motherfucker. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5487.0s)]
*  His eyebrows got muscles. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5489.0s)]
*  If there's any man that got fucked by USADA, it's Alistair over him. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5491.0s)]
*  I think Alistair over him, when he was, like, allowed to supplement with whatever the fuck you could do. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5496.0s)]
*  He was so, because he was a world class kickboxer. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5502.0s)]
*  K-1 Grand Prix champion. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5506.0s)]
*  The type of stand up skills that he had, man. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5508.0s)]
*  Brock nervous as shit right here. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5511.0s)]
*  Of course he's nervous. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5512.0s)]
*  Of course he's nervous. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5513.0s)]
*  Because he's got to try to take this dude down. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5514.0s)]
*  And the dude's as big as him. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5515.0s)]
*  And Alistair was also a European champion in Abu Dhabi. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5517.0s)]
*  He won the European trials. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5521.0s)]
*  You know, Alistair over him, he fucking guillotined Vitor Belfort. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5523.0s)]
*  Alistair over him can submit people too. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5526.0s)]
*  Very good ground game. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5528.0s)]
*  He got to be able to, like, you got to be able to go from knowing to be a boxer to knowing to be a wrestler. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5530.0s)]
*  He don't know that. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5535.0s)]
*  Yeah, this was such a good fight too. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5537.0s)]
*  It was such a good fight. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5538.0s)]
*  This was such a good fight because Alistair at this time was in his prime, entered into the UFC, and had great takedown defense. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5539.0s)]
*  Look, stops that single, and his stand up was unparalleled. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5546.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, by the time he fought Francis, he was already battle worn and, you know, off the sauce and, you know, fighting natural. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5550.0s)]
*  It's just not the same guy. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5558.0s)]
*  I would have loved to seen Francis in his prime versus this Alistair. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5560.0s)]
*  Because they're literally the same size. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5564.0s)]
*  Francis is just a natural freak. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5566.0s)]
*  Francis is like some of the best genetics I've ever seen in the heavyweight division. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5568.0s)]
*  He's the perfect heavyweight. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5573.0s)]
*  Especially since there's a weight class. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5574.0s)]
*  Look at how he's putting it on him, man. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5576.0s)]
*  I mean, it's so skillful. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5578.0s)]
*  The way he frames off there. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5579.0s)]
*  He sets up that left kick to the body. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5580.0s)]
*  Oh, that liver kick. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5582.0s)]
*  Come on, man. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5583.0s)]
*  And Alistair's liver kick, that's a totally different level. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5585.0s)]
*  If you've never been hit by a world class kickboxer like that. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5588.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5591.0s)]
*  He's one of my absolute favorite fighters to watch in his prime. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5593.0s)]
*  Alistair in his prime was the fucking man. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5596.0s)]
*  He really was. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5599.0s)]
*  And people forgot, man. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5601.0s)]
*  The ones that shake your organs. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5603.0s)]
*  You take a couple steps and all of a sudden it just... [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5605.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5607.0s)]
*  I remember when he fought Bret Rogers in Strikeforce. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5608.0s)]
*  And the moment he hit him with a leg kick, like whoomp. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5611.0s)]
*  You see Bret Rogers' eyes like, oh, boy. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5614.0s)]
*  This is a different thing. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5617.0s)]
*  This is a totally different thing. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5619.0s)]
*  Like you're in there with an elite world class kickboxer. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5621.0s)]
*  So you would have fought him at Heavyweight. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5625.0s)]
*  No. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5628.0s)]
*  Brock Lesnar. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5629.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5630.0s)]
*  I would have fought him at Heavyweight. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5631.0s)]
*  Yeah, you like that fight. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5632.0s)]
*  He was like 265, something like that. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5633.0s)]
*  He ain't going to do nothing. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5635.0s)]
*  He'll just try to dry him. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5636.0s)]
*  He's always going to do. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5638.0s)]
*  He'll try to get a little frisky on me. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5643.0s)]
*  When you think about your career, do you have like a timeline [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5645.0s)]
*  when you want to get out of the game? [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5649.0s)]
*  I juggle with it right now. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5652.0s)]
*  I'm just having fun with it. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5655.0s)]
*  Whenever I feel like people still want to see me [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5657.0s)]
*  and I still have things that I want to do or accomplish, [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5660.0s)]
*  I'm going to keep doing it. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5666.0s)]
*  Whenever I feel like I can't be at that level that I'm accustomed to being at, [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5667.0s)]
*  I find something else for me to do. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5675.0s)]
*  So right now you're just concentrated on excellence, [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5677.0s)]
*  just being the best you can be. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5679.0s)]
*  Do you have a thing that you want to do when you're done fighting? [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5681.0s)]

*  If you looked at overall a fighter's marketability, [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5732.0s)]
*  there's your ability inside the cage that's already there, [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5737.0s)]
*  but then there's the personality. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5741.0s)]

*  Honestly, it kind of started whenever. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5774.0s)]
*  I was a little kid. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5777.0s)]
*  I don't know if anybody else ever played with their toys, [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5778.0s)]
*  but what I would do with my toys, my action figures, [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5781.0s)]
*  it'd be a whole situation. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5784.0s)]
*  All right, this is the boss level on this floor right here. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5785.0s)]
*  They're on this floor. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5789.0s)]
*  They're doing this. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5790.0s)]
*  He got you, girl. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5791.0s)]
*  Then we do fight scenes, [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5792.0s)]
*  but the fight scenes always had to lead up to something. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5793.0s)]
*  So I was kind of making stories and making things up in my head already, [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5795.0s)]
*  but just doing it with toys. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5800.0s)]
*  Like, dang. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5801.0s)]
*  I wonder if I could ever create these into movies. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5802.0s)]
*  I thought of this as a little kid, [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5805.0s)]
*  so that's just something I've always wanted to do. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5807.0s)]
*  What movies are you into? [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5809.0s)]
*  What's the kind of shit that you really like? [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5810.0s)]
*  A bunch of different things, like action, drama, thrill, scary movies. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5812.0s)]
*  I kind of watch it all. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5818.0s)]
*  I double it all. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5819.0s)]
*  So that's the thought of concentrating on later in your career. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5821.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5826.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5827.0s)]
*  Yeah, you could do that. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5828.0s)]
*  100%. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5829.0s)]
*  You know what else you could do? [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5830.0s)]
*  You could do a podcast. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5831.0s)]
*  And you could do that now. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5832.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to get that going. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5834.0s)]
*  You could totally do that now. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5836.0s)]
*  It's a great marketing tool, [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5837.0s)]
*  because you could talk about fights after the fights happen. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5839.0s)]
*  You could make a breakdown of what you think could happen. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5843.0s)]
*  And just talk shit. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5846.0s)]
*  Just get together with your friends and fuck around. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5847.0s)]
*  It's so easy to do, and you've got a perfect personality for it. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5851.0s)]
*  And it's a great marketing tool, too. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5854.0s)]
*  All that stuff is great for your overall profile. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5856.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've been meaning to do it a buck or down the road. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5860.0s)]
*  But then I come in and I see studios, like, yo, set up. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5863.0s)]
*  And I'll be like, I don't have it set up. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5866.0s)]
*  Maybe I should get it first. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5868.0s)]
*  Well, I started out in my living room on a laptop. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5870.0s)]
*  It was just me and my friends fucking around. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5873.0s)]
*  It was the most low tech setup ever. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5875.0s)]
*  Web camera, fucking ethernet cable into the laptop. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5878.0s)]
*  It was so low tech. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5883.0s)]
*  You just need to start. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5885.0s)]
*  And then eventually you're like, you know what? [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5886.0s)]
*  We need better chairs. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5888.0s)]
*  Eventually you'll be like, you know what? [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5889.0s)]
*  We need a real table that has microphones [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5891.0s)]
*  that come out of the table. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5893.0s)]
*  You know what? [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5894.0s)]
*  We need some lighting in this room. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5895.0s)]
*  This room's got bullshit lighting. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5896.0s)]
*  You know what? [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5897.0s)]
*  We need better cameras. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5898.0s)]
*  And then it'll all... [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5899.0s)]
*  It'll start to add up. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5900.0s)]
*  Yeah, it'll start to add up. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5901.0s)]
*  Yeah, but the most important thing is just to start doing it. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5902.0s)]
*  Like, everybody thinks that they look at all these podcasts [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5905.0s)]
*  that are, like, real successful, and they go, [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5908.0s)]
*  oh, I have to have a setup like that. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5910.0s)]
*  Like, no, no, no. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5911.0s)]
*  Just got to... [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5912.0s)]
*  You set a fucking iPhone up in front of you on a table. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5913.0s)]
*  You know, and just talk to it. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5917.0s)]
*  Just talk into it. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5919.0s)]
*  You could just do it on Instagram. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5920.0s)]
*  It's not hard to do. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5922.0s)]
*  You could just start. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5923.0s)]
*  And then once you get started, people go, [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5924.0s)]
*  hey, when you doing those again? [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5926.0s)]
*  And people get excited about it, and they want to see it. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5927.0s)]
*  And then you just build. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5930.0s)]
*  Just build. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5931.0s)]
*  Just keep doing it. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5932.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5933.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to get those started. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5934.0s)]
*  That was one of the plans whenever I got back home [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5935.0s)]
*  after I got done. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5937.0s)]
*  Let me know. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5939.0s)]
*  Let me know, and I'll put it up on Instagram. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5940.0s)]
*  But you definitely could do that. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5942.0s)]
*  You definitely could do that. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5944.0s)]
*  And that's also another good source of revenue. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5945.0s)]
*  You could get more money coming in that way. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5948.0s)]
*  And, you know, if a fighter... [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5950.0s)]
*  Like, look at Chael Sonnen. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5952.0s)]
*  Chael Sonnen has done a fantastic job of doing that. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5953.0s)]
*  He breaks down fights, has his videos. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5956.0s)]
*  They're all super popular and, you know, [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5959.0s)]
*  makes that transition into commentary as well. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5961.0s)]
*  It's a smart thing to do for a fighter. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5964.0s)]
*  It really is. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5967.0s)]
*  Because everybody wants to hear perspective on this sport. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5968.0s)]
*  Because it's such... [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5971.0s)]
*  You know, you got the people that train [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5972.0s)]
*  and the people that fight, [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5974.0s)]
*  and then you got other people that just like watching. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5976.0s)]
*  And the other people that just like watching, [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5978.0s)]
*  they kind of don't know a lot of the shit that's going on. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5980.0s)]
*  And if they get an insight from a world champion like yourself [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5983.0s)]
*  who explains what this is like [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5986.0s)]
*  and explains what's wrong with this, [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5988.0s)]
*  explains why this should have been different, [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5990.0s)]
*  explains what he could have done, [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5992.0s)]
*  that's so valuable to people. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5994.0s)]
*  And so to get someone who's doing it, [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5997.0s)]
*  like, really no one right now in the championship level [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=5999.0s)]
*  is doing a podcast. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6004.0s)]

*  It's a crazy fight, yeah. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6036.0s)]
*  To go right from like 145-pound champion [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6037.0s)]
*  to the first title defense at 155 for Makhachev. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6041.0s)]

*  Nobody saw that coming. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6058.0s)]
*  I thought it was going to be a tough fight. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6060.0s)]
*  I thought it was going to be a tough fight, too. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6061.0s)]
*  He hurt him on the feet. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6063.0s)]
*  On the feet. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6064.0s)]
*  On the feet. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6065.0s)]
*  Beat him with the beat, [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6066.0s)]
*  beat him standing, and then following him to where everybody thought he would be safe [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6067.0s)]
*  at. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6070.0s)]
*  I've seen a clip of that choke that he did. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6071.0s)]
*  I know why that choke was so tight now. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6074.0s)]
*  Most people finish their head and arm triangle, they go into the elbow. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6077.0s)]
*  The bicep, yeah. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6082.0s)]
*  He went up higher. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6083.0s)]
*  He went up higher and then locked it here. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6085.0s)]
*  Tighter squeeze into it. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6089.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6090.0s)]
*  Well, I think his squeeze is just phenomenal. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6091.0s)]
*  Because if you see the way he tapped Drew Dober, too, the same sort of situation, [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6092.0s)]
*  he gets guys on the ground, and I think it's just a next-level power and squeeze. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6096.0s)]
*  Some dudes just have next-level squeeze and next-level grappling power, and he's developed [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6103.0s)]
*  that his whole life. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6110.0s)]
*  He's also enormous for 155. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6111.0s)]
*  He's about as big as you can get and safely make 155 pounds. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6114.0s)]
*  I've never seen him in person. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6118.0s)]
*  He's big. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6120.0s)]
*  He's about 190. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6121.0s)]
*  He looks to me like a welterweight. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6122.0s)]
*  Where's Volk walk around at? [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6125.0s)]
*  Can't be nearly that high. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6127.0s)]
*  Volk is 5'6". [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6129.0s)]
*  170? [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6130.0s)]
*  I think he was a big dude before. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6131.0s)]
*  He was. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6133.0s)]
*  He was a big rugby player. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6134.0s)]
*  He's got big fucking legs. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6135.0s)]
*  He's tough as shit, man. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6136.0s)]
*  He's fast as fuck. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6137.0s)]
*  Fast as fuck. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6138.0s)]
*  He's fast as fuck. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6139.0s)]
*  I realized that the Holloway fight. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6140.0s)]
*  The last one. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6142.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6143.0s)]
*  Because I was there, and I was actually watching it live. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6144.0s)]
*  Max is fast on his own, right? [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6147.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6149.0s)]
*  It's just like, bro, every time Max twitched, smallest of twitch, smallest of twitch, bang, [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6150.0s)]
*  he exploded. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6157.0s)]
*  And he beat him to the punch every time. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6158.0s)]
*  Every time. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6160.0s)]
*  Every time. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6161.0s)]
*  It was crazy, dude. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6162.0s)]
*  He's good. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6163.0s)]
*  It was a big leap up. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6164.0s)]
*  When you go to their first fight and then you go to their last fight, you see a different [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6167.0s)]
*  Volkanovsky. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6172.0s)]
*  Completely different fighter. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6173.0s)]
*  He's on a whole other level now. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6174.0s)]
*  That guy's drive, his fucking drive is on top of the food chain. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6176.0s)]
*  That's why I think he wins. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6180.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6182.0s)]
*  I think he wins. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6183.0s)]
*  You think he wins over Makachev? [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6184.0s)]
*  I think he wins. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6185.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6186.0s)]
*  That's interesting that you say that. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6187.0s)]
*  Because he's probably a heavy betting underdog, if I had to guess. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6189.0s)]
*  If I had to guess, he's at least a two to one underdog. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6194.0s)]
*  What's the betting odds for this weekend? [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6197.0s)]
*  I think if he comes out loose, loose, creative, standing out at the start, I think he catches [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6199.0s)]
*  him with something big. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6205.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6206.0s)]
*  He can either cut him open or he can put some damage on him early. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6207.0s)]
*  That changes the fight. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6211.0s)]
*  I think that's the main thing he's got to do is put some type of damage on him and get [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6212.0s)]
*  respect out the gate. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6216.0s)]
*  I think he can do it. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6217.0s)]
*  What do we got for the odds? [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6218.0s)]
*  They don't have it listed on the UFC set. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6219.0s)]
*  I'm going to have to check a betting site. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6220.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6223.0s)]
*  The thing about Makachev is he might be looking at him like it's an easy win. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6224.0s)]
*  Because he's been saying a lot of shit. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6232.0s)]
*  It might just be talk. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6234.0s)]
*  Hey, short man, what is short man going to do to me? [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6235.0s)]
*  He's been talking shit about him, about how he's little and the 145 pounders are a big [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6238.0s)]
*  difference between that and 155, which is true. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6244.0s)]
*  But the other thing that's true is a lot of times when guys are cutting weight to get [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6247.0s)]
*  to 145 pounds, they're diminishing their abilities. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6250.0s)]
*  You might see a better Volkanovsky at 155. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6253.0s)]
*  Even though he's the best of the best at 145, he might be doing that like comp marks. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6255.0s)]
*  Big favorite. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6261.0s)]
*  Big favorite. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6262.0s)]
*  Joking, bro. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6263.0s)]
*  What? [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6264.0s)]
*  That's a big favorite. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6265.0s)]
*  Damn, we're not allowed to bet on fights. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6266.0s)]
*  So he's plus, I know that sucks. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6267.0s)]
*  Plus 290 from Makachev and Volkanovsky is 375. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6269.0s)]
*  Minus 375. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6275.0s)]
*  What does Volkanovsky further finish? [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6276.0s)]
*  Oh, that's got to be like a fucking, that's got to be crazy odds. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6278.0s)]
*  I could find that somewhere too. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6282.0s)]
*  That's got to be crazy odds. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6283.0s)]
*  What is going on in the Yair Rodriguez? [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6285.0s)]
*  Let me see what the odds are. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6287.0s)]
*  I think he catches him, especially like that right hand is fast and sharp. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6288.0s)]
*  Fast. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6293.0s)]
*  I think that left hook is sharp and nasty too. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6294.0s)]
*  So I think if he hits him with one of those and then he starts working the legs, that's [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6297.0s)]
*  a long night for Islam. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6302.0s)]
*  It is. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6304.0s)]
*  However, I mean I know MMA math doesn't really work, but if you look at Brian Ortega's fight [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6305.0s)]
*  with Volkanovsky, Brian Ortega almost finished him twice. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6311.0s)]
*  He got so close to that mounted guillotine. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6315.0s)]
*  That's a Jiu Jitsu based guy. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6318.0s)]
*  Yes, but same techniques. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6320.0s)]
*  Top game, but top game pressure and crushing with that guillotine is what Ortega almost [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6322.0s)]
*  got him with. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6328.0s)]
*  I don't know if Volkanovsky survives if Makachev gets him in that same exact spot. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6329.0s)]
*  What? [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6334.0s)]
*  What's going on? [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6335.0s)]
*  The website, a different website, I would not name it. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6336.0s)]
*  It's not, well, it's fine. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6339.0s)]
*  That has its odds way different. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6341.0s)]
*  Opposite almost. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6344.0s)]
*  Bet on both. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6347.0s)]
*  How is that? [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6349.0s)]
*  Go bet on both. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6350.0s)]
*  The one I checked before would have been printed maybe a couple days ago and this is updated [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6351.0s)]
*  live. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6356.0s)]
*  So maybe the betting got so far the other way that they've switched it. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6357.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6359.0s)]
*  I might have to check a third site now to see what this is because this has Makachev's [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6360.0s)]
*  favorite to win inside the distance. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6365.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6367.0s)]
*  This is also favorite to win inside five rounds. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6368.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6371.0s)]
*  Wins by submission would be the highest bet here. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6372.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6375.0s)]
*  Yes, I'll check something else. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6376.0s)]
*  Look at the draw. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6377.0s)]
*  Plus 6,600. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6378.0s)]
*  Plus 6,600. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6379.0s)]
*  It's almost always worth throwing my own a draw in case it happens. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6380.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6384.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6385.0s)]
*  Yeah, weird. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6386.0s)]
*  Damn. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6387.0s)]
*  If only, if only, 282. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6388.0s)]
*  It's more valuable than we have. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6389.0s)]
*  Fucking hate that they took away gambling. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6392.0s)]
*  I feel like you should be able to bet on yourself. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6394.0s)]
*  I would love it if you're fighting someone and we said Jamal Hill just bet a million [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6396.0s)]
*  dollars on himself. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6401.0s)]
*  Like, that adds to the fight. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6402.0s)]
*  It makes it more exciting. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6404.0s)]
*  Justin James. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6406.0s)]
*  You should be able to bet on yourself. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6407.0s)]
*  But the thing that fucked everybody up was this whole thing with that one fighter that [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6409.0s)]
*  looks like he took a dive. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6414.0s)]
*  Kross. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6415.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6416.0s)]
*  Well, Kross' corner, Kross' corner in the sky. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6417.0s)]
*  Now, now no one from Kross' team can even compete in the UFC. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6419.0s)]
*  You have to leave his camp if you want to fight in the UFC, which is crazy. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6423.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6427.0s)]
*  It's crazy because like if you can't gamble, what difference does it make where you're [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6428.0s)]
*  training? [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6431.0s)]
*  If you can't gamble, like you just made a rule that said they can't gamble. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6432.0s)]
*  So why are you telling them they can't train with this camp anymore? [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6436.0s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6440.0s)]
*  And they're saying he's suspended as a corner. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6441.0s)]
*  Okay, but what about training from that gym? [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6444.0s)]
*  You can't train from that gym? [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6446.0s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6448.0s)]
*  You can't train a guy in a way that it's an unfair advantage. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6450.0s)]
*  So what's the point? [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6455.0s)]
*  Why can't these guys from that gym, if you're going to say Kross can't corner him, fine. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6456.0s)]
*  Just influence, I guess. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6461.0s)]
*  What kind of influence if there's no gambling? [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6463.0s)]
*  If the gambling is not legal anymore, you made gambling illegal. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6465.0s)]
*  So why are you penalizing these young fighters? [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6468.0s)]
*  They don't have anything to do with that. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6471.0s)]
*  And they're coming out of this camp. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6473.0s)]
*  And you're also, what if the guy's innocent? [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6474.0s)]
*  Okay, what if it turns out because there's an investigation, what if it turns out he's [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6476.0s)]
*  innocent? [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6479.0s)]
*  You've destroyed his livelihood. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6480.0s)]
*  You've destroyed his gym. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6482.0s)]
*  You've destroyed his reputation. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6483.0s)]
*  And we don't even know what the reality of the situation is. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6485.0s)]
*  The allegations are not good. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6488.0s)]
*  The allegations appears like they knew a guy was injured. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6491.0s)]
*  They told people who was injured he was going to lose the fight and everybody bet on the [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6493.0s)]
*  opponent. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6496.0s)]
*  If that's the case, that's some dirty shit. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6497.0s)]
*  That's some dirty shit. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6499.0s)]
*  But, you know, if you want to bet on yourself or bet on your fighter, I feel like that should [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6501.0s)]
*  be good. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6506.0s)]
*  That's exciting. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6507.0s)]
*  That makes it fun. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6508.0s)]
*  You find out his brother bet $50,000 on him. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6509.0s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6512.0s)]
*  It's fun. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6513.0s)]
*  Makes it fun. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6514.0s)]
*  I like that. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6515.0s)]
*  I like fun. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6516.0s)]
*  Gambling's fun. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6517.0s)]
*  Like, if they outlawed all gambling on the UFC, I would be so upset. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6518.0s)]
*  You're just going to make bookmakers happy. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6523.0s)]
*  They're just going to do it illegally. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6525.0s)]
*  And that makes people, and not only that, bro, gambling brings people in. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6527.0s)]
*  The first thing I pulled up must have been an error because everything else has the opposite. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6531.0s)]
*  It has a mock-a-chip as a heavy favorite. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6535.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6537.0s)]
*  Well, what did the other one say? [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6538.0s)]
*  Was Volkanovsky not a heavy favorite? [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6539.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is the first thing I pulled up, is this. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6541.0s)]
*  And this must be an error. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6543.0s)]
*  They must have just switched that on accident. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6545.0s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6547.0s)]
*  So Volkanovsky is the favorite. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6548.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6550.0s)]
*  But the regular one that you just pulled up, the other site. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6551.0s)]
*  This has the site. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6555.0s)]
*  This has betting across all websites. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6556.0s)]
*  That's mock-a-chip as a 4-1 favorite, which makes more sense. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6557.0s)]
*  And you got Yair Rodriguez. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6562.0s)]
*  He's a favorite over Josh Emmett. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6564.0s)]
*  5-1 here. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6566.0s)]
*  5-1. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6567.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6568.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6569.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6570.0s)]
*  You know, another fucking great fight on that card is Jack Della Maddalena and Randy Brown. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6571.0s)]
*  That's a great fight. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6576.0s)]
*  That's a great fight. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6577.0s)]
*  It's going to be a good one. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6578.0s)]
*  That Della Maddalena is a bad motherfucker. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6579.0s)]
*  And Randy Brown is long and talented. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6581.0s)]
*  I really like that fight. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6584.0s)]
*  His nose gets me every time, bro. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6585.0s)]
*  Oh, it's fucked. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6587.0s)]
*  You don't want that nose. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6588.0s)]
*  No, I don't. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6589.0s)]
*  No. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6590.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6591.0s)]
*  That nose is smashed and never fixed. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6592.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6595.0s)]
*  But that's a hard-nosed dude, man. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6596.0s)]
*  And he's going to be fighting in Australia, which for a guy who lives there, man, that's [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6598.0s)]
*  such an advantage of not having to get on that 16-hour flight. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6605.0s)]
*  Oh. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6608.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6609.0s)]
*  That 16-hour flight will fuck up multiple days because even though you're training and [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6610.0s)]
*  you're trying to get... [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6614.0s)]
*  How hard was the flight to Brazil? [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6615.0s)]
*  It wasn't hard at all. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6617.0s)]
*  No? [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6619.0s)]
*  Going down there, we actually flew out at night, so I fell asleep before the plane even hit [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6620.0s)]
*  the... [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6627.0s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6628.0s)]
*  Before the plane even left the ground. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6629.0s)]
*  By the time I had woken up, we had already been up in the air for like five hours. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6630.0s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6632.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6633.0s)]
*  I was just like, wake up. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6634.0s)]
*  We got about four and a half hours. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6635.0s)]
*  I watched like two movies. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6636.0s)]
*  We were there. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6637.0s)]
*  And so then once you got in, do you train immediately to acclimate your body? [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6638.0s)]
*  What do you do? [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6642.0s)]
*  I just chill. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6643.0s)]
*  I chill. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6644.0s)]
*  How many days in advance of the fight did you get there? [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6645.0s)]
*  I got there Monday. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6647.0s)]
*  We left Sunday. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6649.0s)]
*  We arrived Monday morning. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6650.0s)]
*  Wow, that's not much time at all. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6651.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6653.0s)]
*  Have you ever had a fight at a heavy altitude? [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6654.0s)]
*  Not heavy, but higher. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6656.0s)]
*  I know Vegas is higher altitude than Michigan is. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6659.0s)]
*  Oh, is it though? [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6662.0s)]
*  It's like 1500. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6663.0s)]
*  Yeah, but that doesn't really factor in. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6664.0s)]
*  It would really factor in. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6667.0s)]
*  Does it? [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6668.0s)]
*  It might. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6669.0s)]
*  Did you notice it at all? [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6670.0s)]
*  I felt a little different. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6671.0s)]
*  The thing I'm thinking about is when Cain Velasquez... [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6672.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, Mexico City. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6678.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6681.0s)]
*  The Mexico City one is a rough one because Fabricio Verduem, he got there real early, [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6682.0s)]
*  like months early, and he trained in the mountains above Mexico City. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6687.0s)]
*  Fabricio did it the right way. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6691.0s)]
*  He spent a lot of time. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6693.0s)]
*  That's a guy that doesn't get the credit that he deserves. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6695.0s)]
*  I believe Fabricio Verduem should go down as one of the all-time great MMA fighters, [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6697.0s)]
*  one of the all-time great heavyweight champions. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6702.0s)]
*  If you look at all the heavyweight champions and what they accomplished, [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6704.0s)]
*  Fabricio Verduem tapped out all the legends, all the legends. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6707.0s)]
*  Tapped out Cain Velasquez, tapped out Fador, tapped out Minotauro. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6712.0s)]
*  I mean, dude, Fabricio Verduem in his prime was a motherfucker. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6718.0s)]
*  And again, that top-level jujitsu, world championship caliber jujitsu. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6724.0s)]
*  I don't think his prime lasted long enough. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6728.0s)]
*  Didn't last long enough. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6730.0s)]
*  But if you just look at his accomplishments, just by virtue of accomplishments, [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6731.0s)]
*  you have to put him in there as one of the all-time greats. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6735.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6737.0s)]
*  And when he tapped Fador, when he caught Fador in that triangle, [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6738.0s)]
*  I was like, oh, oh, oh, oh! [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6740.0s)]
*  That was crazy. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6744.0s)]
*  Now that I think about it, whose prime and heavyweight actually did last that long? [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6745.0s)]
*  Stipe. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6750.0s)]
*  Stipe is probably, if you look at the all-time heavyweight greats, [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6751.0s)]
*  outside of the UFC, outside of the UFC, you know, [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6755.0s)]
*  or outside of the UFC, you have to say Fador. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6760.0s)]
*  You have to say Fador. He's the greatest. He's the greatest. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6763.0s)]
*  Fador might be the greatest heavyweight of all time. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6766.0s)]
*  There's always going to be that thing because he didn't fight in the UFC. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6769.0s)]
*  And then there's Cain Velasquez in his prime, who was the motherfucker back. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6773.0s)]
*  He was the motherfucker. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6777.0s)]
*  But I always wonder, like, Cain Velasquez in his prime, [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6778.0s)]
*  Junior Del Santo still caught him with one punch and knocked him out. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6781.0s)]
*  What would Francis have done to him? [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6784.0s)]
*  Would he have done to him the same thing he did when they fought later? [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6786.0s)]
*  Because when they fought later, Francis clipped him once and put him out in the first round. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6788.0s)]
*  Maybe Francis would have done that his entire career. Like, maybe. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6792.0s)]
*  I remember that damn fight. That was on Fox. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6796.0s)]
*  They put one fucking fight on that entire card. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6799.0s)]
*  And he came out and got clipped in like a minute and a half. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6802.0s)]
*  And it was like, all right, see, good night, folks. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6805.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6808.0s)]
*  It was like, damn. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6809.0s)]
*  He caught him with one big punch. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6811.0s)]
*  And apparently, Cain had a really fucked up knee going into that fight. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6812.0s)]
*  He couldn't train right. And they just, they made him fight. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6816.0s)]
*  You had a fight. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6819.0s)]
*  It's like, hey, this is a big deal. It's on Fox. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6820.0s)]
*  Got to defend your title. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6823.0s)]
*  And then he goes out there with a blown out knee. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6824.0s)]
*  But then dominated him. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6826.0s)]
*  And dominated him. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6827.0s)]
*  Oh, the two rematches. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6828.0s)]
*  Two rematches, both of them. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6829.0s)]
*  They were hard to watch. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6831.0s)]
*  They weren't even close. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6832.0s)]
*  They were hard to watch. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6833.0s)]
*  They weren't even close. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6834.0s)]
*  Cain had cardio like you couldn't fucking believe. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6835.0s)]
*  That was the scary thing about Cain. Like, he never stopped coming at you. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6838.0s)]
*  It was like a Julio Cesar Chavez approach. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6842.0s)]
*  Whereas Julio Cesar Chavez, he was one of the greatest boxers of all time. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6846.0s)]
*  But he wasn't really a one punch guy. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6850.0s)]
*  He would beat the fuck out of you. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6851.0s)]
*  Just keep coming. Never tired. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6853.0s)]
*  He had combinations. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6855.0s)]
*  Always moving. Always moving. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6856.0s)]
*  I mean, I loved watching Julio Cesar Chavez in his prime. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6858.0s)]
*  But that's what Cain was like as a heavyweight. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6862.0s)]
*  No, just never tired. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6865.0s)]
*  Just constant volume. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6869.0s)]
*  Like volume you never see in the heavyweight division. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6871.0s)]
*  But still, what Francis have done to that? [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6873.0s)]
*  Like Francis has that nuclear option. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6877.0s)]
*  Which Francis? It depends on Francis at what level. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6879.0s)]
*  Stipe II. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6882.0s)]
*  That Francis. Francis when he knocks out Stipe. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6884.0s)]
*  That Francis might be the greatest heavyweight of all time. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6887.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's kind of hard. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6889.0s)]
*  Even against Cyril Gahn, right? [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6891.0s)]
*  He turned into like, he adjusted. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6893.0s)]
*  He was like, all right, you know, I'm just going to keep him and chop my legs and took him down. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6895.0s)]
*  And this is Francis with a really fucked up leg. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6899.0s)]
*  He had a torn ACL and a torn MCL going into that fight. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6901.0s)]
*  His leg was fucked up. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6905.0s)]
*  And he won with that fucked up leg. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6907.0s)]
*  Put on my master class of just grappling. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6909.0s)]
*  Without being able to do what he does best, which is strike. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6911.0s)]
*  Kind of crazy. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6914.0s)]
*  Couldn't move well on that one leg. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6915.0s)]
*  Yeah. Without the credentials, honestly, probably without... [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6917.0s)]
*  How do you say this? [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6923.0s)]
*  Like without the credentials, obviously somebody's more decorated. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6925.0s)]
*  Right. Right. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6927.0s)]
*  And things like that. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6928.0s)]
*  But if we're talking like just pure gifts, you probably have to go with Francis. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6929.0s)]
*  I can't think of a heavyweight champion across history that he couldn't beat. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6936.0s)]
*  I think the Francis that fought Stipe the second time, DC said it best. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6942.0s)]
*  DC's like, patient Francis is a scary Francis. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6948.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6951.0s)]
*  Because he was patient in that fight. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6952.0s)]
*  Jab. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6953.0s)]
*  Calculated. Yeah. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6954.0s)]
*  He started, he began at the end with a jab. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6955.0s)]
*  And his hands, man. You get clipped with one of those bombs. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6958.0s)]
*  That Alistair Overeem knockout to this day was one of the scariest knockouts I ever saw. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6962.0s)]
*  Man. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6966.0s)]
*  That shovel hook, he hit him with that left hook. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6967.0s)]
*  Yeah, bro. That was Alistair's fault though. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6969.0s)]
*  Because like, bro, you felt the first one that he missed you with. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6971.0s)]
*  And you still stood in there trying to swing with him. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6974.0s)]
*  Get out. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6976.0s)]
*  Get out. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6977.0s)]
*  Get out. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6978.0s)]
*  Get out. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6979.0s)]
*  He's sort of red just like the dude from Get Out. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6980.0s)]
*  Get him out of there. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6982.0s)]
*  Yeah. Look at that. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6984.0s)]
*  I mean, bro, he's looking at the seats behind him. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6985.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6988.0s)]
*  We call that getting your Kufi knocked off. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6989.0s)]
*  Kufi Jones. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6992.0s)]
*  Kufi Juice. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6993.0s)]
*  You see that? [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6994.0s)]
*  You see that? [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6995.0s)]
*  You see that sweat hanging? [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6996.0s)]
*  You see the beads of sweat flying off his chin? [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6997.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=6999.0s)]
*  That's Kufi Juice right there. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7000.0s)]
*  That was a crazy, crazy knockout. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7002.0s)]
*  But again, that's the thing about Francis. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7005.0s)]
*  To have that kind of power, it's such a game changer. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7008.0s)]
*  It's like what Teddy Atlas says that about Deontay Wilder. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7013.0s)]
*  That he said he's got that eraser. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7017.0s)]
*  His head and his neck were asleep, [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7019.0s)]
*  but the rest of his body was still awake. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7021.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7023.0s)]
*  In that picture. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7024.0s)]
*  When it first connects, you can see where his head goes asleep. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7025.0s)]
*  Look at the difference in Alistair's body [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7027.0s)]
*  between Alistair when he fought Brock Lesnar. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7029.0s)]
*  It's a different human being. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7031.0s)]
*  That's natural Alistair. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7033.0s)]
*  And natural Alistair, oh my goodness. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7035.0s)]
*  No. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7037.0s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7038.0s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7039.0s)]
*  Boom, that left hook. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7040.0s)]
*  Bam, and then that hammer fall. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7042.0s)]
*  Put his head down trying to blindly swing. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7043.0s)]
*  You gotta see where you're punching. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7045.0s)]
*  Wee. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7047.0s)]
*  He just stepped inside of it too. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7049.0s)]
*  That's all. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7051.0s)]
*  Alistair threw it. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7052.0s)]
*  He just kind of stepped inside of it. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7053.0s)]
*  Bang. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7055.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7056.0s)]
*  Yeah, Alistair was just, I mean he was wide open in that. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7058.0s)]
*  It's just not the same guy. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7062.0s)]
*  Not the same guy when he's not supplemented. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7065.0s)]
*  That first left miss, bro, you gotta get out. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7068.0s)]
*  Get out. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7071.0s)]
*  Get out. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7072.0s)]
*  Spin, move. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7073.0s)]
*  He changed his style. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7074.0s)]
*  Remember he changed his style? [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7075.0s)]
*  Like when he did go natural, he changed his style [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7076.0s)]
*  and started moving a lot more. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7079.0s)]
*  He was training with Jackson Winklejohn, right? [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7081.0s)]
*  Wasn't he? [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7083.0s)]
*  Cool. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7084.0s)]
*  Alistair? [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7085.0s)]
*  Alistair. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7086.0s)]
*  I think he was. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7087.0s)]
*  Pretty sure he was. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7088.0s)]
*  He was moving a lot more. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7089.0s)]
*  He was trying to out point guys. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7090.0s)]
*  Yeah, like when he fought Junior Dos Santos. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7093.0s)]
*  That was a good fight. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7095.0s)]
*  He just used a lot more movement. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7097.0s)]
*  He was just more cautious, different fighter. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7099.0s)]
*  Styles make fights, right? [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7102.0s)]
*  So that might work against one fighter, but not against the other. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7103.0s)]
*  Honestly, that should have been the approach that he took in and out, [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7106.0s)]
*  moving like that. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7109.0s)]
*  That's the approach he should have took to Francis, chop his legs. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7110.0s)]
*  For sure. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7112.0s)]
*  Chop at his legs first. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7113.0s)]
*  Try to reach you with him. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7115.0s)]
*  Try to make him reach you. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7117.0s)]
*  Don't let him catch you coming. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7118.0s)]
*  Because there you got caught coming to him. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7120.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7122.0s)]
*  Like, nah, bro. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7123.0s)]
*  And then like just a, I'm never been a fan of him. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7124.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's weird. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7128.0s)]
*  It seemed like he was just like a little tentative in that fight, [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7130.0s)]
*  like just feared of that power, just aware, hyper aware of that power. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7134.0s)]
*  But him being scared of it, he put himself right in the line to get hit with it bad, like clipped bad. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7138.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7145.0s)]
*  That Francis, like the Francis that beat Steve Bay in the second fight, [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7146.0s)]
*  I would have loved to have seen him against anybody that ever lived, [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7150.0s)]
*  including Fador in his prime, all those guys in their prime. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7153.0s)]
*  Francis was just so ferocious. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7156.0s)]
*  And anytime he touched you, you were doomed. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7158.0s)]
*  He would have blocked, you put him in the early days and he blocks a lot of dudes don't win a title. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7161.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7169.0s)]
*  A lot of dudes don't win a title. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7170.0s)]
*  They don't even get close. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7171.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7172.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, he's next level. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7173.0s)]
*  That's why I was very upset when he didn't re-sign with the UFC. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7174.0s)]
*  I'm very happy for him if he gets that giant payday. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7179.0s)]
*  If he gets a big, they're talking about him and Deontay Wilder now. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7182.0s)]
*  I read that today. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7185.0s)]
*  Talking about him and Deontay Wilder in a boxing match. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7186.0s)]
*  That would be violent. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7189.0s)]
*  It would be violent. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7190.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7191.0s)]
*  And you know, Deontay can be hit, but Deontay hits people. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7192.0s)]
*  Deontay hits hard, bro. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7195.0s)]
*  You're not talking about trying to find your equal. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7198.0s)]
*  You found him. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7200.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7201.0s)]
*  That last knockout, he had, he looked like a jab. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7202.0s)]
*  Moving away. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7205.0s)]
*  Moving away. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7206.0s)]
*  Moving away, like bink. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7207.0s)]
*  And the dude's stiff. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7208.0s)]
*  Stiff as a board. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7209.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7210.0s)]
*  He's got that gift of God. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7211.0s)]
*  It's like, he's got that gift of God. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7213.0s)]
*  It's like, when he knocked out Lewis Ortiz, like, whoo. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7215.0s)]
*  Stiff touch. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7218.0s)]
*  Just right to the forehead, blap. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7219.0s)]
*  And you see like Ortiz on the ground going, what the fuck? [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7221.0s)]
*  He hits guys and it's like they've never been hit like that before. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7225.0s)]
*  You can see the look in their eyes. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7228.0s)]
*  Only Tyson Fury. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7230.0s)]
*  He was, I don't know how he got up. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7231.0s)]
*  Like the Undertaker just sits up. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7234.0s)]
*  And then won the rest of the round. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7237.0s)]
*  Won the rest of the fight. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7239.0s)]
*  Yeah, crazy, crazy. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7241.0s)]
*  And then, you know, the rematch and then the third fight, the third fight, he got hurt [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7242.0s)]
*  real bad, you know, and Deontay clipped him perfect with the right hand. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7247.0s)]
*  You see the fat ripple through his whole body when he got hit. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7251.0s)]
*  It's like boom. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7254.0s)]
*  And the slow-mo. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7255.0s)]
*  You see it ripple all the way down to his love handles from the impact. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7256.0s)]
*  That's the kind of power Deontay has. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7259.0s)]
*  Yeah, Deontay is nasty, bro. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7261.0s)]
*  He's the greatest one-punch knockout artist in the history of the heavyweight division. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7264.0s)]
*  I think. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7268.0s)]
*  I don't think there's anybody that has greater one-punch knockout power because you're talking [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7270.0s)]
*  about a guy whose entire career was knockout wins. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7273.0s)]
*  Knockouts. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7276.0s)]
*  Only Stiverne made it to the decision and then he fucked him up in the rematch. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7277.0s)]
*  Rematch, bro, yeah. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7281.0s)]
*  Bad. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7283.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7284.0s)]
*  He had a, the way he blocked like this was just not what I would recommend for somebody [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7285.0s)]
*  punching like Deontay. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7292.0s)]
*  It's just, bro, you're just holding steel and lining up a frame for him to. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7293.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're still getting jostled by those shots. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7298.0s)]
*  Even if your hands are up like this, if he's hitting full blast on that hand, it's bang. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7300.0s)]
*  It's still rattling your skull. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7304.0s)]
*  That was one of the things that you did with Glover. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7306.0s)]
*  When Glover blocked that head kick, it didn't matter. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7308.0s)]
*  Didn't matter because it's still blasting through. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7311.0s)]
*  But that was the setup. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7314.0s)]
*  That was how I wanted it. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7315.0s)]
*  That's why I moved the way I did. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7316.0s)]
*  You know, you notice I was moving him. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7318.0s)]
*  I'm moving, moving him. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7320.0s)]
*  And then I pop a, I either I pop a jab or I just look low. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7321.0s)]
*  I just look low. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7326.0s)]
*  I just look, I was getting that little, that little look low and bang. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7327.0s)]
*  Just stick, just put the leg up, you know, look low. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7331.0s)]
*  Is that something you've been incorporating more into your game? [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7333.0s)]
*  The head kicks? [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7336.0s)]
*  Bro, the head kick, the leg, the left leg kick, head kick, body kick was the first weapon [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7337.0s)]
*  I had walking in. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7345.0s)]
*  That was the one thing I knew I could beat. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7346.0s)]
*  If you go back and you watch my first amateur fight, it's on YouTube. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7348.0s)]
*  I knocked him out with a head kick. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7353.0s)]
*  Really? [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7354.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7355.0s)]
*  Four months in a training. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7356.0s)]
*  That was six weeks. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7357.0s)]
*  Six weeks in a training? [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7360.0s)]
*  Yeah, about six to eight weeks. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7362.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7364.0s)]
*  Yeah, I knocked him out, bro. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7365.0s)]
*  Hit him, I hit him and he kind of stumbled. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7366.0s)]
*  I hit him again and then bang right off of that. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7370.0s)]
*  Boop, left. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7373.0s)]
*  Head kick came up. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7374.0s)]
*  So that's always been one of your big weapons. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7375.0s)]
*  It's always been one. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7377.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7378.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7379.0s)]
*  It's a giant weapon to have. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7380.0s)]
*  When you have guys who don't throw head kicks, it's like, man, you're missing out on just [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7382.0s)]
*  an enormous part of the game. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7386.0s)]
*  Most of the dudes who don't throw up, they can't. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7387.0s)]
*  Can't quite get the leg up there. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7390.0s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7392.0s)]
*  Hey, man, maybe you should work on that. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7393.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7394.0s)]
*  I mean, if you're in a business where people are kicking you in the head and you can't kick [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7395.0s)]
*  them in the head, that seems kind of crazy. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7398.0s)]
*  I mean, when a world championship fight is won that way, like Leon Edwards and Kamaru [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7402.0s)]
*  Usman or like John Jones versus DC, there's something about a head kick, man. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7406.0s)]
*  That is the great equalizer. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7411.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7412.0s)]
*  Because you got to deal with it the right way. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7413.0s)]
*  You can't just put it like that. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7415.0s)]
*  No, as far as timing, yeah, he got his arm up. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7417.0s)]
*  There was no way for you to block a flush, clean head kick with one arm. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7420.0s)]
*  No. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7424.0s)]
*  No. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7425.0s)]
*  Even two arms are still getting rattled. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7426.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7427.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7428.0s)]
*  Especially your kick. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7429.0s)]
*  That was like, you were setting it up beautiful. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7430.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7432.0s)]
*  Just technique. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7433.0s)]
*  Just turn it over right when it needs to be turned. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7434.0s)]
*  And you landed it multiple times, too. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7436.0s)]
*  It's like you didn't make an adjustment. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7438.0s)]
*  You kept landing that shot. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7439.0s)]
*  He made an adjustment. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7440.0s)]
*  He did. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7441.0s)]
*  He made an adjustment. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7442.0s)]
*  The thing was, it's just, I went and he made it. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7443.0s)]
*  He adjusts, I adjust it. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7446.0s)]
*  And then I eventually work my way back to it. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7447.0s)]
*  And he wasn't ready for it. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7450.0s)]
*  You can be like, all right, yeah, I'm not going to let him. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7452.0s)]
*  He caught me with a head kick. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7454.0s)]
*  I'm not going to let him hit me with a head kick. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7455.0s)]
*  All right, now he's punching you. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7457.0s)]
*  Now he's throwing straights down the middle and he's hitting you in the face. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7458.0s)]
*  Now he's throwing straights and he's hitting you to the body. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7460.0s)]
*  Now he's chopping your legs. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7463.0s)]
*  Now he's kicking you in the body. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7465.0s)]
*  Now he's fainting. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7467.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7468.0s)]
*  He's fainting and he's catching you with combinations. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7469.0s)]
*  Now all of a sudden, now you land the shot. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7471.0s)]
*  All right, now I got to try to press forward. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7475.0s)]
*  All right, step, step, side, head kick, bang. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7477.0s)]
*  Now you get hit with the same head kick again. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7480.0s)]
*  And it's like, damn, I thought I had adjusted. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7482.0s)]
*  Like, am I going to be able to, like, the doubt starts to seep in. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7485.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7489.0s)]
*  You know? [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7490.0s)]
*  And I understand that. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7491.0s)]
*  I understand how. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7492.0s)]
*  I understand. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7493.0s)]
*  I've gone through a lot of things in training, a lot of things over, like, [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7494.0s)]
*  I've had total amateur, I think, amateur, I had like 13 fights. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7496.0s)]
*  So I've had dealt with a lot of different things. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7500.0s)]
*  So I kind of, I got the idea of how to process things and how people think [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7503.0s)]
*  whenever they, whenever they go through it, like getting hit hard, [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7507.0s)]
*  which is still why I don't understand how Glover didn't pause at all. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7511.0s)]
*  Because I've been hit hard. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7515.0s)]
*  Like, I've been, like, hit hard. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7517.0s)]
*  It's like. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7519.0s)]
*  Who hit you the hardest in the UFC? [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7520.0s)]
*  In the UFC? [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7522.0s)]
*  UFC? [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7523.0s)]
*  Darko Stoesig. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7527.0s)]
*  Yeah? [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7528.0s)]
*  Probably. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7529.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7530.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7531.0s)]
*  What's your name? [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7532.0s)]
*  Tiago. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7533.0s)]
*  His fist. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7534.0s)]
*  You know, he hit me with a, hit me with like an overhand, like an overhand, [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7535.0s)]
*  like, like, like a looping hook, like a bow, like one of those. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7544.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7550.0s)]
*  Yeah, probably. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7551.0s)]
*  Well, he hit me the most, probably. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7554.0s)]
*  But Santos. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7559.0s)]
*  Santos hits hard. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7561.0s)]
*  Santos hits hard. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7562.0s)]
*  He hits hard, but the only punch that really, like, it didn't hurt, [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7563.0s)]
*  but it did damage, like the one that swore in my eye. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7569.0s)]
*  You know, but he hits hard. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7572.0s)]
*  If he, I'm pretty sure he hits hard. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7576.0s)]
*  If he hits hard, if he lands flush on you, the only thing is he don't put [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7578.0s)]
*  himself in position to, like, stick you. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7580.0s)]
*  So, like, whenever he's hitting, if you notice, like, whenever I was going [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7583.0s)]
*  through him, he was landing those, I'm still, I'm, you can roll them all. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7586.0s)]
*  You can roll his shots off. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7589.0s)]
*  And I think that's why Glover survived against him, because he was fucking [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7592.0s)]
*  Glover up. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7595.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7596.0s)]
*  No, he was a dangerous dude. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7597.0s)]
*  To this day, he gave John Jones some serious fucking trouble, and John, [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7599.0s)]
*  John destroyed his legs. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7603.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7605.0s)]
*  He needed double knee surgery after the fight. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7606.0s)]
*  Double. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7608.0s)]
*  Both of his knees were destroyed. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7609.0s)]
*  I seen him in the wheelchair. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7610.0s)]
*  Yeah, crazy. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7611.0s)]
*  John just destroyed his knees, a sidekick to the knees. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7613.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, John is so good at that. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7616.0s)]
*  One of his knees, they messed up, he tried to kick John, and John slid back [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7618.0s)]
*  and made a mess, and he hyperextended his leg. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7623.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7626.0s)]
*  Yeah, he fucked up both knees in one fight, and really was never the same [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7628.0s)]
*  again. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7631.0s)]
*  I think he wins. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7632.0s)]
*  I think he wins in PFL. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7633.0s)]
*  You think so? [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7635.0s)]
*  I think he wins. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7636.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7637.0s)]
*  Is that where he's going now? [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7638.0s)]
*  That's where he went. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7639.0s)]
*  He did go there. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7640.0s)]
*  He went to the PFL. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7641.0s)]
*  PFL's interesting. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7642.0s)]
*  You know, it's interesting to have more options. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7643.0s)]
*  I just, I wonder how much longer they can keep putting out that cash. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7644.0s)]
*  You know, I don't know how much money they're making. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7647.0s)]
*  I haven't seen them in a packed arena. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7649.0s)]
*  I don't think they have a packed arena. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7652.0s)]
*  I don't think they can sell a packed arena. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7654.0s)]
*  Maybe they can sell if they get some bigger name fighters, but, you know, [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7656.0s)]
*  Bellator pulls off big places now, and they get big numbers on television. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7659.0s)]
*  They got a million for Fador, Ryan Bader, too. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7663.0s)]
*  That's a lot. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7665.0s)]
*  You know, a million people watching you. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7666.0s)]
*  That's a lot. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7668.0s)]
*  And so it's good. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7669.0s)]
*  It's good for everybody. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7670.0s)]
*  The more there's real competition, the more... [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7671.0s)]
*  How do you watch Bellator fights? [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7673.0s)]
*  You can watch it on CBS. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7675.0s)]
*  You can watch it on Showtime. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7677.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7679.0s)]
*  Yeah, I have it on my DirecTV. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7680.0s)]
*  DirecTV looks for it whenever it comes up and it records it for me. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7681.0s)]
*  But yeah, I'm not as big a Bellator fan as maybe I should be, but I'm aware of [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7685.0s)]
*  There's guys over there that are real talented. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7690.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7692.0s)]
*  Johnny Elbin, that middleweight dude. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7693.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's my dog. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7695.0s)]
*  Shout out to Johnny. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7696.0s)]
*  He's legit. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7697.0s)]
*  I met Johnny. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7698.0s)]
*  He's fucking legit. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7699.0s)]
*  We went down to Florida for my boy Sabah's birthday. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7700.0s)]
*  I met Johnny down there. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7704.0s)]
*  He's a cool dude. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7706.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's a cool dude and he's focused. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7707.0s)]
*  He's focused and driven. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7710.0s)]
*  He's one of those guys I got my eye on. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7712.0s)]
*  You know, I'm like, that guy, he could be a champion in any organization. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7714.0s)]
*  He's got that kind of quality to him and a real good wrestler. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7718.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7722.0s)]
*  Real good wrestler and fucking striking is nasty too, man. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7723.0s)]
*  When he beat Gagard Musasi, I think that opened up a lot of people's eyes [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7726.0s)]
*  because Gagard is a fucking assassin. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7729.0s)]
*  Gagard is a smooth criminal. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7731.0s)]
*  That dude is good. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7734.0s)]
*  And when he beat Gagard, I was like, wow. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7736.0s)]
*  And he beat Gagard on the feet too. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7738.0s)]
*  Like that was a big fight for Johnny. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7740.0s)]
*  And I look at him like that because Gagard, after Gagard had beat Chris, [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7743.0s)]
*  after Gagard had beat Chris Weidman and Gagard left and went over to Bellator, [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7747.0s)]
*  I was like, wow, I guess we're not going to see him in the UFC anymore. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7752.0s)]
*  That sucks because I think Gagard, I would have loved to see Gagard versus Anderson [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7756.0s)]
*  or rather Gagard versus Israel. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7761.0s)]
*  I would have loved to see him versus Robert Whitaker. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7764.0s)]
*  I would have loved to see him. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7766.0s)]
*  It's a lot of fun matchups to get a real opinion too. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7768.0s)]
*  And he was right at that level where I'm thinking he might be the best in the world. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7771.0s)]
*  He was like right there. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7775.0s)]
*  And then he went over and won the Bellator title and eventually lost to Elbin. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7776.0s)]
*  You know, it's good to have these other organizations though. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7781.0s)]
*  I think it's great for the fighters. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7785.0s)]
*  It's great for the fighters to have financial options. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7789.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7792.0s)]
*  I mean, like I said, I don't know where Francis is going. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7793.0s)]
*  What I'm genuinely hopeful, I really hope Francis goes, [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7796.0s)]
*  get some big money boxing match, get successful. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7800.0s)]
*  Then we figure out who wins versus John Jones and Cyril Gahn. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7803.0s)]
*  And then they offer him what he's worth and then have him come back. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7806.0s)]
*  And maybe they do like another world title fight with Francis coming back. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7810.0s)]
*  I think the market and the landscape can change a little bit with the whole Jake Paul signing with the PFL. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7817.0s)]
*  Very interesting. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7825.0s)]
*  Because it brings eyes, it brings attention, which brings money. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7826.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's he might be the only guy that can really waken up people to the PFL because he's so popular in mainstream. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7829.0s)]
*  When Francis comes too. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7838.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7840.0s)]
*  But who's he going to fight? Who do they have over there to fight? [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7843.0s)]
*  I'm like Francis versus John Jones is the biggest fight you can make. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7846.0s)]
*  That's especially if John Jones can beat Cyril Gahn. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7851.0s)]
*  If John Jones beats Cyril Gahn, that is the biggest heavyweight fight that's ever existed. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7855.0s)]
*  Who's on the way out the door in the UFC? [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7859.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing. Who is on the way out the door? [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7861.0s)]
*  Who's on their way out? [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7864.0s)]
*  But this guy's on the way up like Sergey Pavlovich. That dude's a bad motherfucker. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7866.0s)]
*  I was shocked by what he did to Ty. I was shocked, bro. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7870.0s)]
*  Crazy, right? [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7874.0s)]
*  I was like, man, what? [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7875.0s)]
*  I know. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7877.0s)]
*  Patient, calculating. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7878.0s)]
*  And so accurate. So good. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7879.0s)]
*  Yeah, bro. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7881.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's legit as fuck. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7882.0s)]
*  And kind of flying under the radar with mainstream people. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7884.0s)]
*  I can't bet against him anymore because I bet against him the last couple fights. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7887.0s)]
*  Not bet. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7891.0s)]
*  He's not betting. Gambling is illegal for Francis. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7892.0s)]
*  It's illegal. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7894.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7895.0s)]
*  We don't bring... We believe in following rules here. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7896.0s)]
*  We follow all the rules here. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7899.0s)]
*  Well, you could bet back then, right? [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7901.0s)]
*  The gambling thing is a recently illegal thing. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7903.0s)]
*  Fuck that. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7906.0s)]
*  They need to change that shit. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7907.0s)]
*  Anytime I'm like picked against him, I was wrong. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7909.0s)]
*  I was wrong. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7913.0s)]
*  It's hard to tell until he starts beating really good people. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7915.0s)]
*  He doesn't look like he moves. He's actually pretty quick for a heavyweight. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7917.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think this was a fight. I think I had Alistair in this fight. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7925.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, this was the Alistair fight. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7929.0s)]
*  He ended up piecing him up. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7931.0s)]
*  It was a good fight. And this was a fight where no one knew who Pavlovich was. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7932.0s)]
*  And Alistair took him down. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7937.0s)]
*  Wrestling Alistair. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7939.0s)]
*  Yeah. Alistair hammer-fisted him. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7940.0s)]
*  Look at this. Alistair had him in fucking serious trouble here. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7942.0s)]
*  Look at this. That's it. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7945.0s)]
*  So Alistair stopped him. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7947.0s)]
*  And then that was a lot of people's understanding of who he is. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7949.0s)]
*  And then he goes from that and then starts going on a fucking tear. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7953.0s)]
*  Wrestling Alistair. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7957.0s)]
*  When Alistair started wrestling people, that was a bad dude, bro. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7959.0s)]
*  Well, Alistair was a dangerous motherfucker, man. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7962.0s)]
*  Yeah. But whenever he started wrestling, like grappling, [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7965.0s)]
*  like actually taking dudes down, putting them on their backs and laying off that, that was... [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7969.0s)]
*  Yeah, look, the guy has one of the most incredible careers in combat sports. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7974.0s)]
*  He fought in Pride. He fought in Dream. He was the Dream Heavyweight Champion. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7978.0s)]
*  He won the K-1 Grand Prix. He won the Strikeforce title. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7982.0s)]
*  Comes over to the UFC and becomes one of the best heavyweights in the world at the UFC, too. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7986.0s)]
*  And now he's back at glory kickboxing. He just beat Badr Hari in a kickboxing fight. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7992.0s)]
*  I mean, Alistair's been doing the damn thing for 20 plus years at a world class level. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=7997.0s)]
*  It's pretty impressive. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8003.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's like heavyweight glover. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8005.0s)]
*  Yeah. In a lot of ways, yeah. But he's just not as old. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8007.0s)]
*  He just got his start very young. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8012.0s)]
*  Remember when Alistair would first start fighting? He was so skinny. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8014.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8017.0s)]
*  He was so skinny. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8018.0s)]
*  This is Twig. But he was ripped though. He's always been ripped as shit though. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8019.0s)]
*  Yeah. But he was fighting at 205. Chuck Liddell, he knocked him out at 205. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8024.0s)]
*  And he was beating Chuck up. And Chuck caught him against the ropes. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8029.0s)]
*  But again, at heavyweight, for me, Ingano versus the winner of Jones and Cyril Gahn, [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8033.0s)]
*  that's the biggest fight you can make. And that's what I really hope. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8039.0s)]
*  I hope Francis goes and gets some big money, boxing match, and God forbid if he wins, [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8042.0s)]
*  we'll probably never see him again. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8047.0s)]
*  Nah, probably not. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8049.0s)]
*  If he wins, he'll just probably be raking in the cash. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8050.0s)]
*  Next thing you see, Francis is covered in diamonds, jewelry. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8052.0s)]
*  Half-weight naked on the back of Sports Illustrated. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8056.0s)]
*  Yeah. Look, he could do it. The guy's main skill is striking. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8060.0s)]
*  So if he wants to box, I mean, you're dealing with a guy who's 265 pounds natural. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8066.0s)]
*  And he has to cut a little bit of weight to make the 265-pound weight limit in the UFC. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8072.0s)]
*  There's no weight limit in boxing, so he doesn't have to cut anything. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8077.0s)]
*  Francis had to cut to make weight? [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8080.0s)]
*  Sometimes Francis was over 265. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8082.0s)]
*  I wouldn't say cut. I would say watch his food and watch. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8085.0s)]
*  But I talked to Eric Nixik in one point in time. He was over 290. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8090.0s)]
*  Jesus. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8094.0s)]
*  That's a big fella. That's a lot of horsepower behind those punches. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8097.0s)]
*  Yeah, with a big dunk. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8100.0s)]
*  Boom, boom, bang. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8102.0s)]
*  Man, bro. Him boxing Tyson Fury, bro, I don't think that's a bad idea. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8103.0s)]
*  I think personally it's a bad idea. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8109.0s)]
*  It's a good idea if you want a lot of zeros in your bank account. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8111.0s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8114.0s)]
*  But to be humiliated. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8116.0s)]
*  Yes. I hurt your brand. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8118.0s)]
*  He said he could have weighed 307 here. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8120.0s)]
*  Oh my God. Was that after his knee surgery? [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8123.0s)]
*  It might have been after his knee surgery, yeah. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8127.0s)]
*  I'd rather fight that, for instance, than in shape ready at one point, for instance. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8130.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8135.0s)]
*  But no, Tyson is a big dude. He's big. He's given up the size. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8137.0s)]
*  Six, nine. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8142.0s)]
*  And not only that, he knows how to box. He knows the science behind the punches. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8143.0s)]
*  He knows the science behind the counters. He knows the science behind the setups. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8147.0s)]
*  That's not something. Then you're coming into his world. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8151.0s)]
*  That's not something to play with, bro. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8155.0s)]
*  And he's going to keep you on the end of that stick for as long as he can. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8158.0s)]
*  And he's going to box you up. He's going to clinch you whenever he can. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8162.0s)]
*  I was about to say, as soon as you try to wind up big, you try to land big, he's just going to tie you up. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8165.0s)]
*  And there is no, oh, we'll fight. We'll fight to get loot. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8170.0s)]
*  And there is none of that. It's just a restart. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8173.0s)]
*  And then with Francis, the other thing is if he fights someone who's a lesser named opponent and loses that fight, that's terrible. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8175.0s)]
*  So it's almost like he's got to jump right into the deep end of the pool. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8184.0s)]
*  But I think right now Tyson Fury is concentrating on the Usyk fight. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8188.0s)]
*  And that seems like it's going to happen. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8193.0s)]
*  So if Tyson Fury fights Usyk, that kind of like leaves Francis in limbo. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8195.0s)]
*  And that's why I think they're talking about Deontay Wilder. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8201.0s)]
*  See if that is real. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8204.0s)]
*  Only Wilder said it in an interview. He said he wants to do a one on one. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8206.0s)]
*  And I don't think Wingon has responded to that yet. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8211.0s)]
*  OK, so he's just putting it out there. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8214.0s)]
*  I know there was some talk. I think there was some talk of Dillion White, too. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8216.0s)]
*  There's some talk of like some other top flight heavyweights. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8221.0s)]
*  But that's the problem is like those guys are fucking good, man. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8223.0s)]
*  Like if Francis get exposed in one of those fights and can't box with those guys, then all that big money goes away. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8227.0s)]
*  Because the big money is Francis is the destroyer. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8234.0s)]
*  He shows his highlight reel to Alistair. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8237.0s)]
*  That's why he didn't want to do the boxing thing. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8239.0s)]
*  Yeah, look, I get it from their perspective. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8243.0s)]
*  I don't know if that was the major sticking point. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8246.0s)]
*  I don't I'm not privy to the negotiations. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8248.0s)]
*  But in my mind, like that's the best heavyweight in the world. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8250.0s)]
*  And you've got to you know, when the guy beats Cyril Gahn handily with one knee and then you see Cyril Gahn fighting in his next fight for the title. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8253.0s)]
*  I want to see the Cyril Gahn fight. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8260.0s)]
*  Look, Cyril Gahn versus Ty Dooevassa was amazing. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8262.0s)]
*  Cyril Gahn is a heavyweight. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8265.0s)]
*  He moves different than any other heavyweight. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8267.0s)]
*  Light on his feet. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8269.0s)]
*  He throws that weird front kick off that front leg. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8271.0s)]
*  It's like a stepping man. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8273.0s)]
*  Yes, man. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8275.0s)]
*  It's nasty to leave that from his lead leg. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8276.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8278.0s)]
*  So it's like he's standing sideways stabbing you with any twists with it when he throws it like he's standing totally sideways. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8279.0s)]
*  He's standing this way and he's bouncing around and he like twists and stabs you with that front leg. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8286.0s)]
*  You and your kidney. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8294.0s)]
*  Yeah, he stabs dudes and his movement and his agility at heavyweight is different than everybody else's. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8297.0s)]
*  He moves like a middleweight or a lightweight. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8303.0s)]
*  I mean, like a light heavyweight. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8306.0s)]
*  He's much lighter on his feet than someone who's, you know, in the heavyweight division mostly. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8308.0s)]
*  It's different. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8314.0s)]
*  He's a problem. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8315.0s)]
*  He's a problem. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8316.0s)]
*  He's a big dude. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8317.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's a big dude. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8318.0s)]
*  So the fact that John won't be able to just bully him. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8319.0s)]
*  He won't be able to big boy him. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8325.0s)]
*  I'm interested to see that. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8326.0s)]
*  And John has no problem chopping at John's legs. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8329.0s)]
*  I think for a good portion, maybe even in the early part, we might see a kick leg kick and match. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8333.0s)]
*  Could be. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8340.0s)]
*  I don't know if John wants a kick to kick with that guy though. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8341.0s)]
*  No, but that might be all he can get to. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8344.0s)]
*  Well, Francis took him down repeatedly. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8346.0s)]
*  That's where I go. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8349.0s)]
*  Because if John Jones can wrestle you like John's wrestles on another level. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8352.0s)]
*  See, and that's it. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8356.0s)]
*  There's a difference. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8357.0s)]
*  And there's this the difference where people made between Santos and the Glover with me. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8358.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8362.0s)]
*  Is John Jones as strong as Francis and Gatto? [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8363.0s)]
*  No, no. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8366.0s)]
*  That's you got to factor that in. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8368.0s)]
*  You got to factor that in. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8369.0s)]
*  Glover wasn't as strong as the Tiago Santos. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8371.0s)]
*  Now, technically, skill for skill, I'd give the grappling to Glover. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8375.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8380.0s)]
*  But Santos was strong as shit. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8381.0s)]
*  So it took a different type of like, like resistance and like defense to, you know, I mean, to fight to fight him to fight him off from his take downs. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8384.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8394.0s)]
*  I had to actually strain and be strong with him. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8395.0s)]
*  You know, switch to what took which took some energy, took some things on me that I wasn't expecting because I was expecting us to be strong. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8398.0s)]
*  I was expecting us to come out and bang. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8404.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8406.0s)]
*  You know, Glover was making technical moves. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8407.0s)]
*  So it's all right. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8412.0s)]
*  This step to the next step to the next step type deal. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8413.0s)]
*  You know, that's not really that's not going to strain you too, too much. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8416.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8419.0s)]
*  You know, it can, especially if you get behind, you know, but those that's different, though. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8420.0s)]
*  Those are two different styles of grappling. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8426.0s)]
*  So you so that really don't work like, oh, he was able to do this. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8428.0s)]
*  So he's going to be able to. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8432.0s)]
*  I don't Jones is is in his strongest Francis. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8433.0s)]
*  No. So a lot of those positions that he was getting where he's getting serial gone down, he was just he just bullied him, like just tossed him. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8438.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know what I'm saying? [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8445.0s)]
*  I don't think John Jones can do that. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8446.0s)]
*  Also, you got to think that serial gone going into that fight with Francis probably didn't expect grappling. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8447.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8452.0s)]
*  Serial gone probably thought this is going to be a stand up fight. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8453.0s)]
*  I believe it. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8456.0s)]
*  I did. I expected Francis to grab a little more. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8457.0s)]
*  Did you? [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8459.0s)]
*  I did. Just because so I moved too much. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8460.0s)]
*  He moves too much. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8463.0s)]
*  How is she going to get a hold of him and try to, you know, I mean, slow the fight down to your pace? [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8464.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8468.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8470.0s)]
*  That's that's true. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8471.0s)]
*  That's one way of looking at it. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8472.0s)]
*  But, you know, Francis said that during the sparring exchanges that they had when they were training together in the gym, he hurt zero. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8473.0s)]
*  Training isn't the same thing because you know, you're not trying to be a dick to your partner. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8481.0s)]
*  You're not trying to hurt your partner. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8484.0s)]
*  You're just trying to get looks and things like that. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8485.0s)]
*  So like training is not the same thing. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8487.0s)]
*  Well, luckily now, you know, it's interesting where we're at now because fighters are so much more scientific in the way they train. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8490.0s)]
*  But if you go back to the early days of MMA, [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8497.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's how they did it. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8499.0s)]
*  dudes just fought. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8500.0s)]
*  They fought in the gym. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8501.0s)]
*  They knocked each other out all the time. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8502.0s)]
*  That's why Sean Strickland. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8504.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, Sean Strickland, that guy fucking spars hard. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8505.0s)]
*  He keeps asking me if I want to get some work in. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8509.0s)]
*  I think we want to get some. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8513.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8515.0s)]
*  He's an interesting cat. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8516.0s)]
*  It's peculiar. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8518.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's definitely peculiar. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8520.0s)]
*  His style is so different, too. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8522.0s)]
*  That's a very odd style. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8524.0s)]
*  I like the way he fights. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8525.0s)]
*  Like, watch the fight. He's funny as hell. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8526.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's funny. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8527.0s)]
*  I hate his boots. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8528.0s)]
*  His boots? [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8529.0s)]
*  His fucking boots are terrible. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8530.0s)]
*  What kind of boots is he wearing? [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8531.0s)]
*  I don't know. They look terrible. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8532.0s)]
*  I've never seen his boots. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8533.0s)]
*  Throw your boots away, Sean. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8537.0s)]
*  What's wrong with his boots? [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8538.0s)]
*  What are they like? [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8539.0s)]
*  I don't know, bro. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8540.0s)]
*  They just look like... [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8541.0s)]
*  Those things? [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8542.0s)]
*  Yeah, bro. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8543.0s)]
*  They got to go, bro. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8544.0s)]
*  Why is he wearing those boots in his fighter picture? [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8546.0s)]
*  That's so weird. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8549.0s)]
*  And it's Vegas, bro. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8550.0s)]
*  It's Vegas, bro. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8551.0s)]
*  It's hot as shit. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8552.0s)]
*  Why do you have boots? [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8553.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8554.0s)]
*  For no reason should you live in Vegas [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8555.0s)]
*  and own a pair of boots. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8557.0s)]
*  Yeah, are you working on a construction site? [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8558.0s)]
*  Why do you have boots on like that? [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8561.0s)]
*  Are you hiking? [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8563.0s)]
*  He's misappropriating construction workers. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8564.0s)]
*  Yeah, his big victory over Imamov. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8569.0s)]
*  That was a big fight. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8572.0s)]
*  Big fight. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8573.0s)]
*  And gutted it out. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8574.0s)]
*  Short term, didn't have a lot of time [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8576.0s)]
*  to prepare for that fight. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8578.0s)]
*  That was the one after New Year's, right? [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8580.0s)]
*  It was the one before. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8582.0s)]
*  It was before. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8583.0s)]
*  The last fight of the year. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8584.0s)]
*  I mean, no, he fought the fight. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8585.0s)]
*  He even headlined the last and the last fight. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8588.0s)]
*  That was the beginning. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8591.0s)]
*  That was January. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8592.0s)]
*  That's right, you're right. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8593.0s)]
*  That was the beginning. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8594.0s)]
*  But he had just fought like two weeks before that. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8595.0s)]
*  And you let me fight a little heavier. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8598.0s)]
*  I would agree most people could probably do that. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8601.0s)]
*  That's true too, right? [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8604.0s)]
*  Because you're the most professional fighter, [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8605.0s)]
*  most top level fighters. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8607.0s)]
*  Two weeks after you fought, you're not that bad. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8609.0s)]
*  Even if you've been eating like shit, [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8612.0s)]
*  you're still something. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8614.0s)]
*  You're still a fighter. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8615.0s)]
*  You're still a fighter. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8616.0s)]
*  You're still a fighter. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8617.0s)]
*  You're still a fighter. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8618.0s)]
*  You're still a fighter. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8619.0s)]
*  You're still sitting pretty good. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8620.0s)]
*  Who's the imam of God supposed to fight? [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8621.0s)]
*  Kelvin Gaslam? [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8623.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8624.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8625.0s)]
*  That's a way different fight too, right? [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8626.0s)]
*  Because Calvin's shorter. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8627.0s)]
*  I mean, he leans a little more. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8629.0s)]
*  He's a little bit more boxy. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8631.0s)]
*  He comes to you a little more, [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8632.0s)]
*  whereas Sean fights really long and kind of awkward [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8633.0s)]
*  and gives you different angles and ... [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8637.0s)]
*  Calvin's one of those dudes. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8639.0s)]
*  I had a conversation with Calvin once. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8640.0s)]
*  I was like, Calvin, you could be a world champion at 170. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8642.0s)]
*  You just got to get your shit together. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8645.0s)]
*  You just got to lose that weight. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8646.0s)]
*  Because he's such a tank. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8648.0s)]
*  At 170, he would be lean and ripped [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8650.0s)]
*  and has all these advantages. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8654.0s)]
*  Same size. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8656.0s)]
*  Those dudes are ... [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8657.0s)]
*  That's the only thing about 185. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8658.0s)]
*  Those dudes are too tall. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8660.0s)]
*  They're just too big. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8661.0s)]
*  They're too big for him to ... [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8662.0s)]
*  When you see Pahetta, he's so big. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8664.0s)]
*  Kelvin's my size. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8668.0s)]
*  It doesn't make sense that he's fighting at 185 pounds. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8670.0s)]
*  When you see who, I don't see nobody, Joe. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8672.0s)]
*  Oh, you don't see him? [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8675.0s)]
*  I don't see him, Joe. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8676.0s)]
*  When you guys are staring at each other after the fight, [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8677.0s)]
*  that was a weird moment. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8679.0s)]
*  We weren't even staring at each other, literally. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8680.0s)]
*  I walked up ... [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8682.0s)]
*  Calvin went over to shake my team's hand. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8683.0s)]
*  I walked up to shake his hand. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8685.0s)]
*  The whole thing that him getting mad about the uh, [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8687.0s)]
*  like the uh, the whole, what are you going to say about knocking? [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8690.0s)]
*  What about knocking me out? [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8693.0s)]
*  Dude, I said that shit months ago. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8694.0s)]
*  Yeah, I said it. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8696.0s)]
*  I said the shit. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8697.0s)]
*  I believe the shit. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8698.0s)]
*  You come up to 205. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8699.0s)]
*  You sign a contract to fight me. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8701.0s)]
*  I plan on knocking you the fuck out. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8703.0s)]
*  Period. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8706.0s)]
*  You know? [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8707.0s)]
*  I don't get what the ... [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8708.0s)]
*  He's like all like, [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8709.0s)]
*  well, maybe Hill should be the backup for me and Izzy fighting all that. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8710.0s)]
*  Like, bro, if you want to fight me, like for real, for real, [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8713.0s)]
*  just come up. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8716.0s)]
*  Go ahead. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8718.0s)]
*  Go ahead, vacate your belt. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8719.0s)]
*  Do whatever you're going to do, whatever you want to do. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8720.0s)]
*  And make it happen, bro. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8723.0s)]
*  Make it happen. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8724.0s)]
*  I'm not ... [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8725.0s)]
*  I'm not ducking nobody, bro. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8726.0s)]
*  I'm here for all the smoke. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8728.0s)]
*  I want to fight everybody. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8730.0s)]
*  I want those fights. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8731.0s)]
*  You know? [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8732.0s)]
*  I don't think he gets past Izzy this time. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8733.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8735.0s)]
*  I think Izzy wins this one. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8736.0s)]
*  Really? [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8737.0s)]
*  You know? [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8738.0s)]
*  Just, bro, he was winning. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8739.0s)]
*  He was winning. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8740.0s)]
*  He was winning in pretty good fashion. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8741.0s)]
*  He was winning and he had him hurt real bad at the end of that first round. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8742.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8745.0s)]
*  Real bad. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8746.0s)]
*  If that fight, if you got 30 seconds more in that fight, [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8747.0s)]
*  he might not make it out of that first round. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8750.0s)]
*  10. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8752.0s)]
*  10. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8753.0s)]
*  If he throws that hook that he was going to throw, [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8754.0s)]
*  and that lands, the fight's over. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8756.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8758.0s)]
*  Interesting rematch. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8759.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8761.0s)]
*  That's April, right? [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8762.0s)]
*  That's Miami. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8763.0s)]
*  That's going to be wild. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8764.0s)]
*  If I got any, like, my only thing I would do differently, [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8765.0s)]
*  then I'm definitely 100% not telling them how to fight or anything like that. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8771.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8775.0s)]
*  Don't focus so much on the kicks. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8777.0s)]
*  Just box his ass. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8779.0s)]
*  Alex can't box. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8780.0s)]
*  He can't box. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8782.0s)]
*  Box his ass. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8785.0s)]
*  And you knock him out easy. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8786.0s)]
*  You think so? [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8787.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8788.0s)]
*  Really? [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8789.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8790.0s)]
*  The problem is Alex is kicking. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8792.0s)]
*  You know, he's always jumping on those fucking legs. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8794.0s)]
*  People are kicking me. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8796.0s)]
*  People don't thought I could only box for all this time. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8798.0s)]
*  So I'm going to be honest. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8800.0s)]
*  If you stay on the right angle, and you press that box of reigns enough, [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8802.0s)]
*  kicking don't help you. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8807.0s)]
*  That's going on one leg. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8808.0s)]
*  If I'm in reigns to put these hands on you, [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8810.0s)]
*  and you go up on one leg, you just did me a favor. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8812.0s)]
*  Mmm. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8815.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8817.0s)]
*  I'm saying a little too much, but I can say this, [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8818.0s)]
*  I'm still going to whoop his ass if it ever happens. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8820.0s)]
*  So if they fight again, and Alex, even if Alex loses, [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8824.0s)]
*  if he loses, maybe that's a good reason for him to go up to light heavyweight. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8829.0s)]
*  But also, if it's a close fight, he's going to want a rubber match. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8832.0s)]
*  He's going to want a rubber match. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8836.0s)]
*  I mean, he beat Izzy for the title in the fifth round, [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8838.0s)]
*  stopped him in the fifth round. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8841.0s)]
*  But do you do that, though? [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8842.0s)]
*  If he didn't defend the belt? [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8843.0s)]
*  Like, what's up with all this, like, [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8845.0s)]
*  that'd be like if I fought my next fight, [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8847.0s)]
*  and then it was a close fight and I lost, [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8850.0s)]
*  do I get a rematch just because the fight was close? [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8852.0s)]
*  Like, whatever happened to it, to like, you know what I mean, [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8856.0s)]
*  earning the rematch, like, establishing the reign, [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8859.0s)]
*  showing, like, I think rematch, [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8862.0s)]
*  most champs that get instant rematches was because it's like, [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8864.0s)]
*  all right, this dude's the best, or maybe he just had an off night. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8867.0s)]
*  Well, I think it's because we want to see it again, [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8870.0s)]
*  because it was so close. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8873.0s)]
*  We want to see, like, me as a person who loves watching, [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8874.0s)]
*  like, really skillful guys go at it, [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8877.0s)]
*  I want to see who makes the adjustments, who doesn't. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8879.0s)]
*  Like, Max Holloway and Volkanovski. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8882.0s)]
*  It's a perfect example. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8884.0s)]
*  The first fight, we were real close. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8885.0s)]
*  Volkanovski comes on and wins the second fight. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8887.0s)]
*  Also pretty close. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8889.0s)]
*  The third fight, no. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8890.0s)]
*  But he fought zombie in between. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8891.0s)]
*  Yes, true, true. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8894.0s)]
*  You know, so it's like, so somebody else got their shot. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8895.0s)]
*  You know, he got a little taste of a different flavor, [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8899.0s)]
*  if you will, you know, and I don't know if, well, shit. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8902.0s)]
*  Well, the fact that Izzy has completely wiped out the entire weight class [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8908.0s)]
*  might, oh, man, shit, it might happen. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8913.0s)]
*  It might happen. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8916.0s)]
*  I don't think of it like that. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8917.0s)]
*  It does make sense. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8918.0s)]
*  It makes sense. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8919.0s)]
*  Well, Robert Whitaker, Robert Whitaker in that last fight with Izzy, [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8920.0s)]
*  that was very close. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8922.0s)]
*  Close, close. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8923.0s)]
*  Very close. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8924.0s)]
*  And that's a great example of a guy who got destroyed in the first fight [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8925.0s)]
*  and made all the adjustments, made great adjustments. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8928.0s)]
*  Be canineer, who's fucking dangerous as shit. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8930.0s)]
*  Dangerous as shit. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8932.0s)]
*  And then went on and gave Izzy a really fucking tough fight. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8933.0s)]
*  That was a really tough fight. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8937.0s)]
*  I liked that fight a lot. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8938.0s)]
*  I think Whitaker is a dangerous fight for Paheta, too. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8939.0s)]
*  I think he is, too. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8943.0s)]
*  I think Whitaker is actually a more dangerous fight than Izzy is [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8944.0s)]
*  because one, because Rob actually does box a little more. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8949.0s)]
*  And two, the angles, the angles of the movement and the mix in the way [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8952.0s)]
*  he mixes in the grapple. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8959.0s)]
*  He almost fights like a karate style. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8960.0s)]
*  Light on his feet. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8961.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's almost like a bobbing in and out. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8962.0s)]
*  And the minute it faints and the minute you buy something, he sell you. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8965.0s)]
*  He sell you. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8970.0s)]
*  He give you what you pay for. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8971.0s)]
*  He give you what you pay for. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8972.0s)]
*  And he blitzes you. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8973.0s)]
*  And I think he's in a different level. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8974.0s)]
*  But he blitzes you at an angle. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8976.0s)]
*  He blitzes you off at an angle. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8977.0s)]
*  So it's pretty. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8978.0s)]
*  This is not taking anything away from Izzy, but I feel like Robert was in a funk then. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8979.0s)]
*  I feel like it wasn't fighting to the best of his abilities. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8983.0s)]
*  And he just fought right into Izzy's hands in that fight. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8986.0s)]
*  And also that's Izzy putting an arm. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8989.0s)]
*  I think Izzy's presence kind of stuns and shocks people. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8991.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8996.0s)]
*  Izzy may look like on TV, he may look skinny, but in person Izzy's a pretty big dude. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=8997.0s)]
*  He's tall and he hits hard and he's accurate as fuck. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9002.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9006.0s)]
*  He's solid. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9007.0s)]
*  Like we like skinny. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9008.0s)]
*  Skinny don't mean shit if it's just straight, dense muscle. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9009.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9011.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9012.0s)]
*  So he's got some size to him. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9013.0s)]
*  So he does have like some, oh, okay. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9016.0s)]
*  Because Rob is like what, 6'1"? [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9019.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9022.0s)]
*  Izzy's my size. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9023.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9025.0s)]
*  He's a big tall dude. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9026.0s)]
*  I thought it was interesting when he fought Jan Behovic. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9028.0s)]
*  He decided to not even gain any weight. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9031.0s)]
*  Just decided to fight like 194. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9033.0s)]
*  I think that was a mistake. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9035.0s)]
*  I think that was a mistake. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9037.0s)]
*  But honestly Jan started catching his timing with some of the like the, with the stand up too. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9039.0s)]
*  Like he started cutting that little, I think it was like a jab, like a little quick little pop, like a little pop in jab. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9045.0s)]
*  He started laying in that to disrupt his timing and disrupt whenever Izzy was coming forward. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9050.0s)]
*  So he had some success with that. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9055.0s)]
*  But yeah man. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9058.0s)]
*  Izzy definitely should have gained some weight for that fight. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9063.0s)]
*  Because then at the end whenever you started to get tired and now the main thing that you had was speed. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9067.0s)]
*  Because I believe Izzy was landing a hook. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9073.0s)]
*  Lead hook, lead left hook, lead left hook or switch right hook. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9075.0s)]
*  One of those, one of those sides he was landing that on Behovic. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9079.0s)]
*  And he was landing it, he was landing it pretty solid. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9082.0s)]
*  Then it just went to the wrestling. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9085.0s)]
*  And when Behovic took him down you see the size. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9087.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9089.0s)]
*  He was so much bigger. [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9090.0s)]
*  But you see the size difference with Pahana too. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9091.0s)]
*  Pahana's way bigger. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9094.0s)]
*  He's skinny though. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9095.0s)]
*  He's thinner. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9096.0s)]
*  He's pretty muscular. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9097.0s)]
*  He's muscular but he's like, he's taller but he's like, he's thinner. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9099.0s)]
*  Like for 205, for 185 yeah he's like that. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9104.0s)]
*  But you put him at 205 he's not like that. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9107.0s)]
*  I think he's definitely the same height as Johnny Walker. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9110.0s)]
*  Is he built like Johnny Walker? [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9112.0s)]
*  No. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9114.0s)]
*  No. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9115.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9116.0s)]
*  Even when he's out of camp and he's like oh he walks around 220. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9117.0s)]
*  He still looks relatively thin. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9119.0s)]
*  In comparison to Johnny Walker. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9122.0s)]
*  Johnny Walker's a real outlier in that light heavyweight division. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9124.0s)]
*  Well shit he's still thin in his opponent's comparison to anybody else in the 205 division. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9127.0s)]
*  Pahanas. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9132.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9133.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9134.0s)]
*  Interesting if he does that if he gains more weight. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9135.0s)]
*  Like what does he decide to do? [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9138.0s)]
*  I mean I don't know. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9140.0s)]
*  I mean he was talking about fighting Hamzat. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9141.0s)]
*  You remember he said I'll fight you at light heavyweight. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9144.0s)]
*  Because Hamzat was like you know let's fight in Brazil. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9146.0s)]
*  But he's like I can't make the weight on short notice like that. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9149.0s)]
*  Which is interesting. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9151.0s)]
*  Like how much time does he need to make that weight? [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9152.0s)]
*  He's cutting a lot of weight. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9154.0s)]
*  What's the average in between his fights? [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9156.0s)]
*  He's had some time. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9159.0s)]
*  But I mean you know I don't know like how big he got after the Izzy fight. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9161.0s)]
*  He might have just like ate like a pig and just realized like hey it's going to take me a few weeks just to get this weight off. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9167.0s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9172.0s)]
*  But it's a fascinating rematch. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9174.0s)]
*  And you know Izzy is just so intelligent and he's so clever. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9178.0s)]
*  And that he doesn't I mean he's not taking this fight unless he thinks he can beat him again. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9182.0s)]
*  And he's going to try to figure out some way. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9187.0s)]
*  I think he does. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9190.0s)]
*  Honestly if I think Izzy is he kind of like a little bit more of a vulk approach. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9192.0s)]
*  Just all right I'm going to be faster. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9200.0s)]
*  Let you let you let you open up first and then make you pay for whatever you do. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9202.0s)]
*  And then just kind of shut down anything that he wants to do like from the beginning and play it from that type of way. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9205.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9211.0s)]
*  Mix it in maybe like maybe like the threat of like a take down the threat of like a tie up and things like that. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9212.0s)]
*  That's different. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9217.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9219.0s)]
*  Well he definitely won the grappling exchanges. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9220.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9222.0s)]
*  And he had him in bad trouble when he had his back and he was beating him up. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9223.0s)]
*  And you know that was unexpected. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9226.0s)]
*  Interesting to see Izzy become a grappler too. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9228.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9231.0s)]
*  That's why that's another thing like everybody thinks like like all Piedas Piedas be like bro he can't grapple with me. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9232.0s)]
*  He can't. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9242.0s)]
*  He thinks that I can't wrestle. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9244.0s)]
*  We all thought I couldn't grab or couldn't get up from bottom. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9247.0s)]
*  Like it's like I'm excited. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9250.0s)]
*  I'm really excited. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9255.0s)]
*  So many good fights for you man. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9256.0s)]
*  Yeah I'm excited just to just. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9257.0s)]
*  Was this camp preparing for the title. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9259.0s)]
*  I know that you had brought in nutritionist to work with you. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9261.0s)]
*  Is that the first time you done that. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9265.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9266.0s)]
*  Yeah. What was that like. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9267.0s)]
*  It was great bro. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9268.0s)]
*  It was a game changer. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9270.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9272.0s)]
*  He was a he's a nutritionist and a personal chef. [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9273.0s)]
*  Ian. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9275.0s)]
*  Ian. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9276.0s)]
*  I can't be forgetting how to pronounce his last name. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9277.0s)]
*  Jamie will find it. [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9282.0s)]
*  Larios I think is Larios Ian Larios. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9284.0s)]
*  He he comes in and he stays in my house. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9288.0s)]
*  He cooks all my food. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9293.0s)]
*  He makes everything for me. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9295.0s)]
*  I don't have to like all I got to do is just eat what he tells me. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9297.0s)]
*  He puts it in front of me like you'll eat this and it's good food like it's legitimate like some like I got like pictures and stuff of Larios. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9300.0s)]
*  Ian Larios. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9308.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9309.0s)]
*  Chef to the world's top fighters. [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9310.0s)]
*  And so like what was different in the way he was having you eat versus the way you you were eating previously. [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9312.0s)]
*  I just I wasn't eating enough. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9320.0s)]
*  You know in order to eat at a calorie deficit for me to me you just ate less you ate the right things and then I just ate I knew how to portion my things. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9322.0s)]
*  You know so like I was certain things that I eat I knew what to eat and I knew how to get my way to where I wanted. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9332.0s)]
*  And that's what I was doing. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9337.0s)]
*  And granted throughout the camp I felt weak as shit. [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9338.0s)]
*  You know just because I wasn't giving myself enough carbs and energy sometimes on certain for some weeks I just do a keto diet and I wouldn't even eat carbs. [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9340.0s)]
*  You know he came in was like no you need carbs is what you're going to do. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9348.0s)]
*  And I never felt weak once during the camp. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9352.0s)]
*  I felt tired. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9356.0s)]
*  I felt beat up a little bit you know a little wear and tear from from going from doing two days for a whole week. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9358.0s)]
*  But I never felt drained. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9363.0s)]
*  I never felt weak. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9366.0s)]
*  And I was a game changer. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9368.0s)]
*  I was a game changer. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9370.0s)]
*  And what was the difference in terms of the types of foods that he was having you eat. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9371.0s)]
*  You said he added carbs but like what were you eating. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9375.0s)]
*  I was I was eating everything I was eating steak. [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9378.0s)]
*  He made I think he made chicken wings once. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9381.0s)]
*  You made like some is like he just made like he made a bunch of different things like like some Peru like made like a proven dish homemade like tater tots. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9383.0s)]
*  You know just different things. [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9395.0s)]
*  But the way he makes them and like the sauces he puts on them is like it's almost like you're eating at a restaurant. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9397.0s)]
*  It's almost like you eat at a five star restaurant every meal. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9402.0s)]
*  There it is. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9405.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9406.0s)]
*  Yeah. He puts a little drizzle on the plate and everything. [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9407.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9409.0s)]
*  And that's how you that's how you played it. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9410.0s)]
*  That's how he's playing it to me like every time. [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9411.0s)]
*  So it's exciting. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9414.0s)]
*  So you're looking forward to it. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9415.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9417.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9418.0s)]
*  If I could if I could have gotten to come and stay with me now you'd still be with me. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9419.0s)]
*  You know I mean like like like I'd rather eat the food like that. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9421.0s)]
*  I'd rather eat the food like it's it's it's like that. [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9424.0s)]
*  It's just like but it's all good. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9426.0s)]
*  It's like some of the best food I've ever eaten. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9429.0s)]
*  You know and I was full. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9432.0s)]
*  You know I took it. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9435.0s)]
*  I it was just so he's taken into consideration the amount of calories that you're burning with the amount of calories you're going to get from each individual meal. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9436.0s)]
*  So you know competent yeah everything everything and he makes everything from everything from scratch. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9446.0s)]
*  So he gets everything fresh. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9452.0s)]
*  Everything is organic. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9453.0s)]
*  He makes all the sauces himself. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9454.0s)]
*  He makes all the everything. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9456.0s)]
*  So you think you'll be using him for every time. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9459.0s)]
*  I'll never I'll never do a camp without him. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9461.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9463.0s)]
*  I'll never do another camp without him. [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9464.0s)]
*  That's interesting. [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9465.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9466.0s)]
*  What a big change. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9467.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9468.0s)]
*  I'll bring I'm bring him out even earlier next camp. [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9469.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9470.0s)]
*  How many weeks was he with you for this. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9471.0s)]
*  He's with me just under four weeks. [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9472.0s)]
*  So when you think about different things that you have added over the years what about strength and conditioning like how much how much do you do that and how much of it like fight specific training honestly this last camp I didn't do any strength and conditioning really outside of maybe doing the skier and then like hitting doing like the bike just to like warm up and get my first few rounds to get a sweat going. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9474.0s)]
*  I do a lot of fight specific things like I do a lot of rolling a lot of drilling a lot of sparring. [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9501.0s)]
*  Really. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9508.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9509.0s)]
*  No strength and conditioning. [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9510.0s)]
*  I didn't do anything. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9511.0s)]
*  You had great fucking cardio. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9512.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9514.0s)]
*  Well crazy. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9515.0s)]
*  Well I still work. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9516.0s)]
*  I mean my strength and conditioning was me going hard rounds fresh body. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9517.0s)]
*  So like it's like one of the things we'll do is this right. [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9522.0s)]
*  So my job was to defend take downs and be able to defend a relentless take down attack. [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9525.0s)]
*  So what we'll do we'll put it we'll do many around many many intervals. [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9531.0s)]
*  So my my my my grappling coach and main star was training partner Justin Andrews. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9536.0s)]
*  He'll come in. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9545.0s)]
*  He'll start in will start it will start on started in on a single leg. [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9546.0s)]
*  All right. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9550.0s)]
*  After the fitness single leg defend the take down defend the take down he's going to go as hard as he can for a minute. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9551.0s)]
*  Once that minute is up we got a fresh body coming in once that means up first body coming in first body. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9555.0s)]
*  So I have about like five like five or six dudes lined up and we just fresh body every minute. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9560.0s)]
*  You know so that's how we do we go we go like that and I'll do we'll do that for maybe like an hour and then I go over to striking. [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9565.0s)]
*  Then I go and I'll strike for an hour in the same session. [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9574.0s)]
*  Really. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9578.0s)]
*  Then I'll leave go home recover or go to PT or whatever. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9579.0s)]
*  You're my you're my recovery and eat probably take a catch a nap for a second. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9584.0s)]
*  I go back and I do it again. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9588.0s)]
*  Same thing same thing. [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9590.0s)]
*  What work my grappling not the exact same thing with working grappling working different parts of grappling drilling things like that. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9591.0s)]
*  Fresh body and then rolling sparring fresh body even sparring. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9599.0s)]
*  Even sparring so even when I'm sparring we'll go we'll go. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9604.0s)]
*  So how many guys I got you know when I'm you go a minute you go like a minute and a half then fresh body minute a minute minute and a half fresh body. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9608.0s)]
*  Minute minute and a half fresh body. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9616.0s)]
*  So it's always somebody else fresh so they can always be on point. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9618.0s)]
*  And then I just you know I got to work my I got to adjust. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9621.0s)]
*  It's interesting the different approaches when it comes to like how much time should you be spending on doing strength and conditioning work versus fight specific work. [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9626.0s)]
*  And some people like yourself that just get all their conditioning done through fight specific work because that's what George St. Pierre turned to later in his career. [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9634.0s)]
*  Like George early on his career he was doing a lot of strength and conditioning training and then somewhere along the line he realized that efficiency was most important and then you get that from training. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9643.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9652.0s)]
*  And you get that fight specific cardio from doing the grappling rounds doing the you know the sparring rounds doing the rounds in the bag. [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9653.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9661.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9662.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9663.0s)]
*  Like even like and then everything like we always put myself at a disadvantage. [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9664.0s)]
*  So like we'll we'll get through that we'll get through that session. [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9669.0s)]
*  Now the next session is I got to let I got to start from the bottom and sometimes it'll be sitting up back up against the back up against the wall and they got your legs. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9672.0s)]
*  You got to go from there. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9681.0s)]
*  You know like I already got your legs completely pinned. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9682.0s)]
*  So now you so now I have to get up from there and in the next minute another fresh guy is coming to get on my legs to restart me in the same split the same way. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9684.0s)]
*  You know that's that's how we do we work that we work we work we work all positions work all facets of where we want to be proficient at and do it to you. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9692.0s)]
*  So you got to you got to be able to do it when you're both full strength the full guy come in and when you get tired and he's still got more and more and you are his fresh. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9702.0s)]
*  You know still got to be able to do it. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9710.0s)]
*  Now what about in between camps. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9711.0s)]
*  Do you do any like weightlifting kettlebells any yoga anything in between camps to just like sort of strengthen areas and you know prevent injuries or anything along those lines. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9713.0s)]
*  I haven't been that's something that we are going to go and I had a strength and conditioning coach actually for the Jimmy crew and Johnny Walker fight. [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9725.0s)]
*  You know just kind of gotten away from it because like the last year I've really been dealing with like a lot of injuries like my body's been beat up more the last year than it's ever been. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9736.0s)]
*  What kind of injuries. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9745.0s)]
*  Man all type of things bro like elbows shoulders knees ankles like is really like this. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9746.0s)]
*  I go Santos fight to like I didn't really do any strength and conditioning. [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9757.0s)]
*  I didn't I did pretty much no strength and conditioning then minimal even really like hard like grab like hard smart hard anything for for the Santos fight just because I was so I was so beat up my body was so beat up that I just had to make sure I can get to the fight and feel good just even I mean feel healthy in the fight. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9760.0s)]
*  So that was the main focus for that one. [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9780.0s)]
*  So. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9782.0s)]
*  And it showed a little bit you know I did get a little I got a little tired in the fight you know and things like that but you know I still had enough how would I needed to finish the fight late in the fourth round. [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9784.0s)]
*  So that just let me that was also a thing that just let me know like I brought you got it so just make sure you put in the work put in anything you really got it. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9793.0s)]
*  Yeah, even under less than ideal circumstances you know with injuries and dealing stuff you could still win against a top guy. [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9802.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9809.0s)]
*  That was the whole laying back I belong. [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9810.0s)]
*  Yeah, so that was a big moment for you. [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9813.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know I was I like I don't I don't complain and I don't I don't make excuses or nothing like that so like most of the stuff I do it I just don't say anything. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9817.0s)]
*  You know I just I just deal with it because I really truly got the mentality of feeling who cares. [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9827.0s)]
*  You know I'm saying so. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9832.0s)]
*  You need that. [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9834.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9835.0s)]
*  That's a giant advantage because guys who fret over every little thing that's going wrong and it starts spiraling to go in a downward spiral in their head like I'm injured I can't. [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9836.0s)]
*  I wish I was not injured I wish if you can just deal and just keep and just get to the fight. [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9845.0s)]
*  That's a giant advantage. [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9851.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was the main as is the main thing I do is this. [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9853.0s)]
*  What do you do? [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9861.0s)]
*  What are you doing for recovery? [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9862.0s)]
*  Do you get massages? [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9863.0s)]
*  Do you do cold plunge? [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9864.0s)]
*  Do you do saunas? [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9865.0s)]
*  Yeah, I get massages like this last like this last time I went over I felt good everything went good. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9866.0s)]
*  I had a I have a teammate. [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9873.0s)]
*  She's gone to school. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9875.0s)]
*  She's a licensed massage therapist. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9877.0s)]
*  Does health massage sports massage and things like that. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9880.0s)]
*  So she would come in she came in in the mornings and she was massaging me before before training. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9884.0s)]
*  And then after that I leave here and I go to physical therapy. [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9890.0s)]
*  I'll be there for a couple hours and yeah then I would you go to physical therapy for what do you go to physical therapy for injuries just a little weird stuff. [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9894.0s)]
*  You got all the shades you're dealing with. [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9905.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9907.0s)]
*  So you just deal with it while you're in the middle of camp, which is less than ideal. [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9908.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9911.0s)]

*  And you're doing cold plunges and saunas. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9914.0s)]
*  I do the cold plunge whenever I go out to Vegas. [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9916.0s)]
*  That's it. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9919.0s)]

*  I do ice bath here and there like honestly for the most part. [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9929.0s)]
*  But when they're in Michigan all you got to do is go outside. [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=9932.0s)]

*  And then you got to scrape the windshield. [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10023.0s)]
*  There's a lot. [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10025.0s)]
*  It's terrible. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10026.0s)]
*  Shoveling yourself. [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10027.0s)]
*  But it makes resilient people. [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10028.0s)]
*  People that grow up in cold climates, they are much more resilient people. [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10030.0s)]
*  People that live in California, they don't know shit about weather. [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10034.0s)]
*  You got to endure, man. [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10037.0s)]

*  Bro. [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10056.0s)]
*  Yeah, you got to hurry up, rush before you, and get out. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10058.0s)]
*  You walk outside. [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10061.0s)]
*  They got to try to turn against the wind. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10063.0s)]
*  Trying to turn, trying to hide from the wind. [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10066.0s)]
*  People in warm weather, they don't know about that wind. [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10068.0s)]
*  Those Hawaii people, they have no idea about that wind. [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10070.0s)]
*  Rain! Rain! [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10073.0s)]
*  Yes, rain, motherfucker. [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10077.0s)]
*  You just walk your ass out there and get wet a little bit. [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10078.0s)]
*  Fuck, Ray. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10081.0s)]
*  What about three feet of snow in front of your door where you can't open your door to get outside? [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10082.0s)]
*  I had to, I think I posted it on my TikTok video. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10086.0s)]
*  It snowed. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10093.0s)]
*  It snowed, bro. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10095.0s)]
*  I opened my garage, dude. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10096.0s)]
*  It's like three feet of snow there. [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10098.0s)]
*  So now I just got to get out there. [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10100.0s)]
*  It's like, hell no, hell no. [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10102.0s)]
*  It's a serious workout, snow shoveling. [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10106.0s)]
*  It was. [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10108.0s)]
*  It was. [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10109.0s)]
*  It was heavy. [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10110.0s)]
*  Especially when it gets wet, that wet snow. [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10111.0s)]
*  It gets sticky. [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10113.0s)]
*  It's why you got to get out and get it while it's coming down so it don't stick. [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10114.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10118.0s)]
*  Because once it sticks, now you out there. [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10119.0s)]
*  For your cold plunge, just fucking lay down that snow. [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10122.0s)]
*  That'll reduce the shit out of some inflammation. [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10126.0s)]
*  That'll reduce the shit out of some inflammation. [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10128.0s)]
*  The only thing is though, even when you go inside, it still don't stop and it hurts a little bit. [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10129.0s)]
*  Yeah, it does. [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10134.0s)]
*  Are you, do you take supplements? [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10136.0s)]
*  Are you taking vitamins and minerals? [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10138.0s)]

*  That's work too though. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10143.0s)]
*  That's a good workout. [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10144.0s)]
*  I was on my way to training. [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10145.0s)]
*  I was on my way to the gym to go do a two hour grappling and striking workout. [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10147.0s)]
*  Hard work. [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10155.0s)]
*  I really firmly believe it makes better people. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10157.0s)]
*  I think people that grow up in cold climates, they just can deal with more shit. [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10160.0s)]
*  They're just used to it. [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10164.0s)]

*  I kind of do it myself. [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10336.0s)]
*  While Ian was there, he kind of stays on that as well. [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10338.0s)]
*  What kind of stuff are you taking? [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10342.0s)]
*  Like multivitamins? [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10343.0s)]
*  Yeah, multivitamins, fish oil, krill oil, turmeric. [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10344.0s)]
*  I got some aminos. [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10348.0s)]
*  Yeah, pretty much that. [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10358.0s)]
*  Have you ever thought about doing a camp at the Performance Institute? [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10359.0s)]
*  I have. [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10363.0s)]
*  Because they have so many resources that are available. [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10366.0s)]
*  It's a beautiful thing to have that thing for the UFC where the UFCPI has this amazing [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10368.0s)]
*  setup with all these experts and great nutrition and all this equipment and great facilities [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10373.0s)]
*  to train at. [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10379.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I went in and got the, I went and got the tests, you know, where they test out [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10380.0s)]
*  your body, how far your neck turns, how far you can bend this way, can you touch your toes, [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10385.0s)]
*  can your toes touch you, you know, just all those things. [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10390.0s)]
*  So I've been to, I've been to, I've gotten those and then at the end of that they give [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10393.0s)]
*  you like an assessment like, hey, your body has this is here, you can lift here, do this [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10398.0s)]
*  exercise. [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10403.0s)]
*  So they really, I know, I know how helpful and how deep they get down into everything. [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10404.0s)]
*  So yeah, it's about as scientific as you can get. [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10408.0s)]
*  And the fact that it's available to all fighters that they could just train there anytime they [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10410.0s)]
*  want, that's giant. [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10414.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10415.0s)]
*  I think that's huge. [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10416.0s)]
*  So you've thought about it? [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10417.0s)]
*  I've thought about it. [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10419.0s)]
*  It's just the being out there, you know, I got six kids. [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10420.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10422.0s)]
*  So being all the way out there. [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10423.0s)]
*  No, you can't do that. [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10424.0s)]
*  I'm by my kids and things. [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10425.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a bummer, man. [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10426.0s)]
*  I know some guys, they go away and they do these mountain camps, like they go to Big [[02:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10428.0s)]
*  Bear or something like that and they train for months away from their family. [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10432.0s)]
*  I'm like, I know that you don't want a distraction, but how much does that take away from you [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10435.0s)]
*  as a person? [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10440.0s)]
*  Like, how do you feel when you're up there? [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10441.0s)]
*  Like, how much do you miss your family? [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10443.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think while you're busy, you're like, you're not really distracted, all right. [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10445.0s)]
*  But then whenever you stop doing stuff and then like, maybe something small, like somebody [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10450.0s)]
*  else is there, a kid, or you see a kid, or you see something like, oh, my kid might like [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10453.0s)]
*  that or something like that. [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10457.0s)]
*  And he's like, damn. [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10458.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10459.0s)]
*  And you just start missing them. [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10460.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10462.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10463.0s)]
*  The life of a fighter. [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10464.0s)]
*  It's not an easy road, my friend, but you're on one of the best paths that you can get. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10465.0s)]
*  World motherfucking champion. [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10471.0s)]
*  All hill. [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10473.0s)]
*  No matter what happens, they can't take that from you. [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10474.0s)]
*  Not the town, not the city, not the county, not the state, not the country, not the continent, [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10477.0s)]
*  but the world. [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10489.0s)]

*  And if you're the UFC champion, you're the real champion. [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10493.0s)]
*  There's a lot of champions out there. [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YES-G0fATk&t=10496.0s)]
