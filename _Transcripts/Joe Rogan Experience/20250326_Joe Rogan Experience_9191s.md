# Joe Rogan Experience #2294 - Dr. Suzanne Humphries
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI)
*  You just said something that's like very important. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=0.0s)]
*  You can't be dogmatic when you talk about vaccines or about anything. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=16.64s)]
*  Yes, it is good to keep an open mind, isn't it? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=21.36s)]
*  And be flexible and look at a 360 degree view of things rather than your tunnel vision and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=23.96s)]
*  how much you're indoctrinated into, isn't it? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=29.36s)]
*  Yeah, and especially if you know that that indoctrination has been on purpose and profitable. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=32.12s)]
*  One of the great things about your book is, first of all, your book is called Dissolving [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=39.04s)]
*  Illusions. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=45.2s)]
*  I know I've talked about it on the podcast a bunch of times, but you also highlight a [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=46.2s)]
*  lot of things that we know are beneficial that somehow or another get lumped into nonsense. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=52.04s)]
*  Like even cinnamon. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=58.84s)]
*  Yeah, cinnamon is a powerful herb actually, and it's known to be helpful in glucose handling [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=60.92s)]
*  for a lot of diabetics taking it in capsule form now. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=69.08s)]
*  I noticed at the end of my nephrology career that a lot of my own patients were taking [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  cinnamon capsules, but it also has a lot of vitamin C in it, and I think that was probably [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=77.68s)]
*  one of the keys. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=82.60000000000001s)]
*  A lot of those old remedies that we wrote about, the magic in them probably was the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  vitamin C in them. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=86.84s)]
*  I dismissed all that stuff as total nonsense. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=87.92s)]
*  I was like, oh, that's hippie nonsense, like echinacea, like get out of here. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=90.92s)]
*  It's hippie nonsense. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=94.24s)]
*  Garlic, come on, get out of here. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=95.24s)]
*  Then the more I've read things, especially like garlic is incredible for staph infections [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=97.72s)]
*  for some reason. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=104.22s)]
*  It is, and it doesn't develop drug resistance like a lot of the drugs that are engineered [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=105.22s)]
*  for it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the hippies seem to have got it right, I think. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=111.47999999999999s)]
*  Well, it just, that whole idea of natural remedies is so just universally dismissed [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  by non-silly people. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=122.91999999999999s)]
*  When you say natural remedies, that's great. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=124.72s)]
*  If you have a heart attack, go to a doctor, stupid. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=127.28s)]
*  That's generally people's appeal to authority. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=129.72s)]
*  The doctor should be recommending those things too. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=133.84s)]
*  They're good too. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=137.12s)]
*  Like vitamin D, super important. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=138.68s)]
*  Vitamin A, super important. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=141.64s)]
*  One of the things that you talked about in the book is that, I think this was really important, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  when you were talking about the measles vaccine, you were saying that either if you get an [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=149.32s)]
*  infection with measles, just a natural infection, or if you get the vaccine, you're still going [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=154.92s)]
*  to get depleted of vitamin A. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=160.44s)]
*  If you get vaccinated for the measles, you should be taking vitamin A as well. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=162.72s)]
*  Your body's going to get depleted just by getting that shot. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=166.76s)]
*  They don't tell you that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=169.54s)]
*  No, they don't tell you anything. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=170.54s)]
*  There's Tylenol, which actually makes the vaccine not work as well, in addition to causing [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=172.28s)]
*  all kinds of immunological disturbances at the time that you're supposed to be upregulating [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=176.2s)]
*  your immune system against this dreaded disease. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=180.6s)]
*  One of the things about the recommended by the white coats and the authorities is that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=185.11999999999998s)]
*  the public believes that so many drugs and remedies are standardized that the conventional [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=191.28s)]
*  medical system gives out. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=196.64s)]
*  When you go to actually look at them, and this includes vaccines, even though they're [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=199.32s)]
*  standardized, meaning that the manufacturers are told what the regulations should be in [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=202.72s)]
*  terms of production, when people go and look at them, they find it's anything but standardized. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=208.48s)]
*  It's very variable, which is why we see such variability in the results when people receive [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  them. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=218.84s)]
*  That's only one reason why there's so much variability. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=219.84s)]
*  Do you think it's the immunity to any legal consequences that has allowed them to operate [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=222.92s)]
*  like this? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=229.92s)]
*  Well, we certainly saw an explosion of their creativity since 1986. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=230.92s)]
*  Actually in 1986, you're referring to the National Child Vaccine Injury Act that was [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=237.56s)]
*  passed in 1986, but before 1986, we had 1976, which was the swine flu vaccine fiasco. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=241.76s)]
*  That was a situation where there was so much injury that the vaccine producing companies [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=251.16s)]
*  were no longer able to get insurance. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=256.4s)]
*  They went to the government and they said, we need you to indemnify us, and they did. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=258.44s)]
*  The government absorbed all the lawsuit cases that happened as a result of the guillem [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=263.08s)]
*  barrette that happened from then. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=267.28s)]
*  That set a precedent for 1986. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=268.76s)]
*  Back then, vaccines were just pieces of microbe or maybe a live attenuated virus. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=270.96s)]
*  They would put a background of all kinds of horrid things inside of it and tell you it [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=278.36s)]
*  was just a clear, beautiful, pure solution, but that's beside the point. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=281.72s)]
*  Then 1986 comes along because there's so many lawsuits happening because of the diphtheria [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  pertussis tetanus vaccine that, again, the vaccine companies couldn't continue to go [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=289.8s)]
*  on the way they were because they were being sued so much. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=294.5s)]
*  Then this horrible act was passed, which to some people seemed like a good idea. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=297.48s)]
*  This is always how it goes. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=302.16s)]
*  We're going to make you this promise. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, we're going to cover all the lawsuits now out of taxes, but it's going [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=305.84s)]
*  to be okay because we're going to pay out these lawsuits and you're going to be fine. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=308.96s)]
*  If your kid takes one for the team, you're going to be okay. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=312.32s)]
*  What happens is after time, after they get their foot in the door, they narrowed down [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=315.52s)]
*  the ... They basically have a kangaroo court that decides if you're eligible. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=320.12s)]
*  The qualification tables got narrowed down because in the beginning they were paying [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=325.44s)]
*  out so much of this. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=328.88s)]
*  Not only did it make the vaccine companies very, very wealthy and indemnify, but as you [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=331.16s)]
*  alluded to just a minute ago, the creativity of the vaccine companies expanded. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=335.36s)]
*  After that, they could add different, what we call adjuvants, things that stimulate the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=341.68s)]
*  immune system so the vaccine works better. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  That's why we're able to be in a messenger RNA vaccine situation today, which that wouldn't [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=349.04s)]
*  have happened if it weren't for this indemnification that the vaccine trials have always been a [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  bit of a joke, but they're even more of a joke today than they were in the beginning. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=358.48s)]
*  We've never seen a vaccinated, unvaccinated study that is accepted by the powers that [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=362.76s)]
*  be as good enough. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=368.44s)]
*  The vaccinated, unvaccinated studies that they have, they use another vaccine for. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=372.8s)]
*  You probably know that. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=376.76s)]
*  If you're testing a measles vaccine, you could test it against a diphtheria vaccine or a [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=377.76s)]
*  flu shot vaccine is tested against a hepatitis A vaccine. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=382.8s)]
*  There's no saline placebo because the few studies that exist with saline placebos show [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=385.88s)]
*  how bad the vaccine actually is and how it makes you not only not respond to the disease [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=391.0s)]
*  when it comes around, but more susceptible to it in many cases. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=397.04s)]
*  Have there been any instances where vaccines have been helpful? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=400.56s)]
*  The question of the century, isn't it? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=405.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=408.04s)]
*  Now we have to back up a minute because I had that same question and I had to go dig [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=409.04s)]
*  deep to all the questions you have in your head right now. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=413.8s)]
*  I had them too at one point. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=415.84s)]
*  So here I am, a medical doctor working in the field, believing in pretty much everything [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=417.8s)]
*  I was told, giving hundreds if not thousands of vaccines out to my patients, hepatitis [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=422.48s)]
*  B vaccines in particular, flu shots for sure. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=427.84s)]
*  I was a nephrologist, kidney specialist in dialysis, et cetera. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=430.88s)]
*  And initially, you know, we all kind of have an aversion to needles. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=436.84s)]
*  I think it's a natural human aversion. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=440.96s)]
*  And we're kids, we don't know what's going on. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=442.56s)]
*  I want to go get my vaccines. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=443.96s)]
*  Well, you know, okay, fine, sore arm. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=445.08s)]
*  You get over it. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=447.2s)]
*  Most of us were lucky enough to get over it. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=447.88s)]
*  So by the time the first instance of a problem occurred in front of my eyes, I was already [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=451.44s)]
*  a fully seasoned professor of medicine, you know, working in an a tertiary care medical [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=458.91999999999996s)]
*  center. Okay. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=463.32s)]
*  And so it's been a bit of a process because for me, it was the influenza vaccines in [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=464.59999999999997s)]
*  2008, 2009 that showed me without a doubt that vaccines can and do cause kidney failure [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=469.76s)]
*  and put people on dialysis. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=475.76s)]
*  That that does happen. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=477.08s)]
*  It can cause hypertension. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=478.24s)]
*  So we're not told to take a vaccine history in medical school. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=480.03999999999996s)]
*  We're not told to even look there. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=483.59999999999997s)]
*  It's not even part of especially in adults. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=485.08s)]
*  But when I did start looking there, I started to see more and more associations. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=487.48s)]
*  Let's just put it that way. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=491.4s)]
*  And so first I had to go down the flu, the flu vaccine bunny trail. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=492.71999999999997s)]
*  And every time I went down that flu vaccine bunny trail, guess what I was asked? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=496.20000000000005s)]
*  What about polio? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=500.48s)]
*  So I thought, all right, even though this has absolutely zero to do with polio, because [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=502.48s)]
*  I'm watching people crap out in front of me after influenza vaccines, let's see about [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=506.84000000000003s)]
*  polio because I knew very little about polio, just like most people walking around out [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=510.88s)]
*  there do that. You know, it was invented by this guy named Jonas Salk and it saved humanity. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=515.16s)]
*  We don't see these little crippled kids anymore. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=519.48s)]
*  We don't have iron lungs anymore. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=521.32s)]
*  Yay. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=522.64s)]
*  Well, I would have to say that the polio bunny trail was the darkest one of all. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=523.64s)]
*  And so after polio then became smallpox. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=529.5600000000001s)]
*  And I thought, you know, we still have people walking the earth that have experienced the [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=533.24s)]
*  polio years. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=536.96s)]
*  So I kind of like to stick to polio because most of the smallpox, you know, people that [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=537.96s)]
*  would have been would have been familiar with it or off the planet. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=543.12s)]
*  But there's still some doctors around that will talk about smallpox. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=546.4s)]
*  So the guy named Thomas Mack, who's probably close to 90, who was kind of ground zero in [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=548.88s)]
*  the 1940s and knows a lot about it and still says we shouldn't be vaccinating for smallpox [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=554.4399999999999s)]
*  today. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=559.16s)]
*  So then there was that. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=560.8s)]
*  And then everyone and their dog was talking about autism. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=561.76s)]
*  And I didn't really want to have anything to do with autism because I was an adult doctor. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=564.08s)]
*  I think we should break down step by step. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=568.16s)]
*  Like, what about polio? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=570.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=572.0s)]

*  Check it out. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=637.58s)]
*  Because you said polio. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=638.58s)]
*  Once we've breached that, because that's the big one. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=640.08s)]
*  This is the one that everybody points to. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=643.0s)]
*  We don't have crippled kids. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=644.36s)]
*  When you look at the historical timeline of polio, what do you think caused it to go to [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=647.72s)]
*  essentially not be a problem anymore? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=655.5600000000001s)]
*  You don't think vaccinations had anything to do with that? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=659.08s)]
*  Well I also, it's not what I think because that's the thing. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=661.9200000000001s)]
*  Like, look, when I got into this, I didn't say, oh, you know, I want to argue that vaccines [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=665.0400000000001s)]
*  are great. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=669.8000000000001s)]
*  I said, look, I don't care. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=670.8000000000001s)]
*  I didn't have skin in the game. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=671.8000000000001s)]
*  I didn't have vaccine injured kids. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=672.8000000000001s)]
*  I couldn't have cared less about it and essentially accepted it was something in front of me and [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=674.0600000000001s)]
*  didn't make sense. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=677.64s)]
*  So I thought wherever the truth falls, that's what I'm going to talk about. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=678.64s)]
*  So what I say is that what the facts line up to show you is that polio is still here. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=681.84s)]
*  Polio is still alive and well. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=688.04s)]
*  Polio is called different things today. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=689.84s)]
*  Whereas back in the 1940s, 1950s, the criteria for diagnosing polio were completely different [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=692.92s)]
*  to the year that the vaccine was introduced. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=699.64s)]
*  The playing field, the goalposts, everything was changed so that despite the fact that [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=702.12s)]
*  there was more paralytic polio in the years after that vaccine was introduced, they were [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=706.64s)]
*  able to show a complete cascading drop of paralytic polio simply because of the way [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=711.08s)]
*  they changed the definitions of what polio is and what could cause it. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=716.2800000000001s)]
*  And they started testing for the virus where before they would never test for the virus. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=719.84s)]
*  And when they started testing for the virus later, what they would find that people had [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=723.5200000000001s)]
*  Guillain-Barre syndrome, they didn't have virus, or they had Coxsackie virus or Echovirus, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=727.32s)]
*  or they were lead poisoned or mercury poisoned, which was the mercury and lead were the leading [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=732.08s)]
*  treatments of the day, including bloodletting. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=737.96s)]
*  They were telling people to put, take your cigarette and put a little bit of arsenic [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=741.1600000000001s)]
*  in there. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=744.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they were literally blowing smoke up people's butts. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=745.88s)]
*  Like that's where the term comes from. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=749.24s)]
*  Because if you want to Google that now, you'll see that there's an instrument that does it. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=750.8399999999999s)]
*  So, Leah, the polio story, where to even begin? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=755.52s)]
*  And so there's about 70 pages. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=760.56s)]
*  And so that became my obsession. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=762.68s)]
*  So when people said, what about polio? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=764.7199999999999s)]
*  And I started digging this up, I went deep into it. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=766.48s)]
*  Did you dive into pesticides? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=768.92s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=770.72s)]
*  You have to dive into pesticides. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=772.12s)]
*  Because the tonnage of production of DDT absolutely mirrored the diagnosis for polio in the days. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=774.5600000000001s)]
*  And the countries that still make DDT today is where we're still seeing this paralytic [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=781.0s)]
*  polio situation happen. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=784.78s)]
*  And also, weren't the first cases, did they break out in the rural community? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=786.76s)]
*  The first cases of polio, yes. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=791.48s)]
*  In the United States, paralytic polio. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=792.48s)]
*  Yes, it was out in the countryside. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=794.12s)]
*  Well, and that was probably more because of the sheep and cow dipping. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=795.44s)]
*  So arsenic, you'd have to look at arsenic. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=798.76s)]
*  You have to look at the mercurials. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=800.68s)]
*  You have to look at the calcium arsenate, lead arsenate sprays that were put on trees. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=801.92s)]
*  But what you're talking about in particular, they would call the cow disease. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=805.8s)]
*  They would go out and the family, when you would go to the house, they'd say, all the [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=808.36s)]
*  kids have the cow disease, what the cows had before. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=812.24s)]
*  Well, what were they doing? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=814.56s)]
*  They would have these trenches. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=815.56s)]
*  You talk to farmers, even today. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=816.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah, we had trenches. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=818.52s)]
*  We would just walk them straight through and I'd be soaked with this stuff by the end of [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=819.88s)]
*  the day. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=822.6s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=823.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=824.6s)]
*  So they're basically soaking and bathing in arsenic, which is great for killing fleas [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=825.6s)]
*  and ticks. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=828.64s)]
*  It's not really great for keeping your nervous system happy because the fact of the matter [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=830.56s)]
*  is, and this again, I've got medical references, everything. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=833.8399999999999s)]
*  I can't get away with making stuff up, OK? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=836.4799999999999s)]
*  I have to put a reference for everything. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=839.04s)]
*  But arsenic causes the exact same spinal pathology and fevers and everything. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=840.56s)]
*  It literally mimics what they were calling polio and a polio virus back in the day. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=846.1999999999999s)]
*  I read this crazy statistic, and I still can't believe it's real, that 95 to 99 percent of [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=852.0799999999999s)]
*  all polio is asymptomatic. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=858.64s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=861.8000000000001s)]
*  So polio virus is what we call a commensal, just like you have staph on your skin and [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=862.8000000000001s)]
*  strep on your skin and it actually serves a purpose. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=867.72s)]
*  It keeps other microbes in check so long as you don't get a cut and have not a good immune [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=870.12s)]
*  system to deal from the inside out. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=874.8000000000001s)]
*  So polio, the reason I can say that polio is a commensal is because, again, there are [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=876.48s)]
*  medical studies that showed that people who dared to get on the edge of some of these [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=881.12s)]
*  wild native tribes down in South America or elsewhere, but in particular, I'm talking [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=885.84s)]
*  about a South American tribe called the Javante Indians. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=891.0400000000001s)]
*  So the Indian Health Service got to the edge of it and bargained that they would get some [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=894.28s)]
*  stool and some blood from the tribes so that they could test it for polio. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=898.44s)]
*  What they found was 98 to 99 percent of every person they tested, and it was hundreds of [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=902.88s)]
*  people, had evidence of immunity to all three strains of polio. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=908.1600000000001s)]
*  And they said to them, well, where are all your crippled children? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=913.6800000000001s)]
*  Where's your short legs? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=915.6s)]
*  Where are the people that died of respiratory failure? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=916.6s)]
*  And they were like, we don't have any of that problem. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=918.2800000000001s)]
*  So it was well known. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=921.36s)]
*  Could it possibly be that whatever you're calling polio evolved and became less powerful [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=922.36s)]
*  over time and more contagious? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=928.5600000000001s)]
*  That does happen with some viruses, right? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=931.5200000000001s)]
*  Most viruses in nature don't become more problematic as they go through the human system. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=934.5400000000001s)]
*  They become less problematic. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=940.36s)]
*  I remember the whole COVID thing. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=942.52s)]
*  Like in the beginning, people were getting super, super sick. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=944.08s)]
*  It wasn't as contagious, but it was more virulent. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=946.48s)]
*  And as it attenuated into the human bodies, it sort of fizzled out a bit. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=949.5600000000001s)]
*  And then we got the Omicron, which was less, it was more spreadable, but it was much less [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=955.5600000000001s)]
*  pathological. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=961.04s)]
*  And that's the natural process that happens. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=962.2s)]
*  So when you're going to have real problems with microbes, they're usually going to be [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=964.1s)]
*  reverse attenuated, meaning made more lethal in a lab. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=969.66s)]
*  And then they're introduced into the population. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=972.66s)]
*  And look, I'm not making this up either. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=975.5s)]
*  1916, Upper East Side, Manhattan, there was a Rockefeller lab that their specific stated [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=977.66s)]
*  goal was to try to create the most pathological, neuropathological strain of polio possible. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=984.1s)]
*  And they did that by taking monkey brains and human spinal serum and injecting it into [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=990.74s)]
*  monkeys. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=995.38s)]
*  There was a big problem with that, which was released into the public by accident. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=997.1800000000001s)]
*  And the world experienced the worst polio epidemic on record, 25% mortality. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1001.32s)]
*  That's unheard of. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1006.94s)]
*  Really freaked the public out. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1008.94s)]
*  But as it, as it, and you can see the epicenter as it fanned out and as it fanned out and [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1009.94s)]
*  as time went on, never heard of it again. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1014.7s)]
*  It attenuates as it moves through the body because it's a normal human commensal that [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1017.46s)]
*  goes back to its normal state when it's in a human. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1022.12s)]
*  And that's generally what happens. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1025.12s)]
*  If you have a highly lethal virus and it kills a lot of people, those people are dead. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1026.8s)]
*  They can't spread anything. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1030.84s)]
*  So that's kind of a different story. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1032.54s)]
*  If you want to talk about hantavirus or something like that. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1033.76s)]
*  But as far as polio goes, no, polio was only made more lethal by the stupid things that [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1035.8s)]
*  humans did around it. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1040.62s)]
*  So make it more invasive into the body, just like you can go do stupid things and end up [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1041.8999999999999s)]
*  with herpes outbreaks and, you know, staph outbreaks. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1045.3999999999999s)]
*  So, the polio virus is a normal commensal. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1051.26s)]
*  It used to be until we obliterated it with oral vaccines and replaced it with vaccine [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1052.26s)]
*  strain, but the wild strains are normal human commensals. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1056.7s)]
*  So there's vaccine strain polio that just comes from a vaccine and is transmissible? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1060.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1067.2s)]
*  Today, it would be the oral polio vaccines because they're the live strains and they're [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1069.2s)]
*  still giving them pulse fashion all throughout India. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1073.64s)]
*  They did a campaign a few years back in Israel and they always say that a nomad came and, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1077.58s)]
*  you know, pooped in the sewage system and they find it in the sewage system and they [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1082.84s)]
*  don't want an outbreak to happen so they treat everybody. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1087.3799999999999s)]
*  So that's today the most common reason to see poliomyelitis disease from a virus. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1090.86s)]
*  If you test for a virus, they'll usually find the vaccine virus. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1097.8999999999999s)]
*  And that's why today we don't remember when we were kids because we're about the same [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1101.1799999999998s)]
*  age I think. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1103.8999999999999s)]
*  They would give us the sugar cube. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1105.18s)]
*  Maybe you didn't, but I did. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1107.54s)]
*  I got the sugar cube and that was the live vaccine. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1108.54s)]
*  Well, they stopped doing that because after a while the only cases of polio and it became [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1110.72s)]
*  so obvious that the only cases of polio we were seeing related to a virus when they tested [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1115.02s)]
*  for polio virus were vaccine strains. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1119.94s)]
*  Then they started injecting us again. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1121.76s)]
*  But the early injections caused more paralytic polio than it prevented. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1123.8s)]
*  And that's the part that people don't understand when they say, what about polio? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1127.64s)]
*  Because they like you just go, well, there's no more iron lungs. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1130.4s)]
*  There's no more crippling. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1133.0s)]
*  There's no more these little poor little kids walking around with their cast. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1134.0s)]
*  Well, that's not true because the iron lung is now called a ventilator. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1137.1s)]
*  So that's out the window. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1141.58s)]
*  Transverse myelitis, which there are about 1300 cases. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1143.18s)]
*  I think it's a month diagnosed in one particular. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1147.18s)]
*  I put a quote in here on that. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1150.74s)]
*  But transverse myelitis is actually something that would have absolutely, it follows the [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1153.34s)]
*  same pathology as polio, would have been called polio back in the day. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1156.9s)]
*  So we still have polio that we had in 1953 because in 1953 all you had to have to be [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1160.94s)]
*  diagnosed as polio. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1166.8s)]
*  Anyone could diagnose you. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1168.0800000000002s)]
*  Just one examination with one set of muscles being paralyzed. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1169.68s)]
*  There was no time frame on it. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1173.8400000000001s)]
*  There was no testing done on it. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1175.42s)]
*  And then it was considered a public service to do it because then you were eligible for [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1177.0800000000002s)]
*  funding. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1180.44s)]
*  So what do they call it again? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1182.26s)]
*  Can you say that word again? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1183.68s)]
*  Myelitis? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1185.16s)]
*  Poliomyelitis is the definition of the actual pathology. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1186.5400000000002s)]
*  So it basically means inflammation of the gray matter of your spinal cord. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1191.52s)]
*  That's what polio in Greek, poliomyelitis. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1195.5800000000002s)]
*  It means gray matter inflammation, poliomyelitis. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1198.5400000000002s)]
*  Poliomyelitis is what happens in the body. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1203.0600000000002s)]
*  If you want to talk about what causes it, then okay, maybe in some cases a polio virus [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1205.02s)]
*  causes it. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1210.1000000000001s)]
*  All the other things we just mentioned, arsenic, lead arsenate, calcium arsenate, injections, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1212.0800000000002s)]
*  tonsillectomies were a huge cause of some of the worst cases of poliomyelitis. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1218.0s)]
*  And in fact, injections and tonsillectomies and unnecessary surgeries were put on hold [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1222.32s)]
*  during the years where the epidemics were the worst. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1228.68s)]
*  So that's just proof that even the surgeons knew that. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1230.8400000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1233.6000000000001s)]
*  How does it affect it? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1234.6000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1236.8s)]
*  If you happen to have poliomyelitis circulating in your body that's not just sitting in your [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1237.98s)]
*  intestines and say it made its way into your body, because we can. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1242.1399999999999s)]
*  Things can go from your intestines into your body. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1245.4199999999998s)]
*  And you happen to have it close to a nerve that's up, say, around your throat. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1248.3s)]
*  And then you go and take tonsils out. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1253.74s)]
*  Then what you've done is you've given that access to the blood compartment, the lymph [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1255.98s)]
*  compartment, and the brain stem, which is right there, local. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1260.54s)]
*  So those are the people that would get what was called bulbar polio, which is the ones [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1264.38s)]
*  that put you on a ventilator. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1268.42s)]
*  And it's highly lethal. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1270.2800000000002s)]
*  It's the worst kind of polio to get, bulbar polio. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1271.92s)]
*  And it was very well known to have been coincident with tonsillectomies. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1274.98s)]
*  Not only that, but tonsillectomies changed the structure and antibodies and the immunity [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1278.38s)]
*  that occurred in the throat and changed it for the worse, not for the better. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1283.5600000000002s)]
*  Do you think they're unnecessary? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1288.6000000000001s)]
*  Or is there sometimes when people have to get their tonsils removed, or is it just a [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1290.36s)]
*  nonsense practice? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1294.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1295.74s)]
*  So again, it's not just a cut and dry answer, because let's just say that anyone who's ever [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1296.74s)]
*  brought their child to me because the tonsils were touching or they were snoring has not [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1302.9199999999998s)]
*  had to have a tonsillectomy. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1307.1799999999998s)]
*  Now does that mean that a tonsillectomy won't solve that problem where you're snoring and [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1309.24s)]
*  your kids may be not oxygenating? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1313.4799999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1315.28s)]
*  If you let it go that long, probably you're going to need a tonsillectomy. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1316.28s)]
*  I've seen so many cases reverse. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1318.7s)]
*  It's a very easy thing to do. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1321.02s)]
*  But as doctors, we're not taught about all the things that you were talking about earlier, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1322.48s)]
*  the natural remedies, but just simply gargling with a solution of sodium ascorbate, vitamin [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1327.1200000000001s)]
*  C, can make a huge difference. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1332.72s)]
*  Because tonsils are like, they're like porous golf balls, if you want to think of them that [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1334.66s)]
*  way. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1338.9s)]
*  They've got pits in them. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1339.9s)]
*  And so food you eat and bacteria and pus can build up. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1340.9s)]
*  But if you just start rinsing the outsides of them and start nourishing the body from [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1343.3400000000001s)]
*  the inside and getting rid of things that the kid might be allergic to, which almost [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1347.14s)]
*  every kid's going to eat if your parent doesn't know better, it can make a remarkable difference [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1351.2s)]
*  in these kids that have these huge tonsils. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1356.0200000000002s)]
*  So I think that a lot, I think everything else should be done first before taking out [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1358.0600000000002s)]
*  the tonsils if there's time, because I'd say 95 to 99% of the time you can prevent that [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1362.9s)]
*  child from needing their tonsils removed. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1368.8400000000001s)]
*  Before we go to smallpox, I want to talk about this because you just brought it up. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1371.0600000000002s)]
*  One of the things that Brett Weinstein has explained to me is that aluminum is when the [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1375.82s)]
*  concept is that giving someone a shot with aluminum in it and triggering an immune response, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1386.1399999999999s)]
*  if they're eating certain foods during that time, they can then develop an allergy to [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1394.78s)]
*  those foods, like certain people with peanuts and various things like that. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1401.5s)]
*  It used to be very common for people to eat, but then a bunch of people developed pretty [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1405.46s)]
*  severe food allergies. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1409.7s)]
*  And he makes this connection that he believes is a reasonable connection to say that there's [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1411.38s)]
*  something. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1418.0600000000002s)]
*  Absolutely, 100%. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1419.0600000000002s)]
*  And it's not just something he's dreamed up. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1421.18s)]
*  Again, provable medical literature in the book, Dissolving Illusions, the physiology, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1423.46s)]
*  the pathologies known. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1428.5s)]
*  It's very well known that the vaccines that have aluminum in them skew the immune system. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1430.2s)]
*  The immune system, if you want to break it down really simply, you have your TH1 arm [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1435.9s)]
*  and your TH2 arm. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1440.22s)]
*  Your TH1 arm is a really important one. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1441.22s)]
*  Those are your T cells, your lymphocytes, the cells that chew up any garbage that's [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1443.74s)]
*  going around. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1448.54s)]
*  That's the part you want activated in any infection you have, whether it's COVID or [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1449.54s)]
*  measles or smallpox or whatever. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1452.66s)]
*  Then you have your TH2 arm, which is there mostly to deal with parasites and things like [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1455.22s)]
*  that. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1459.42s)]
*  It's mostly an antibody arm of immunity. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1460.42s)]
*  That's the one that vaccinologists are obsessed with, making sure there's enough antibody. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1461.8200000000002s)]
*  The vaccines that have aluminum in them, as opposed to the live attenuated vaccines, which [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1466.94s)]
*  don't have aluminum, all the other ones do. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1471.8200000000002s)]
*  Your DTAP is going to have aluminum in them. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1473.74s)]
*  All your killed vaccines are going to have aluminum in them. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1476.22s)]
*  That is very well known to trigger that TH2 response, which is the allergic response, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1479.26s)]
*  which can set up your body for autoimmunity. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1483.54s)]
*  Part of the purpose of breastfeeding, which is part of the blueprint for humanity and [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1488.74s)]
*  every other mammal, is that the mother is able to introduce antigens in the world to [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1494.1s)]
*  her baby through her own breast and things that she's been eating and breathing in. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1499.98s)]
*  Then the baby is able to develop tolerance. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1503.4199999999998s)]
*  While vaccine scientists are obsessed with getting antibodies and ramping up an infant's [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1506.1s)]
*  inadequate immune system, the fact of the matter is that it's more important to learn [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1510.6999999999998s)]
*  what not to react to when your immune system's developing, rather than to becoming defensive [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1514.9399999999998s)]
*  against every microbe that could get you. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1519.1399999999999s)]
*  That's the paradox there and one of the battlegrounds for immunology, within immunology, and for [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1522.02s)]
*  those of us out here that are going, what are you doing here? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1528.26s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1531.54s)]
*  You were also talking in your book about the importance of breast milk and the amount of [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1532.54s)]
*  nutrition that's in breast milk for a child and what it does for a child and the differences [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1538.2199999999998s)]
*  in their immune system, the differences in a lot of different aspects of their development, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1544.26s)]
*  which is pretty fascinating. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1549.98s)]
*  Most people kind of just assume it's food. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1551.6s)]
*  It's just food, but it's a lot more than that. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1554.3s)]
*  It's so much more than that. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1557.18s)]
*  I was actually quite startled when I really went down that rabbit hole to see not only, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1558.58s)]
*  it is food. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1564.86s)]
*  It's excellent nutrition with short chain fatty acids and sugars that the baby needs. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1565.98s)]
*  It actually trains your gut to be healthy in the long run as an adult, which trains [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1569.3799999999999s)]
*  your immune system as well. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1573.94s)]
*  But what that mother is putting through her breast milk, things like something called [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1575.6200000000001s)]
*  HAMLET, H-A-M-L-E-T, which stands for human alpha lactalbumin made lethal to tumors. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1579.38s)]
*  This is a substance, this is a protein, it's like a transformer protein that can literally [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1587.5400000000002s)]
*  turn into a cancer busting molecule that is being used by the oncology industry. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1593.8200000000002s)]
*  When it's not in that form, it's a powerful protein that fights off pertussis, all kinds [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1600.98s)]
*  of pneumococcal bacteria. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1607.28s)]
*  And when it's not doing that, it's food. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1609.78s)]
*  So it's like it's got so many different purposes. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1611.98s)]
*  Stem cells are coming through that mother's milk. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1614.98s)]
*  Activated T cells. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1618.1s)]
*  Activated T cells have another substance in them that is kind of hijacked by the oncology [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1619.74s)]
*  And that is when they're immunosuppressing kids for leukemia or whatever, and they come [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1625.94s)]
*  in contact, say, with chickenpox. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1631.38s)]
*  What they can do is get somebody like me, who's immune to chickenpox naturally, and [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1634.44s)]
*  take my memory T cells that remember that, and there's a substance in there called dialyzable [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1638.8200000000002s)]
*  leukocyte extract. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1645.42s)]
*  When you put that into another child, even if whether they eat it or inject it into them, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1647.44s)]
*  it transfers cellular, that TH1 important arm of immunity I just told you, it transfers [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1652.38s)]
*  it onto them and protects them for a long time. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1657.0200000000002s)]
*  So that's kind of in the old days when mothers had measles in the old days and normally, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1660.0600000000002s)]
*  and they were able to pass this powerful immunity through that DLE factor, as well as all these [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1665.9s)]
*  other things, including preformed immune globulins. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1671.22s)]
*  I mentioned something like 80,000 stem cells. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1674.8600000000001s)]
*  It's just incredible. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1678.5s)]
*  We still have only hit the tip of the iceberg in terms of what we know about breast milk. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1680.22s)]
*  But breast milk also, it's been proven again that if you are going to vaccinate your baby, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1685.72s)]
*  if you're breastfeeding, the vaccine will bring that baby more into a TH1. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1692.1599999999999s)]
*  If you're not breastfeeding and you're giving formula, that baby's going to move more into [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1695.94s)]
*  a TH2 in response to that vaccine. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1699.74s)]
*  So I think if most women understood the powers of breast milk, they would do everything possible [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1702.46s)]
*  to be able to do it. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1708.62s)]
*  I think you make a very compelling point for that. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1711.3799999999999s)]
*  I just think it's arrogant that we could assume that we could replace something with a bunch. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1713.8999999999999s)]
*  I mean, have you ever read the ingredients of formula? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1719.34s)]
*  How could that be good? [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1722.4599999999998s)]
*  I know. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1723.4599999999998s)]
*  The parasites, we have parasites that have been parasites upon humanity for such a long [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1724.4599999999998s)]
*  time and that's what happens is that something is discovered and for some people maybe it [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1729.82s)]
*  can be a good idea, but then the parasites take it and want to. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1735.1s)]
*  So when it came to breastfeeding, it was, you don't have to do that. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1738.3s)]
*  You don't have to bother yourself like that. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1741.34s)]
*  You don't have to pull your boobs out in public. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1742.9399999999998s)]
*  You don't have to become a dairy cow. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1744.9399999999998s)]
*  Just strap them down. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1747.02s)]
*  The milk will stop and then you can start putting this wonderful. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1748.02s)]
*  When I was a kid, I was fed soy milk in a warm plastic bag. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1750.5s)]
*  That was the fad then grown up. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1754.58s)]
*  So the formula industry is a huge moneymaker and some women do prefer it. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1757.54s)]
*  Unfortunately, 75% of women in the USA today do initiate breastfeeding. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1765.46s)]
*  That's very much better than the polio days when almost nobody was breastfeeding and they [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1769.54s)]
*  were using milk in the infant formula that had been contaminated by what the cows were [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1773.74s)]
*  eating. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1779.18s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1780.18s)]
*  And so that was another part of the polio story that's not been told. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1781.18s)]
*  So the cows were all eating these pesticides. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1784.8999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1787.5s)]
*  And herbicides. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1788.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1789.5s)]
*  And the cows were getting sick with it and then these people were drinking the milk from [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1790.5s)]
*  that cow and getting sick as well. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1794.5s)]
*  The cows wouldn't have been necessarily getting sick from it, but it would be concentrating [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1796.5s)]
*  in their milk. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1800.94s)]
*  And so the milk would have been expressed. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1801.94s)]
*  But you just brought me back to another place. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1805.38s)]
*  Cows were also used during the smallpox era and what you're saying is true about that. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1808.1s)]
*  So they would basically take what they thought was... [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1812.42s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1816.54s)]
*  It's just so dark that sometimes you have to laugh. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1817.94s)]
*  They would take pus from other animals, scratch it into the belly of a cow, then take the [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1821.1000000000001s)]
*  pus off of the big pimples that would form on the belly of a cow. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1825.06s)]
*  The cow could become very sick and yet that cow could still be butchered up at the butcher [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1830.78s)]
*  shop. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1834.5800000000002s)]
*  The butcher would get sick with pemphigus or some hand and mouth disease or the things [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1835.5800000000002s)]
*  that the cows normally catch. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1840.5800000000002s)]
*  And so those cows could still be used to produce meat in those cases. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1843.1000000000001s)]
*  I don't know that it was used to produce milk. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1846.78s)]
*  I don't think that would have... [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1848.7s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1850.18s)]
*  But I know it was used to produce meat because the butchers were getting sick and the people [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1851.3s)]
*  that were eating the meat were getting sick. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1854.18s)]
*  And certainly the people that took the vaccines that had certain who knows what in them because [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1857.14s)]
*  it was shown like into the 1970s, 80s and even recently, I have a reference from after [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1862.14s)]
*  the year 2000, that there was more bacteria and fungus in the smallpox vaccines than there [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1868.1000000000001s)]
*  was smallpox virus. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1873.3400000000001s)]
*  So it was because they had this thing called pure lymph, which was pus that came out of [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1875.16s)]
*  the horse's foot or a donkey's pus skin or a cadaver of a human or a cow's ulcerating [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1879.76s)]
*  udders and scraped into glycerin and called pure lymph and marketed all over the world. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1890.4s)]
*  This is the joke. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1895.8400000000001s)]
*  This was our success. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1897.0s)]
*  This is the one vaccine that eradicated a disease. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1898.52s)]
*  Can you believe that fairy tale? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1903.3400000000001s)]
*  I'll tell you another one. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1904.64s)]
*  It doesn't get crazy. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1906.4s)]
*  This is our success. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1907.4s)]
*  This vaccine that I had described in great detail with what was in it and what people [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1909.8600000000001s)]
*  saw under microscopes and then later tested genetically was what was called a quasi species, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1914.0800000000002s)]
*  meaning they don't even... [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1920.1200000000001s)]
*  After a while, it became its own thing. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1921.1200000000001s)]
*  It wasn't from a horse anymore. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1923.3400000000001s)]
*  It wasn't from a human anymore. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1925.1200000000001s)]
*  They called it humanized horsepox when they genetically characterized the dry vax and [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1926.9s)]
*  then ordered that every dry vax specimen on the planet be destroyed. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1933.76s)]
*  I think that was around 2009. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1937.84s)]
*  Why did they do that? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1941.04s)]
*  Good question. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1942.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1943.92s)]
*  Hiding the evidence, possibly, but they now have a new vaccine, which doesn't work. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1944.92s)]
*  But they wanted to bring this one back when I was in the peak of my career in 2003. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1950.84s)]
*  on my desk stating that they needed people to get vaccinated for smallpox so that those [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1957.72s)]
*  other people that were getting vaccinated would have somebody that could treat them [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1964.8s)]
*  that would be immune to smallpox because it's well known that if you get a smallpox vaccine [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1967.8999999999999s)]
*  and you get these horrible scabs that you're going to spread smallpox and you're going [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1972.36s)]
*  to have a horrible itchy time of secondary infections. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1977.68s)]
*  You will need a doctor at some point. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1980.56s)]
*  Well, it turns out that the trials that they did on super healthy people, soldiers that [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1982.72s)]
*  were in top shape, were so bad in terms of cardiac disease and other diseases that the [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1987.44s)]
*  government put it on hold for a second and said, oh, no, no, we can't do this. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1993.16s)]
*  Meanwhile, guess what? [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1996.72s)]
*  They were using the same vaccine in the 1700s and 1800s. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=1997.9s)]
*  Late 1700s, all through the 1800s into the 1900s. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2002.88s)]
*  They would sometimes, you probably saw the picture of the child's arm considered a good [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2008.32s)]
*  take five huge ulcers on the arm with sanitation being what it was. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2012.06s)]
*  No antibiotics. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2018.2s)]
*  Can you imagine having your baby have five scars on its arm ulcerating from these things, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2019.3799999999999s)]
*  having fevers? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2024.54s)]
*  Sometimes the arms became necrotic. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2025.94s)]
*  Sometimes the disease spread all over the place and there was nothing to give them except [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2027.98s)]
*  bloodletting, mercurials and arsenicals and heating them up in a dark room with no sunlight. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2031.82s)]
*  That was the treatment for smallpox. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2038.22s)]
*  So you tell me why smallpox was so lethal. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2039.62s)]

*  public health conditions during the time of the smallpox outbreak. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2119.98s)]

*  Yeah, drinking water was a pit. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2163.7799999999997s)]
*  You would skim the top off drinking water back then. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2165.62s)]
*  And we know that co-infections make make any primary infection worse. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2169.04s)]
*  You know, if you have measles and you get a co-infection, it makes it worse. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2172.66s)]
*  COVID with a co-infection. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2175.1s)]
*  Anything makes it worse. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2176.1s)]
*  You end up with, you know, pneumonias and pus pockets in your lungs. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2177.5s)]
*  So yeah, thank you for that description. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2181.26s)]
*  I don't think I could have done it much better myself. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2182.7s)]
*  But that's that's the that was normal. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2184.78s)]
*  Go watch Gangs of New York. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2186.86s)]
*  Like that's that's obviously a drama. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2188.58s)]
*  And you know, it's probably not completely accurate. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2192.38s)]
*  But I bet it's pretty close. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2194.3s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty close to how people live back then. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2195.54s)]
*  Yeah, the slums like you can you can actually like in here. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2197.62s)]
*  It's not all medical articles quoted. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2200.58s)]
*  Some of the quotes that we use are historical quotes from, you know, anthropologists that [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2203.66s)]
*  would go through the slums in New York. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2207.74s)]
*  You know, the Ellis Island was just bringing people in, bringing people in. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2209.42s)]
*  And these they would sometimes have 20 people in one room with no privy dark, you know, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2212.02s)]
*  like you say, some of the sewage would run underneath the house. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2218.46s)]
*  The smell of it would be coming up through the whole time. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2221.2999999999997s)]
*  And then you have them working 16 hours a day at the age of anything upwards of four [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2223.38s)]
*  to five years old could be sent to either coal mines or canneries to bring money in [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2228.7799999999997s)]
*  for the families to barely survive. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2234.18s)]
*  So people weren't being paid very well. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2235.8999999999996s)]
*  But you just said smallpox being what it was. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2238.06s)]
*  But what people don't realize is that in the 1600s, late 1680s, doctors were describing [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2240.7799999999997s)]
*  smallpox as one of the easiest diseases to treat if you simply just supported the human. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2246.02s)]
*  Again, quoted that. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2250.06s)]
*  And then what happened is the Industrial Revolution and people were taken with the Land Enclosure [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2252.62s)]
*  out from the farms and brought into cities, which didn't have the pigs basically were [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2257.1s)]
*  the garbage men back then. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2261.4199999999996s)]
*  So the pigs ran wild. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2262.9399999999996s)]
*  Thank God, because if they didn't, it would have been even worse. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2263.9399999999996s)]
*  Horses were your cars. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2266.62s)]
*  So your horse were dumping everywhere. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2267.62s)]
*  You know, some people just they said there was a foot of horse manure to get through [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2269.74s)]
*  to walk across the street. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2272.74s)]
*  So it was it was horrible and pretty much every way you can think of. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2274.8199999999997s)]
*  And then the human oppression on top of it in terms of the poverty that was there and [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2279.3399999999997s)]
*  the wealthy elite at the top kind of, you know, living the good life. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2283.7799999999997s)]
*  But it was starting to filter up to them at some point, which is why it was actually individual [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2287.1s)]
*  people that sponsored the first public drinking fountains and things like that. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2292.4199999999996s)]
*  It was probably partly to save themselves because if you can if you can stop disease [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2297.5s)]
*  from running rampant through society, look, they still had to go into the cities to get [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2303.02s)]
*  things. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2306.8599999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2307.8599999999997s)]
*  And even if you sent your servant into the city, a servant could bring you home something [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2308.8599999999997s)]
*  lovely from the city. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2311.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2313.86s)]
*  This is not the picture that was painted when we were children of what society was like. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2315.9s)]
*  You know, we were told that this vaccine was so important and it was so effective that [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2322.3s)]
*  we don't need it anymore. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2327.34s)]
*  I actually ended up with one when I was very young. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2328.46s)]
*  I think what we're talking about when we're saying the conditions that these conditions [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2330.58s)]
*  aren't known to most people and that these conditions coincide with these diseases. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2334.26s)]
*  And that's probably it's probably not just a correlation. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2339.2599999999998s)]
*  So the conditions correlate with the with the diseases and the conditions also correlate [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2344.02s)]
*  with the death rates. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2350.46s)]
*  OK. And so there were many of the diseases that we're talking say just diarrhea. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2352.02s)]
*  Do you know diarrhea killed more people in the Civil War than bullets? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2355.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And lots of other wars. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2359.8199999999997s)]
*  Diarrhea. Diarrhea can be caused by lots of things. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2361.14s)]
*  Nothing that we vaccinate for essentially. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2364.22s)]
*  Well, I mean, today there's rotavirus, but that wasn't a thing then. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2366.5s)]
*  It was more, you know, typhus and things like that. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2369.1s)]
*  So and cholera. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2372.18s)]
*  Are they getting it from water? [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2373.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's what that would have been, because they would be out, you know, in the in the [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2375.2999999999997s)]
*  bush or the trenches, you know, drinking what they could. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2378.54s)]
*  So redirect me again. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2380.9s)]
*  We're just talking about the OK. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2386.02s)]
*  So the the diseases that there were never any vaccines for, we see the death rate come [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2388.1s)]
*  down at the same exact avalanche as the diseases that we did vaccinate for. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2393.86s)]
*  And in some cases, there's a little blip when the vaccine comes up and things get worse [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2398.3s)]
*  for a bit and then come back down. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2401.78s)]
*  So, again, the point of the book was just interpreting the data that existed for a [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2404.02s)]
*  really long time. Vital statistics throughout the world as to the decline in death rate. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2409.26s)]
*  In some cases, disease rates went down, too. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2414.82s)]
*  But the most important thing was the death rate, because that's what people did. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2417.1s)]
*  Your baby could die. You have to have a vaccine, right? [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2419.86s)]
*  It's not your baby could have a rash. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2422.06s)]
*  You know, so different diseases have different severities and and different solutions and [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2424.86s)]
*  different ways to treat them so that they never have to present to a hospital. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2430.82s)]
*  But like you said, you know, back in those days, you know, there wasn't the pharmacies [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2434.7000000000003s)]
*  basically had your mercurials, arsenicals, if you were lucky, some homeopathics. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2439.58s)]
*  That was pretty much medicine back then until aspirin was invented, which was probably one [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2444.1800000000003s)]
*  of the reasons why the 1918 flu looked as bad as it did, because they were giving people [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2448.02s)]
*  up to 10 grams of aspirin a day, which can cause pulmonary edema in a healthy person. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2452.34s)]
*  So what was the logic behind the arsenics and the mercurials? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2457.66s)]
*  Like, how did that become an approach that they use for medicine? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2462.9s)]
*  Well, I don't know, actually. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2468.7s)]
*  Don't know the answer to why they started doing that. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2470.42s)]
*  Those are two really bad things. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2473.06s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you. I'll tell you how they prescribed it is they would say, give one [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2474.22s)]
*  grain until emesis occurs. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2478.06s)]
*  That means throwing up. So give it until a person throws up, because back then they [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2480.9s)]
*  believed that if they could get you to throw up, they thought bringing stuff out of [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2483.98s)]
*  your body was good. Bloodletting, throwing up and diarrhea. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2487.06s)]
*  And so that's how that was the threshold for giving a lot of these drugs. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2490.2999999999997s)]
*  So they thought instead, you know, how can you get someone to have diarrhea as a [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2493.94s)]
*  doctor? OK, well, we can give them mercurials and arsenicals. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2497.82s)]
*  That will do the trick. And so they thought that they could purge the body by doing [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2500.66s)]
*  that. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2505.58s)]
*  Medicine, past, present and future. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2505.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2509.34s)]
*  OK. Paradoxically, as a therapeutic agent that has been used since ancient times [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2510.46s)]
*  for the treatment of multiple diseases. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2514.9s)]
*  So does it actually cure some stuff? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2516.86s)]
*  Small doses? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2520.1000000000004s)]
*  Well, what does it cure if you have a dead patient or a patient with neuropathy? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2521.1400000000003s)]
*  You haven't really cured anyone, have you? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2525.9s)]
*  Right. Well, isn't it dose dependent? [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2527.5s)]
*  Right. It says arsenic trioxide, the active ingredient in the traditional Chinese [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2529.34s)]
*  medicine was shown to produce dramatic remission of acute pol- you could say that [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2533.3s)]
*  word, ma'am. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2538.1400000000003s)]
*  Pro myelocytic leukemia. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2539.0600000000004s)]
*  Thank you. Yeah. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2540.5800000000004s)]
*  Similar to the fact that they decided that vitamin A could do it. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2542.02s)]
*  OK. Right. Transretinoic acid. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2544.54s)]
*  So retinoic acid, which is vitamin A. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2547.54s)]
*  Yeah. OK. That's interesting. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2549.9s)]
*  Well, I would say vitamin A is probably less risky. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2551.94s)]
*  What's that? I'd say it's less risky for vitamin A than arsenic. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2554.86s)]
*  I mean, is it a different kind of arsenic? [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2558.42s)]
*  Slightly different kind of arsenic or a lower dose of arsenic? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2560.1800000000003s)]
*  Is that? They would they measured things in grains back then. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2563.34s)]
*  And so I guess that's probably like maybe like a milligram, something like that. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2567.38s)]
*  But the Chinese medicine is probably the root of it, right? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2571.6600000000003s)]
*  Why they thought it was medicine. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2573.5800000000004s)]
*  Could be. But maybe they use the wrong arsenic or. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2575.2200000000003s)]
*  I guess you start trying the things that you have, right? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2580.46s)]
*  Mercury is a crazy one, though. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2583.34s)]
*  Haven't they known that's poison forever? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2585.7000000000003s)]
*  Like, wasn't that quick silver, though? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2588.46s)]
*  These in the same thing or no? [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2591.34s)]
*  I don't know. It's a fascinating metal because it's a liquid. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2593.46s)]
*  It's a liquid metal. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2595.9s)]
*  A lot of people played with it when they were kids. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2596.7s)]
*  I know some of the smartest people I know talk about how they played [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2598.46s)]
*  with the mercury ball when they were little. Yikes. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2601.26s)]
*  And it's in thermometers. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2603.94s)]
*  And obviously it works quite well. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2605.1s)]
*  There's there's a use for mercury. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2606.62s)]
*  But the reason that that that it's put into the it was actually in the MMR [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2609.3s)]
*  vaccines and some of the flu vaccines is because it's an antimicrobial. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2615.58s)]
*  They'll kill everything. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2619.2999999999997s)]
*  So maybe that was part of that, because it will kill everything. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2620.38s)]
*  Will kill the microbes in a petri dish. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2623.2599999999998s)]
*  So in order to because this is one of the realities of vaccine manufacture, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2625.34s)]
*  which I want your audience to understand, is that vaccines, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2628.7s)]
*  while it might look like just a clear liquid in order to make a vaccine, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2632.74s)]
*  you have to have either a cow that you put ulcers on and scrape the pus off [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2636.5s)]
*  or you can evolve it as it had evolved to maybe getting, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2641.86s)]
*  you know, some tumorous cells that came out of a cocker spaniels kidney [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2647.2999999999997s)]
*  or monkey balls or or monkey kidneys. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2650.22s)]
*  And you plate those cells out and then you inoculate it [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2653.8199999999997s)]
*  with what you want to grow to put in your vaccine later. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2657.2599999999998s)]
*  But in order to keep those cells alive, you have to put animal blood on it. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2660.42s)]
*  You have to put different nutrients on top of it. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2664.22s)]
*  You have to put antibiotics, canamysin, you know, things like that [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2666.3399999999997s)]
*  related to the covid here, mercury. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2669.54s)]
*  OK, so in the end, you can kill. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2671.94s)]
*  You can make sure when you have your final product that if you put [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2673.66s)]
*  a little bit of mercury in there, that it's less likely for any of the fungus [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2676.26s)]
*  or the spores or the bacteria or the adventitious viruses [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2679.78s)]
*  that you didn't know about that were there before will be in your final product. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2683.0200000000004s)]
*  Wonderful. So you have a product now that you can be not completely sure [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2686.82s)]
*  has any of these [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2691.2200000000003s)]
*  deadly microbes, but now has mercury, which the only places [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2693.7400000000002s)]
*  it's actually OK to have on on the planet. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2697.6600000000003s)]
*  Mercury is in vaccines, your tooth [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2700.26s)]
*  or toxic landfill. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2704.98s)]
*  So if you were to drop a vaccine at a vaccine clinic onto the floor, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2706.3399999999997s)]
*  the hazmat guys would come in. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2710.7s)]
*  You're not allowed to just pick it up if it's got if it's a mercury [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2711.8599999999997s)]
*  containing vaccine, hazmat people have to come and take that away. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2714.74s)]
*  Yet we're OK to take, you know, set a portion of that vial and inject it [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2718.46s)]
*  into, you know, a child, a three month old child. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2721.74s)]
*  How does that work? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2725.3799999999997s)]
*  It doesn't sound logical. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2727.3799999999997s)]
*  And then old, actually, there was also the issue with the different types [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2729.1s)]
*  of mercury, right? [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2733.1s)]
*  There was is it methyl and ethyl? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2734.66s)]
*  Not too different. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2736.66s)]
*  Yeah, apparently, ethyl is good and methyl is bad, according to Paul Offit, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2737.9s)]
*  senior vaccine scientist. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2742.7799999999997s)]
*  But the fact of the matter is once once mercury is methylated [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2744.7799999999997s)]
*  and like fish, fish can methylate mercury and they can get rid of it. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2748.98s)]
*  Once we de-methylate mercury, it's it's in us until you do something [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2753.66s)]
*  like something called chelation, where you can put a chemical into the body [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2757.58s)]
*  that can grab onto it and pull it out through your urine. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2760.54s)]
*  Otherwise, you're stuck with it. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2763.74s)]
*  So in my opinion, all mercury is bad. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2765.7s)]
*  Shouldn't be put into humans, shouldn't be in our food sources, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2769.14s)]
*  shouldn't be in our environment, except for in the net. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2771.98s)]
*  And look, you can even find uranium in nature, right? [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2774.1s)]
*  It's what people do to it to concentrate it and how they use it. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2776.42s)]
*  That becomes a problem. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2779.14s)]
*  Wasn't the issue that one of them, I don't know, it's methyl or ethyl [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2780.98s)]
*  mercury leaves the body quicker. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2785.06s)]
*  Yes, it's ethyl mercury that leaves the body quicker because methyl is [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2787.74s)]
*  a it's a it's a chemical that gets put onto it naturally. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2790.8199999999997s)]
*  And apparently, I'm not an expert on mercury poisoning, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2795.14s)]
*  but apparently methyl mercury, we don't have the ability to excrete. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2798.62s)]
*  But ethyl mercury, we do. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2803.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2807.4599999999996s)]
*  But wasn't there also an issue that it crosses the blood brain barrier? [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2808.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, anytime there's inflammation, anything can cross the blood brain [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2812.4599999999996s)]
*  barrier. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2816.42s)]
*  With the it's the aluminum that we really know crosses the blood brain [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2817.2200000000003s)]
*  barrier. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2821.02s)]
*  And that's still in vaccines today. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2822.34s)]
*  And, yeah, anyway, we get into blood brain barrier if you want to. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2824.54s)]
*  That's a whole other story. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2828.62s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2830.86s)]
*  So mercury, obviously, it can get into the brain. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2831.62s)]
*  It's it's it's found in the brain. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2834.1800000000003s)]
*  It can get into your adrenals and your other glands and important [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2835.54s)]
*  areas of your body. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2839.1400000000003s)]
*  And even the thing is, even at such low levels can cause blood brain [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2840.34s)]
*  low levels can cause problems. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2845.06s)]
*  No neurotoxin. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2846.94s)]
*  There's no has no place for circulating or being deposited in the human [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2848.78s)]
*  body in any form. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2852.34s)]
*  But isn't it fascinating that they've done such a good job promoting this, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2853.94s)]
*  that people are going to get outraged at what you're saying. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2857.62s)]
*  They've done such a good job. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2860.98s)]
*  My life. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2862.06s)]
*  And you've got a lot of courage. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2864.06s)]
*  And I want to commend you for that, because writing that book and being [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2865.3s)]
*  here talking about it takes a lot of courage. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2868.2599999999998s)]
*  And it's from regular people who want to believe the vaccine. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2870.58s)]
*  They're scarier than anybody. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2874.66s)]
*  The people that are just rabid Vaxxers and they want they stand for science [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2876.42s)]
*  like they're the warriors for science and they get very aggressive about it. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2882.46s)]
*  And they don't even want to breach the subject. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2885.98s)]
*  They don't even want to look at it because the more you look at it, if you're [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2888.18s)]
*  a logical, rational person without like a deep seeded ideology attached to [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2892.2999999999997s)]
*  vaccines and you just look at the reality of it, you just go, what, what is this? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2896.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2902.7s)]
*  How did you trick people into injecting? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2902.98s)]
*  How many a year now for kids? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2906.94s)]
*  What is it? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2908.62s)]
*  In the seventies. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2909.42s)]
*  We're in the seven. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2910.14s)]
*  I believe we're in the seventies. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2910.62s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2911.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2912.66s)]
*  That's, and then you want to demonize anybody who says anything about vaccine [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2913.34s)]
*  side effects, you are the craziest of kooks. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2919.14s)]
*  They come down, you with the hardest publicity campaign. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2922.22s)]
*  It's so transparent. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2925.22s)]
*  You see it coming a mile away and you're still shocked by how blatant it is. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2928.06s)]
*  And no one wants to look at the actual issue itself. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2933.26s)]
*  And no one wants to say like, well, is she right? [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2936.98s)]
*  If you read your book, is she right? [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2940.22s)]
*  If you're right. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2943.22s)]
*  And I think you're right. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2943.98s)]
*  Like we've been lied to and we've been tricked into thinking that this is all [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2945.02s)]
*  settled science and that's what's infuriating. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2950.42s)]
*  It's not that it's anti-science. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2954.1s)]
*  It's like, this is not science. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2956.46s)]
*  What you guys are doing is not science. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2958.42s)]
*  You've subverted, you've, you've perverted that notion and you've, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2960.46s)]
*  you've done it in an amazing way. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2965.78s)]
*  I mean, hats off to you. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2967.5s)]
*  What they've done in terms of like brainwashing people to believe that all [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2968.54s)]
*  this is it's not just necessary, but it saves millions of lives and anybody that [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2971.86s)]
*  is against it in any way, shape or form is a quack and you should be deplatformed [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2977.1s)]
*  and never talked about again and polite public society and cocktail parties. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2980.78s)]
*  You'll be shunned. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2985.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2986.82s)]
*  Well, the way they were able to get away with it is 226 years worth of propaganda. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2987.7000000000003s)]
*  Cause the fact of the matter is that ever since the beginning of the smallpox [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2992.62s)]
*  vaccines, there have been vaccine deaths. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2996.1400000000003s)]
*  The reason, and look, we've added, I brought you a special copy. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=2999.1800000000003s)]
*  This is a limited edition. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3002.86s)]
*  In the 10th anniversary edition, we added 200 pages and we added a [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3004.34s)]
*  chapter called the white plague. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3007.82s)]
*  The white plague is also tuberculosis. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3009.58s)]
*  Tuberculosis was a side effect of the, um, of smallpox vaccine. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3011.42s)]
*  Uh, tuberculosis rates were rampant and in fact, the, the inventor of the [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3016.62s)]
*  smallpox vaccine, um, his child died of tuberculosis and so did his two [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3021.3s)]
*  test subjects that he used. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3026.2200000000003s)]
*  And it was a well known to follow smallpox. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3028.54s)]
*  Lots of doctors talked about it, but, um, in, in about two or three years after [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3030.62s)]
*  the vaccine was accepted in England, uh, you hear doctors speaking out about it, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3035.46s)]
*  cursing the day they ever agreed to do it to people, to children, to anybody. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3042.3s)]
*  And so what happened is that the government came down harder and started [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3045.9s)]
*  making it mandatory and would take your furniture away and started intimidating [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3049.02s)]
*  the doctors and that's an age old thing as well. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3053.3s)]
*  And I experienced it in any doctor that's ever stepped out of line and said something [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3055.62s)]
*  bad about vaccines will either be intimidated or worse. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3060.46s)]
*  So 220 years of, 226 years of propaganda. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3064.42s)]
*  And, and so I'm just going to give you one example and I'll, and I'll give you a [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3068.98s)]
*  copy of this to have, and you can put it up later if you want, but in 1984, because [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3072.62s)]
*  there was so much, so much going on in terms of the public learning about the [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3076.62s)]
*  problems with the diphtheria tetanus pertussis vaccine and the polio vaccines [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3080.7s)]
*  that a federal register was issued by the government and went to all health [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3084.66s)]
*  departments in the United States, which is supposed to have just kept there and [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3088.54s)]
*  never circulated. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3091.7s)]
*  And it said, quote, any doubts, whether or not well-founded about the safety of [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3092.9399999999996s)]
*  the vaccination program must not be allowed to exist. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3099.2999999999997s)]
*  That's literally what it said. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3103.66s)]
*  It's straight out of, you know, George Orwell. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3105.2999999999997s)]
*  So you had that, then you have the changing of the goalposts and the [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3109.66s)]
*  outright lies within scientism, because it's not science. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3113.74s)]
*  It's the religion that that's calls itself science. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3116.5s)]
*  And we still are a victim of that today. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3119.18s)]
*  Most science today is sponsored by the very people that are going to profit from [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3122.58s)]
*  it. And I think even look, even Jenner, who invented the smallpox vaccine, never [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3126.54s)]
*  did a scientific study. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3132.46s)]
*  He never did a controlled study. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3133.7799999999997s)]
*  He never did non-vaccinated people, vaccinated people, and then expose them to [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3135.3399999999997s)]
*  smallpox in a large enough group. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3139.62s)]
*  He would cowpox them and then expose them to smallpox. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3141.8999999999996s)]
*  And it was well known that smallpox followed cowpox. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3145.22s)]
*  So it's just been a look again. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3148.34s)]
*  I never expected to be here. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3152.6600000000003s)]
*  I just wanted to be a healer. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3154.0600000000004s)]
*  I just wanted to be a doctor. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3155.2200000000003s)]
*  I wanted to be a nephrologist and teach medical students and make the world a [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3156.5s)]
*  better place for people. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3159.5s)]
*  That's all I ever wanted. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3160.6200000000003s)]
*  This is a nightmare for me, actually, to well, while I've met some incredible [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3162.02s)]
*  people and I've had a really good life and I have no regrets and I would do it [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3166.34s)]
*  all again. No doctor wants to be put in a position where their integrity is [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3169.9s)]
*  doubted, their sanity is doubted. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3174.42s)]
*  And if you want to pull up a page called, it is called Rational Wiki, I think [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3177.54s)]
*  maybe. Anyway, I'm considered a Sith Lord. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3185.46s)]
*  A very, and in fact, I didn't know what a Sith Lord was back then. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3191.06s)]
*  I had to actually look it up. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3194.58s)]
*  So I'm like Darth Vader. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3195.54s)]
*  So a bit, it was a bit of a compliment. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3196.66s)]
*  But on the other hand, most doctors can't tolerate being called quacks or having [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3198.34s)]
*  their reputation destroyed. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3202.58s)]
*  And, you know, I went from treating the CEO of actually the head of the [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3203.7799999999997s)]
*  laboratory at my hospital for hypertension to becoming, you know, somebody [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3209.14s)]
*  that was doubted on every levels after a while because of one thing that I said, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3213.58s)]
*  which was, can we stop giving vaccines to my sick patients, to people who are [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3217.98s)]
*  having chemotherapy while they're having chemotherapy, to my patient before I've [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3222.58s)]
*  even seen them on the ward? [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3226.74s)]
*  Can we just, can we just hold this up and give it to them on the day of discharge? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3227.86s)]
*  That was my request in the beginning. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3231.18s)]
*  That's how this all landed here. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3232.8599999999997s)]
*  And had they not tried to intimidate me, doubt me and pushed me to research and [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3234.5s)]
*  show that what I saw was actually real, I would still be lockstep working as a [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3239.54s)]
*  regular doctor because there were some good things about it. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3243.3799999999997s)]
*  So the look, even if you look at what happened with COVID, let's just look at [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3246.3399999999997s)]
*  that. Like, how did how did they pass this off? [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3251.14s)]
*  Look at the media today. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3253.94s)]
*  Do you know that they're giving COVID vaccines to six month old children now? [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3255.06s)]
*  We know how bad it is. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3259.22s)]
*  We know that it ruins stem cells in pregnant women. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3260.3s)]
*  They don't give stem cells to their babies. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3262.46s)]
*  The industry is upset because the placentas no longer have stem cells. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3264.1800000000003s)]
*  They used to use those stem cells in research and cosmetics, et cetera. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3267.9s)]
*  They're not getting them anymore because what the COVID shots did to the placentas [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3271.98s)]
*  and those infants, that's not being talked about in the media. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3275.42s)]
*  Nothing bad about the shots being talked about when we have Kevin McKernan and all [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3278.5s)]
*  these people looking at it going, there's SV 40 in it. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3282.26s)]
*  There was a Staphylococcal endotoxin gene. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3284.7400000000002s)]
*  There were two snake genes in there. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3286.86s)]
*  You know, it's a definite gain of function. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3288.7s)]
*  Nope. We got to put it on the vaccine, the baby vaccine schedule, because any doubts, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3290.22s)]
*  whether or not well funded about the vaccination must not be allowed to exist. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3294.46s)]
*  That's why that sounds like a religion and it sounds like a cult. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3298.54s)]
*  It sounds like a crazy cult that the whole world's been sucked into. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3302.62s)]
*  Giving a COVID shot to a baby today is insane. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3306.46s)]
*  Three of them. They get three by the certain. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3310.02s)]
*  I know you'd have to look up the schedule, but I believe it starts at six months and [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3313.46s)]
*  they get three of them kind of boom, boom, boom. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3316.62s)]
*  Are doctors really recommending this? [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3318.3399999999997s)]
*  It's it's on the it. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3320.38s)]
*  Look, there's there's a group of people called ACIP, the doctors, usually with [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3323.14s)]
*  vaccine interests in their bank accounts that make the recommendations for the [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3328.22s)]
*  vaccines. And they have recommended that that six month old. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3331.7799999999997s)]
*  So if your doctor is following the ACIP program, you have to be offered that [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3335.5s)]
*  vaccine. And now that doctor, this is another part of the story, is that doctor's [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3339.38s)]
*  likely to lose two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year if they don't do [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3343.26s)]
*  that, because there's incentive given to hospitals and doctors, which is what [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3346.38s)]
*  naively I was on the other end of when I woke up in 2008 and said, wait a minute, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3351.7400000000002s)]
*  why are we doing this stuff to my sick, inflamed patients? [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3355.9s)]
*  You're giving more inflammation. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3358.5s)]
*  It's because the hospital would lose something like forty thousand dollars if [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3360.82s)]
*  they didn't give a vaccine within the first twenty four hours of admission. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3363.94s)]
*  Oh, my God. And they would get forty thousand. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3368.0200000000004s)]
*  It was all a money game. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3371.5s)]
*  That's really the bottom line of it. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3373.2200000000003s)]
*  And I didn't know that until a nurse years ago who was a high level [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3374.6600000000003s)]
*  administration. She said, Suzanne, this is why they do. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3379.02s)]
*  They did that to you. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3382.1s)]
*  Well, OK. Well, at least it makes sense now. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3383.86s)]
*  Nobody wants to think of it as a business. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3386.34s)]
*  Nobody wants to think you're making business decisions at the expense of [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3388.46s)]
*  someone's health and possibly whether or not they make it. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3391.7400000000002s)]
*  Like, what do you what are you doing? [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3395.78s)]
*  Well, that's been the case since, you know, basically the [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3397.5s)]
*  the medical profession was infiltrated in the early nineteen hundreds by, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3401.54s)]
*  you know, high level interests that that didn't want us thinking for ourselves [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3405.7s)]
*  and carrying on with the natural cures that actually work, carrying on with [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3409.7s)]
*  normal midwifery. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3413.02s)]
*  There was just so many changes that happened as a result of best practice [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3414.74s)]
*  medicine, not to mention, you know, the forming of the AMA by a couple of real [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3418.14s)]
*  quacks. That's a really good story. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3421.7799999999997s)]
*  And the AMA would give their stamp of approval. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3424.9s)]
*  So say you created an infant formula, well, it would say AMA approved [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3427.94s)]
*  and your infant formula would sell even better. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3431.8199999999997s)]
*  Remember when doctors smoked camels because camels were bad. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3433.9s)]
*  Those days. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3438.42s)]
*  And this is also the time when this coincides with when [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3439.5s)]
*  Rockefeller was designing the school system, right? [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3443.62s)]
*  Well, first, Rockefeller, I think oil was one of their primary. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3448.2999999999997s)]
*  So that's the pharmaceutical aspect. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3451.7799999999997s)]
*  That's right. Yeah. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3453.9s)]
*  Oh, so you want to talk about school? [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3455.02s)]
*  No, but he did both, right? [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3456.26s)]
*  He was a part of both. So he was a part of the he the reason why [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3457.7000000000003s)]
*  natural cures are so easily dismissed and why so dismissed [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3461.34s)]
*  because Rockefeller put the entire medical establishment on oil based. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3464.82s)]
*  That's right. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3469.1400000000003s)]
*  So all pharmaceutical drugs that are made by using oil. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3470.1s)]
*  Yeah. And he did it because he sold oil. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3473.38s)]
*  You know, that one of the ironies, it kind of works. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3476.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Like I got I got rid of a really bad case of manganese [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3478.6200000000003s)]
*  in a dog by kerosene, putting kerosene diluted in olive oil. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3481.82s)]
*  And they had been through everything. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3485.98s)]
*  They could not get rid of this mange on this beautiful dog. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3487.34s)]
*  Oh, wow. That's crazy. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3489.42s)]
*  Corso dog. And yeah. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3491.2200000000003s)]
*  So mange is horrible for dogs. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3493.34s)]
*  Oh, really bad. But one spray was done. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3495.5s)]
*  I had a dog that I picked up. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3498.2200000000003s)]
*  Keep careful around the flames and stuff. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3499.3s)]
*  I had a dog that I picked up off the street and took her in. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3502.54s)]
*  And she had horrible mange. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3505.94s)]
*  But it all went away with just food. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3507.26s)]
*  I just gave her healthy food. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3509.7000000000003s)]
*  No, it can't. Joe, come on. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3510.7s)]
*  You had to have an expert help you. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3512.18s)]
*  No kerosene. No nothing. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3513.46s)]
*  Just love food. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3515.5s)]
*  Oh, that was an argument I had in a hallway once with the senior [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3517.2599999999998s)]
*  chief of medicine. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3521.02s)]
*  He was he was like he would always say, so how are you today? [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3522.18s)]
*  Normally be like, good. You know, superficial. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3525.1s)]
*  I said, by the way, I'm having real trouble with, you know, the H1N1 vaccine. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3526.8599999999997s)]
*  My patient's getting kidney failure after getting it. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3531.2999999999997s)]
*  And he turned dark on me. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3534.5s)]
*  I never saw him dark before. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3536.06s)]
*  And he said, no, they just didn't have time to take effect. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3537.9s)]
*  And of course, then I heard every kind of sound bite in the book from him, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3541.1s)]
*  which I didn't know were sound bites at the time. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3543.82s)]
*  And then he said, well, what do you think has happened with meningitis? [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3545.78s)]
*  And these these college kids, I'm like, oh, come on, that's a total no brainer. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3548.14s)]
*  It's like their nutrition goes down the tubes when they leave home. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3551.14s)]
*  They're smoking. They're staying up all night long. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3554.1s)]
*  They're hanging out with their pals. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3555.94s)]
*  They're doing everything they couldn't do when they were at home. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3557.54s)]
*  Oh, you got to be kidding me. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3559.62s)]
*  So you think it's their food that's causing problems? [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3560.94s)]
*  And I was like, well, what medical school did you go to? [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3563.7000000000003s)]
*  I was actually taught that nutrition matters and how it matters and why it matters. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3566.2599999999998s)]
*  But that's been almost completely like if you're if you want to sneak [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3570.2999999999997s)]
*  the vitamin C into somebody's hospital room, you know the best way to do it. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3574.02s)]
*  Don't bring in our vitamin C because they will stop that at the door. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3577.2999999999997s)]
*  You get yourself a McDonald's milkshake or a burger, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3580.62s)]
*  and you just dump that milkshake out and you put something else in there, [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3584.22s)]
*  a smoothie with some vitamin C, and they will say, off you go. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3587.7s)]
*  That's perfectly fine. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3590.14s)]
*  That's going to be great for this person, this child. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3591.1s)]
*  That's how you can get it in, because they think that McDonald's is wonderful. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3593.3799999999997s)]
*  In fact, McDonald's are kind of situated proximal to a lot of hospitals [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3596.62s)]
*  and the McDonald's Ronald McDonald houses are there and everything else. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3600.18s)]
*  But bring in a homeopathic or, you know, magnesium or vitamin C, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3603.7s)]
*  and you've got to get permission for it and go through so much red tape. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3608.46s)]
*  And a lot of time you'll be told, no, you can't give it because, [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3611.06s)]
*  oh, you'll cause bowel necrosis, you'll cause diarrhea, you'll cause kidney stones, [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3614.22s)]
*  everything in the book that doesn't actually happen with vitamin C. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3618.1s)]
*  But it's what most look, they've measured vitamin C levels on people that enter [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3622.02s)]
*  hospitals, and pretty much everybody is deficient or on the border of deficient [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3626.94s)]
*  when they enter and pretty much everybody when they leave is got borderline scurvy. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3631.2599999999998s)]
*  If not full, full scurvy. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3636.74s)]
*  Fortunately, they go home and start doing other things [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3638.94s)]
*  and can rebuild some of their vitamin C scores. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3640.94s)]
*  But there is there is a lot of subclinical scurvy walking around out there. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3643.2999999999997s)]
*  And those are the people that are going to do the worst with the vaccine [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3647.1s)]
*  and then the worst they're going to do the worst with some clinical scurvy [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3649.74s)]
*  in modern society, just from poor diet. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3653.74s)]
*  Well, you know, it's not just the poor diet. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3656.58s)]
*  So any kind of stress will consume vitamin C. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3658.2599999999998s)]
*  A cigarette will consume 75 milligrams of vitamin C. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3662.8999999999996s)]
*  And they tell you that you only need 190 milligrams a day. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3665.9399999999996s)]
*  That's the FDA requirement. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3668.66s)]
*  So you just have a few cigarettes and you've depleted your stores. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3670.66s)]
*  So we don't make our own vitamin C as humans, humans and guinea pigs. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3673.9399999999996s)]
*  You know, that's we don't we don't do that. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3678.86s)]
*  And so we have to consume it. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3680.86s)]
*  And we're reliant upon our fruits and vegetables or supplements to do. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3683.2200000000003s)]
*  Or if you eat organ meat, you can eat the adrenals are loaded with it. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3686.6200000000003s)]
*  But aside from that, it's your fruits and vegetables that are going to give it to you. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3689.2200000000003s)]
*  So if you're under a lot of stress or you're taking medication [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3693.98s)]
*  or you have a lot of inflammation or arthritis, whatever, that's going to consume vitamin C [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3697.1400000000003s)]
*  because vitamin C is an antioxidant as well as an antiviral and, [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3701.26s)]
*  you know, good for your nervous system. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3704.6200000000003s)]
*  So, yeah, most people are walking around skimming the edge. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3708.1s)]
*  If you have you can see kind of a red line on some people's gums. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3712.18s)]
*  They're probably vitamin C deficient. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3715.2599999999998s)]
*  If your gums are bleeding a lot when you floss, you probably need some vitamin C. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3716.82s)]
*  And, you know, you could have an infection, too, but it will deal to the infection, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3721.18s)]
*  as well as the integrity and the collagen inside of your bones and your soft tissues. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3724.58s)]
*  I mean, it's it's like one of those things that's so important. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3728.2999999999997s)]
*  It should be given upon admission to every hospital. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3730.82s)]
*  And what's really crazy is if you're one of those people that thinks that all you need is a balanced diet [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3733.1s)]
*  and you're eating like a piece of chicken and some lettuce. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3737.58s)]
*  Yeah. Like that. There's no vitamin C in any of that. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3740.82s)]
*  Or not enough. Probably not enough. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3743.38s)]
*  Yeah, not enough. Won't do it. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3745.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. If you're if you're not consuming like some sort of liposomal vitamin C supplement, [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3747.26s)]
*  if you're not taking something on top of that, you're probably not at an optimal level to survive anything, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3753.54s)]
*  which is it's also it's like part of why we have so many metabolic diseases. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3759.02s)]
*  We have bad metabolic health. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3763.1000000000004s)]
*  We have metabolic diseases like they should. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3765.3s)]
*  It should be super obvious like, oh, everyone's like really unhealthy and doesn't have any nutrients in their system. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3767.62s)]
*  And they're all getting really sick from all these different things. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3773.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Huh. Yeah. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3776.26s)]
*  But everyone's like, no, you need medicine. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3777.82s)]
*  You need a shot. You need a this. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3780.9s)]
*  You need that. You need to get on this. You need to get off that and get back on this. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3782.58s)]
*  And you're a hippie. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3787.86s)]
*  If you want to just eat kiwi fruits and get your vitamin C from that or have oranges or broccoli. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3788.9s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. Broccoli makes you a total hippie or kale. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3793.74s)]
*  You get about it. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3796.7799999999997s)]
*  That's that. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3798.8199999999997s)]
*  No. See, we have a different kind of malnutrition today than than we describe in the book. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3800.14s)]
*  Back then, it was people were toxic from basically drinking poop water and being being worked to death [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3804.02s)]
*  and having diseases all around them. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3810.58s)]
*  And so they were protein calorie malnutrition as well as vitamin as well. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3813.66s)]
*  Today, we have kind of disnutrition, you know, like D.Y.S. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3819.38s)]
*  Disnutrition and that everyone's fat. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3823.62s)]
*  So they don't really look malnourished pretty much. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3825.78s)]
*  You know, you you go on a cruise or you go to the beach. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3828.5s)]
*  You even go to Berk Kreischer's house. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3831.14s)]
*  Bellies now. Big belly is the thing. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3832.7000000000003s)]
*  What was that? I said, go to Berk Kreischer's house. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3834.58s)]
*  Who is that? My friend. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3836.78s)]
*  He's going to hate that you don't know who he is. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3838.98s)]
*  But, you know, so today we've got inflamed guts from glyphosate [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3842.34s)]
*  and the wheat that's been altered to make us inflamed and then just the chemicals that are added to our food [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3846.22s)]
*  and the vitamins that actually don't help us and set us back that are fortifying our bread and milk [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3852.74s)]
*  lack of vitamin D. So we have a different kind of a problem, but essentially causing the same bodily dysfunction. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3858.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. The wheat thing I used to think was nonsense until I ate pasta and bread in Italy. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3865.18s)]
*  And I was like, OK, why do I feel so much better? [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3871.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Why do I not feel like I just ate poison? [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3874.2999999999997s)]
*  Because I love like pizza. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3876.46s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I love it. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3878.74s)]
*  I love lasagna. Oh, I love it. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3880.3399999999997s)]
*  I love it. It's so good. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3883.54s)]
*  But after it's over, I'm like I'm incapacitated for like an hour or two for like a two hour period. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3885.02s)]
*  You just like a shadow of yourself just. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3893.38s)]
*  Yeah. You think, oh, maybe it's just the high carbs, but you just proved that it wasn't because in Italy you were OK with it. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3896.74s)]
*  I ate a whole pizza in Italy and I was waiting for it. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3902.66s)]
*  I was like, I'm going to eat this margarita pizza. It's so good. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3904.98s)]
*  I did too. They made it in a brick oven. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3907.38s)]
*  I was like, this is so good. I'm eating the whole pizza. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3909.22s)]
*  I don't care. I don't care what it's going to feel like afterwards. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3911.3s)]
*  I ate that whole pizza and then I was like, where is it? [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3913.58s)]
*  Is it coming? And waiting for the hit. Never came. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3916.54s)]
*  Never came. I felt normal. I felt like I just ate food. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3919.06s)]
*  I was like, this is nuts. Like no crash. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3922.1s)]
*  Yeah. The bread in Scandinavia is the same. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3924.62s)]
*  That's what people used to eat. People don't know that. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3927.2599999999998s)]
*  What's that? I said that's what people used to eat. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3929.94s)]
*  It is. Like real food. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3931.3s)]
*  The people need to understand. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3932.5800000000004s)]
*  What they did was, and this is according to Maynard from Tool. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3934.1000000000004s)]
*  Do you know Maynard Keenan, the lead singer of Tool? [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3939.02s)]
*  No. He actually runs a farm. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3941.2200000000003s)]
*  He has vineyards and he has like, like he's Caduceus is his wine label. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3944.2200000000003s)]
*  And he's like really good at growing things because he has a restaurant. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3950.3s)]
*  He was explaining to me that what they did is they just engineered it to have higher yield. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3953.46s)]
*  So they put more. It's got more complex gluten in it. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3957.7400000000002s)]
*  So it's not the normal organic wheat that grows in Italy where they don't have genetically modified crops. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3960.66s)]
*  Right. So you still get that flour and you can still get that pasta from Italy and it's much more consumable. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3966.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. But the American stuff is just thick. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3973.1s)]
*  It's just your body's like, what is this? It just comes in like sludge. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3976.5s)]
*  It is interesting. It feels like I hate glue. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3981.06s)]
*  That's what it always feels like. Yeah. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3982.8599999999997s)]
*  When it's over. Unless it's really good sourdough bread. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3984.14s)]
*  That doesn't seem to have that. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3986.8999999999996s)]
*  Like I'm not gluten sensitive, but I definitely feel more awake when I don't have it. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3989.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's not good on holiday. But it's so delicious. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3993.58s)]
*  You know, I know. It's so delicious. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3996.66s)]
*  But this is also a problem. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=3998.86s)]
*  And this goes back to when R.J. Reynolds was going through all their stuff with the lawsuits that were coming from people [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4000.54s)]
*  realizing, oh, my God, cigarettes give you cancer. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4007.54s)]
*  They're not good to like smoke if you have emphysema. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4009.46s)]
*  I thought they were good for you. Add some arsenic and it'd be great. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4011.94s)]
*  There was a movie and I forget what movie it was. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4014.78s)]
*  And it was thank you for smoking. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4017.74s)]
*  Well, there's that. There was a movie where Leonardo DiCaprio was young and he was sick. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4020.54s)]
*  And his doctor was prescribing cigarettes to him. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4027.58s)]
*  And like the mother was saying, did you smoke your cigarettes? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4030.8199999999997s)]
*  The doctor told you to. You're not smoking. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4033.3399999999997s)]
*  Like you need to keep up your health. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4036.54s)]
*  Well, you know, there's something to that because you know about the nicotinic receptors and you know, the smokers got less covid than the rest of us. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4038.8599999999997s)]
*  And I did hear about that. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4044.62s)]
*  Well, also, doesn't nicotine kill covid? [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4047.14s)]
*  Like people were saying that nicotine. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4049.5s)]
*  No. So that's what it is. That's how it kills it. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4051.74s)]
*  Well, what happens? So the spike of covid is the evil part of covid has all these horrible lab engineered proteins encoded into them. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4053.42s)]
*  And two of them are snake toxin proteins that bind onto your nicotinic receptors. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4063.86s)]
*  OK. So if you can smoke nicotine or take nicotine gum, [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4069.02s)]
*  then you're going to block those receptors up so that so you can trade off some of the stuff that's from the spot. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4073.18s)]
*  What about like nicotine pouches? [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4078.74s)]
*  Yes, like that would probably if you're having, you know, long covid or, you know, any kind of post covid syndrome that's related to the nicotinic receptors, you only know by trying it. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4080.3399999999997s)]
*  But listen, I always say start small. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4090.5s)]
*  Don't go out and be a hero and, you know, take a whole dose at once. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4092.54s)]
*  Start with a quarter of whatever it says and wait and see what happens. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4095.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, because nicotine is a powerful drug. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4099.46s)]
*  Try cigar. Pick up the cigar. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4101.74s)]
*  Yeah, there you go. It's a wonderful habit. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4104.34s)]
*  Yeah, that was an uncomfortable thing in the beginning of covid. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4106.74s)]
*  They were saying that for some reason smokers seem to be having a much easier go of it. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4110.099999999999s)]
*  Like, what? I have a respiratory disease where smokers are, statistically speaking, getting less covid. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4114.66s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean, I've been around. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4123.139999999999s)]
*  I did a tour one time and there were two heavy, heavy smokers on the bus with me. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4124.54s)]
*  And they were the only two people that didn't come down with whatever flu with all the rest of us got. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4128.9s)]
*  Not even that flu couldn't even live in their throats. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4133.62s)]
*  It kind of makes sense if you think about it. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4137.86s)]
*  Well, it changes the polarity of your mucous membranes, the charge of the cells on your mucous membranes. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4140.7s)]
*  And that's probably part of why even the viruses can't adhere properly. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4145.379999999999s)]
*  We're not encouraging cigarettes. No, we're not at all. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4149.219999999999s)]
*  But we are saying it's got some benefits. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4151.299999999999s)]
*  But if you are, it should be non cured, naturally cured. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4152.219999999999s)]
*  Oh, like American spirits? Yes. Like those kind of deals. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4155.58s)]
*  I get all my smoking friends to convert to that brand. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4158.1s)]
*  Does that help? Totally. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4160.780000000001s)]
*  Oh, come on. Are you kidding me? You know how many horrible carcinogens there are. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4162.580000000001s)]
*  Do you know back in the native days when they were smoking and people were smoking natural cigarettes, [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4165.620000000001s)]
*  it was almost unheard of for them to develop lung cancer with a natural tobacco? [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4169.700000000001s)]
*  American spirit cigarettes are not healthier. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4174.900000000001s)]
*  They're absolutely wrong. But it is. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4177.38s)]
*  It's marketed as natural and additive free, which may lead people to believe that they are a safer option. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4179.14s)]
*  However, there's no scientific evidence to support this claim. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4183.46s)]
*  They may even have higher levels of nicotine than some other brands. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4186.98s)]
*  But the nicotine is not the problem. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4190.179999999999s)]
*  So that's exactly right. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4191.58s)]
*  Just by them saying that there, that leads me to think that this might be propaganda, [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4192.62s)]
*  because saying that nicotine is not the problem that that's our source or rather saying that they have. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4197.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, this is the AI overview. OK. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4202.5s)]
*  Oh, I'm just. But I understand. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4204.299999999999s)]
*  But AI should understand that. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4206.419999999999s)]
*  As Tony Hitschgliff. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4208.0599999999995s)]

*  I'm just saying AI doesn't make sense. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4212.419999999999s)]
*  What doesn't make sense is that it's saying they might have more nicotine, but that doesn't matter. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4215.06s)]
*  They're not addressing the actual question. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4218.740000000001s)]
*  I'm just using that to skip time, to save time, so we don't have to go through the whole thing. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4219.740000000001s)]

*  Like what they're writing seems to kind of be silly. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4224.660000000001s)]
*  Marketing of American spirits as natural can create a false sense of healthiness, [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4228.42s)]
*  which may make it more difficult for people to quit smoking. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4233.06s)]
*  I think smoking companies wrote this. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4235.46s)]
*  I think the other companies fed this information. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4237.5s)]
*  I think the bar row people wrote that. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4240.74s)]
*  The people spitting up blood on the packages and stuff. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4242.74s)]
*  Do you see them? Oh, in England, you get those? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4244.58s)]
*  No, they have it now. Oh, they have it in America here? [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4246.18s)]
*  They used to have it in America. I've been living overseas since. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4248.18s)]
*  In England, you go to England and they have photos of people with like rotten faces. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4250.18s)]
*  That's right. That's where I first saw it. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4252.18s)]
*  But it's moved to the rest of the... I know it's hilarious. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4253.9400000000005s)]
*  It's like, and they still buy them and smoke them. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4257.06s)]
*  Well, the interesting thing is, and I'm glad you brought this up, is just cancer in general. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4258.9400000000005s)]
*  Like, there's things that cause cancer that... [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4265.0599999999995s)]
*  They're just everywhere. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4271.219999999999s)]
*  And there's a lot of things in the environment that can cause cancer. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4272.259999999999s)]
*  But sometimes things get into medications that can cause cancer. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4276.98s)]
*  And what is SV40? [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4280.9s)]
*  I just wrote down SV40 while you were talking. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4285.219999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4287.299999999999s)]
*  And I'm just going to give you an example of what you're saying is correct. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4288.0199999999995s)]
*  The fact of the matter is that all cancers in humanity have gone up since the inception of [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4291.54s)]
*  vaccination. And my opinion, my educated opinion is that our lifespan should be 120 years. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4295.54s)]
*  And I think with the knowledge that we have and the wealth that we have on this planet, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4301.3s)]
*  ingenuity we have on this planet, we should be able to be touching the 120-year mark [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4305.22s)]
*  more commonly than we do. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4309.62s)]
*  So when vaccines started coming into humanity, we started introducing [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4311.860000000001s)]
*  animal disease into humanity through the skin. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4316.740000000001s)]
*  And then we started doing intermuscular injections after the hypodermic needle was created. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4319.46s)]
*  And then you started having deeper injections of animal disease and of chemicals and [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4324.42s)]
*  mercuries and things like that. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4330.74s)]
*  So along comes polio research. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4333.219999999999s)]
*  And the polio vaccine, even to this day, is made on African green monkey kidney cells. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4336.0199999999995s)]
*  Now, the African green monkey kidneys early on were basically taken out of their wild habitat [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4343.0599999999995s)]
*  in India, and millions of monkeys were brought to the USA for use. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4347.86s)]
*  Unbeknownst to them and discovered by a scientist named Dr. Bernice Eddy is that there was a [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4352.74s)]
*  cancer-causing entity inside of the substrate that they were using to make the vaccine on [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4358.74s)]
*  the petri dishes. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4367.139999999999s)]
*  And that entity was simianvirus 40, SV40, called SV40 because before there were 39 others [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4368.259999999999s)]
*  discovered before it. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4374.179999999999s)]
*  Now we're up over 100. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4375.219999999999s)]
*  So that information was suppressed heavily. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4377.38s)]
*  Bernice Eddy was offered a ticket to wherever she wanted to go and as much money as she [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4380.5s)]
*  wanted. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4384.02s)]
*  And she said, no, I'm staying. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4384.26s)]
*  Long story short, they just kept taking her away from her work and distracting her. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4385.78s)]
*  And there was another doctor, J. Anthony Morris, as well. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4389.7s)]
*  Anyway, so SV40 was around. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4393.06s)]
*  And then Maurice Hilleman validated it later and said it came from the African green monkey [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4395.22s)]
*  kidneys. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4399.22s)]
*  Now, it's benign in the African green monkey, SV40. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4400.1s)]
*  It is not benign in human beings. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4403.62s)]
*  In human beings, it was called the perfect war machine by Dr. Michelle Carboni, who was [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4405.3s)]
*  one of the primary researchers looking at the carcinogenic potential of simianvirus 40. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4409.62s)]
*  So simianvirus 40 would have been in the live polio vaccines because there was nothing to [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4414.26s)]
*  kill it. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4419.9400000000005s)]
*  But it was most likely also in the killed. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4420.820000000001s)]
*  And African green monkey cells are actually still a listed ingredient on vaccines. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4423.78s)]
*  So you can go ahead and look that up. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4428.820000000001s)]
*  It's a fact. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4430.26s)]
*  So how this affects me is that I'm a kidney specialist. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4431.94s)]
*  And I looked at the curve of kidney cancers that have gone up since the inception of polio [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4436.74s)]
*  vaccines and SV40 introduction. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4443.54s)]
*  So what this virus does is it enhances two cancer promoting genes and it inhibits two [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4445.86s)]
*  cancer suppressors. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4453.86s)]
*  OK, that's why it's called the perfect war machine. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4455.219999999999s)]
*  So that was in the vaccines that were injected. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4458.0199999999995s)]
*  And so the bad news is that we don't need vaccines to give it to us anymore because [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4460.42s)]
*  we're going to give it to each other forever. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4464.9s)]
*  And it's never going anywhere. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4466.34s)]
*  That was introduced to humanity like a lot of other diseases were through vaccination. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4467.54s)]
*  We can give it to our kids. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4471.62s)]
*  We can give it to each other. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4472.66s)]
*  It comes out in the urine. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4474.02s)]
*  And so it lives in the green monkey kidneys. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4475.46s)]
*  It lives in our kidneys. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4477.9400000000005s)]
*  As a kidney specialist, there were a lot of mysterious diseases. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4478.9800000000005s)]
*  Lo and behold, there was some research into some of them. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4482.42s)]
*  And the research was just put. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4485.62s)]
*  This is the other thing. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4486.82s)]
*  The research that's really important just gets killed. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4487.62s)]
*  The funding gets killed. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4490.42s)]
*  In terms of SV40 kidney cancers, there's no doubt that the rate of kidney cancers has [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4491.78s)]
*  gone up alongside with the infection rate of humanity for SV40, as well as diseases [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4495.94s)]
*  like glomerulonephritis, which they do find the pathogen genetic material inside. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4502.9s)]
*  And even in the old days, they found it in the tumors, but not the surrounding areas. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4509.62s)]
*  So that just tells you that it was a stimulant for the tumor cells to just start propagating. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4514.1s)]
*  So that's just one of the things that that's just one of many, many of the obvious ones. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4519.9400000000005s)]
*  And even though it's been well defined in the medical literature, you will see still [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4524.820000000001s)]
*  see that they only admit that it causes mesotheliomas and one other thing, not that it causes all the [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4529.22s)]
*  other things that it does that it's been shown to cause in the other medical literature that [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4533.860000000001s)]
*  got its funding revoked. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4537.700000000001s)]
*  So SV40 is now contagious amongst people? [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4539.54s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4544.0199999999995s)]
*  So probably both have it. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4545.46s)]
*  Most of us probably have had it one time or other, you know, whether it's lying dormant [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4547.379999999999s)]
*  in our kidneys, it depends on everything depends on your background immunity, which depends on [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4551.94s)]
*  what you're doing for fun and not fun and how you're eating and how much you're sleeping, [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4556.9s)]
*  etc. How much sun you're getting, sweating, sweating gets rid of a lot of stuff. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4560.9s)]
*  It's really good to sweat. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4565.78s)]
*  It's just such a disturbing thought that this was introduced to people through vaccines [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4566.98s)]
*  and now is spreading. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4571.94s)]
*  And what is the what's the like the worst health impact that it could have if it spreads to [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4572.9s)]
*  you and not through a vaccine? [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4577.46s)]
*  If you didn't get it through this vaccine and you just get it from another person like, [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4578.98s)]
*  Oh, it's the same thing. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4584.099999999999s)]
*  It's not going to make much difference in terms of it'll gravitate to your kidneys. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4585.139999999999s)]
*  Obviously, it probably goes to lung as well. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4589.46s)]
*  Brain brain tumors were a big problem with it back in the polio days. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4592.099999999999s)]
*  Dr. Michelle Carboni was looking at the brain tumors with that. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4596.9s)]
*  There's a really good book called The Virus and the Vaccine by Bookchin and Schumacher. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4600.98s)]
*  It's an incredible book that details everything about those years the scientists involved, [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4604.98s)]
*  the suppression, the oppression, the lies, the skullduggery. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4610.0199999999995s)]
*  Then they would bring in the scientist who had no experience in actually detecting SV 40. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4613.379999999999s)]
*  And lo and behold, he couldn't find it. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4617.62s)]
*  And he was the one that got to make the ultimate statement on whether SV 40 causes human disease [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4619.0599999999995s)]
*  or not. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4624.419999999999s)]
*  And how could they keep injecting that into people if they know this? [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4626.339999999999s)]
*  Oh, and the stocks that contained SV 40 were still basically being used by the vaccine [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4631.0599999999995s)]
*  manufacturers up into the 1990s and probably beyond because there's two different kinds of SV 40. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4637.379999999999s)]
*  You're making me remember a whole bunch of things that I thought I forgot. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4643.379999999999s)]
*  But there's the fast dividing and there's the slow dividing. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4646.339999999999s)]
*  There's two different kind of strains of it. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4650.66s)]
*  And the original test, so when they made a vaccine, they would test it for 14 days looking [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4652.82s)]
*  for SV 40. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4657.139999999999s)]
*  If it didn't have it, off you went and your vaccine was good to go. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4657.86s)]
*  But the problem is there was a slower dividing SV 40 that remained in the vaccines that were [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4661.54s)]
*  injected and probably in the stocks that are still. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4667.139999999999s)]
*  The stock is basically like your mother tincture or whatever. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4669.219999999999s)]
*  It's what you use to kind of inoculate all the new batches over time. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4672.98s)]
*  And so the stocks were found. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4676.98s)]
*  Again, quote Dr. Attorney Stanley Copp's quote in the book about the SV 40 still being in the stock [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4678.42s)]
*  up and through the 1990s. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4686.02s)]
*  And God only knows if they're still using those same stocks. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4687.62s)]
*  I don't know because I haven't gone into the more modern times of SV 40. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4692.66s)]
*  But yeah, we all have it. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4696.66s)]
*  And there's no doubt in my mind that it's just like another one of the things that the [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4697.860000000001s)]
*  parasites have finally pretty much put into us to set us back. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4701.9400000000005s)]
*  Demons. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4706.58s)]
*  It's like real world demons. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4708.58s)]
*  It's so crazy that someone would know this and still have this as an ingredient in a vaccine. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4711.3s)]
*  Well, they'll say that it was just an unfortunate set of events that happened because they took [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4718.34s)]
*  wild monkeys from India. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4723.22s)]
*  See, I could work for them. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4724.5s)]
*  That's their excuse. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4726.02s)]
*  And they say we cleaned it up. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4726.9800000000005s)]
*  We started our own monkey colonies and we started breeding our own monkey colonies that [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4728.58s)]
*  were now found to be free of SV 40. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4732.26s)]
*  The only problem with that is that, as I said, they had already inoculated humanity. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4735.14s)]
*  And it's with a virus that can be spread vertically and horizontally, as the scientists [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4739.3s)]
*  would describe, meaning we've all given it to each other. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4744.34s)]
*  I think there are going to be very few people walking around today that haven't been [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4747.22s)]
*  introduced to it. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4750.26s)]
*  Have there ever been a comparison of pre-cancer rates, pre-SV 40, and post-SV 40? [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4751.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4758.66s)]
*  What I did is I, in one of my videos, I did that and looked at the cancer rates since [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4760.0199999999995s)]
*  they were, you know, so again, what they'll say is, well, we just didn't look at the rates [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4765.3s)]
*  beforehand, but the rates were quite low before. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4769.0599999999995s)]
*  You can know what the surgical, what the nephrectomies were. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4772.9s)]
*  It's kind of an easy thing to look at because that's the treatment for kidney cancer. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4776.0199999999995s)]
*  You take the kidney out because you got another kidney and it's a slow growing tumor, even [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4779.3s)]
*  though it can metastasize. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4784.42s)]
*  But anyway, I did look at it and the rate has skyrocketed for kidney cancers. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4785.86s)]
*  Pretty much everybody knows somebody who had a kidney cancer. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4792.099999999999s)]
*  And that was not common? [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4795.94s)]
*  No. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4797.86s)]
*  And also these protein losing diseases, which is, again, it's not controversial. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4800.9s)]
*  It was documented when they looked at the areas that were affected in the kidney, which [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4804.98s)]
*  with these horrible disease that makes people lose the proteins that need to stay in their [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4809.86s)]
*  blood and their body out into their urine that the SV40 was related to that. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4813.78s)]
*  It's called focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis and it's a real problematic disease in children [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4818.66s)]
*  and adults. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4823.7s)]
*  Ultimately, you have to go on horrible chemotherapy drugs that ruin your immune system and then [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4824.82s)]
*  transplantation if you can't stay on top of it. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4829.7s)]
*  Big moneymaker. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4832.5s)]
*  Now, do I think that that was the purpose? [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4834.34s)]
*  Look, I don't know what was in the hearts and minds. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4836.099999999999s)]
*  I don't know what was accidental or what wasn't, but I do know that there was intentional [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4838.179999999999s)]
*  suppression of the truth. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4841.94s)]
*  Any doubts, whether or not well-funded, must not be allowed to exist. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4843.46s)]
*  That is a fact and it's always been that way. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4847.22s)]
*  And there have been scientists and doctors talking about that since the beginning of [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4849.22s)]
*  vaccination. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4853.06s)]
*  It's just too horrible to believe for most people, I think. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4855.22s)]
*  And then also, you're correct. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4858.1s)]
*  It goes against religious dogma, you know, especially with people that are like firmly [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4859.78s)]
*  on the left, trusting the science and trusting the experts. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4866.5s)]
*  Those are those are two things at the front. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4870.9800000000005s)]
*  It's kind of a childlike situation that humanity and most of humanity is in is that [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4873.38s)]
*  there, you know, I think most people are good and they want to believe everybody else is [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4877.78s)]
*  good and they want to believe that the government is looking out for them. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4881.46s)]
*  And it's really it's a kind of horrifying. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4884.34s)]
*  Imagine if it was true that your government actually wasn't looking out for you. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4886.66s)]
*  And that might be one of the causes of your decreasing lifespan. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4890.18s)]
*  Imagine that if the government might not care so much if your baby ends up with no stem [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4893.78s)]
*  cells or your baby gets cancer or autism, which will be outright. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4898.26s)]
*  And I mean, look at autism. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4901.7s)]
*  Hello. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4903.22s)]
*  Like, do we how many? [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4904.02s)]
*  I mean, we're to start with that. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4906.42s)]
*  But that was another thing where there was no doubt whether or not well-funded allowed [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4907.860000000001s)]
*  to exist. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4913.38s)]
*  What came to autism and every autistic parent parent of an autistic child will tell you [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4914.34s)]
*  this. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4919.38s)]
*  Everyone that's tried to lobby and get to the truth with autism will tell you that the [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4919.62s)]
*  brick walls and the plexiglass and the lead walls that went down were intense and still [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4923.14s)]
*  are intense. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4929.3s)]
*  And the lying studies that they use to uphold vaccines don't cause autism are so easy to [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4930.02s)]
*  dismantle. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4936.580000000001s)]
*  But you know, Joe, you know, the lie gets around the earth three times before the truth [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4937.38s)]
*  has a chance to get out of bed. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4941.540000000001s)]
*  And that's just pretty much what happens when the media is owned. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4942.820000000001s)]
*  And like you're like one of the cracks in the matrix here, quite frankly. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4946.9800000000005s)]
*  I think for a lot of people, it's too horrible to believe, especially if they have an autistic [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4951.860000000001s)]
*  child, that this was caused by a vaccine. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4956.18s)]
*  I know a guy who told me that he believes the vaccine had an impact on his child having [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4959.3s)]
*  autism and then later was shaming people for not taking the COVID vaccine. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4967.22s)]
*  That's how strong the impulse is. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4973.54s)]
*  And that's how good the propaganda was. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4976.74s)]
*  And that's how cowardly a lot of people are when it comes to fighting against a narrative. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4979.78s)]
*  They get very scared of being socially ostracized and they can't speak their mind. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4985.86s)]
*  They can't tell the truth and they'll whisper it to maybe this one guy that they're friends [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4990.5s)]
*  with like, hey, you know, I don't want to take it, man, but I have to for work. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4993.7s)]
*  Like, yeah, I don't trust them either. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4997.139999999999s)]
*  But you know, shh, don't tell anybody I said that. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=4999.139999999999s)]
*  You know, you don't want anybody thinking you're on the bad side. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5001.0599999999995s)]
*  And we all saw the propaganda on television. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5004.0199999999995s)]
*  There's some amazing montages that people put together lately of people saying horrible [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5006.0199999999995s)]
*  things about the vaccinated people, unvaccinated people, horrible things. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5011.7s)]
*  Saying that it's it may be ghoulish to laugh when unvaccinated people die, [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5015.86s)]
*  but it might be necessary. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5021.219999999999s)]
*  Like what? [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5023.94s)]
*  Few of us have to take one for the team. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5025.219999999999s)]
*  It was just the weirdest propaganda campaign and people were doing the job of the man. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5027.38s)]
*  It wasn't the man forcing the people to do this thing. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5033.219999999999s)]
*  It was people doing the job of the man and going after the people that hadn't stepped in line. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5036.34s)]
*  And I think for a lot of people, it's like they felt terrible that they had to do it. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5042.42s)]
*  But if they did it now, I'm righteous. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5046.1s)]
*  Now I'm on the good side. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5048.82s)]
*  Why don't you do it too, man? [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5050.26s)]
*  I fucking did it. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5051.62s)]
*  You should do it too. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5052.5s)]
*  You're fucking selfish. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5053.62s)]
*  You get a lot of that. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5055.06s)]
*  You know, you get a lot of people who they know they made a mistake [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5056.26s)]
*  and they want you to make that mistake too. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5058.82s)]
*  You know? [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5060.42s)]
*  Yeah, it would be good to know what really goes through their heads. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5061.7s)]
*  I think COVID was again, it was unique. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5063.9400000000005s)]
*  But when you talk to parents who have autistic children, the vast majority of them, [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5067.3s)]
*  not only know absolutely without a doubt that their child became autistic, [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5072.1s)]
*  usually within 24 to 48 hours after a certain vaccine, [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5076.900000000001s)]
*  but that every doctor told them it wasn't the case. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5080.660000000001s)]
*  And then they go digging deep into the scientific literature [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5083.14s)]
*  and learn how to sometimes resuscitate that child's brain or detox them [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5085.780000000001s)]
*  and then recover them. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5089.620000000001s)]
*  And then they're actually beaten up even worse for doing that [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5090.900000000001s)]
*  because they're just neurodiverse. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5095.620000000001s)]
*  You know, there's nothing wrong with your child. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5097.06s)]
*  They're just quirky. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5098.5s)]
*  No, your child banging its head against the wall, [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5099.86s)]
*  walking around with a baby bottle and a diaper at the age of 18, [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5102.0199999999995s)]
*  your big hairy son doing that, that is not neurodiverse quirkiness. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5104.98s)]
*  That is a serious pathological disease that probably could have been dealt to at the time [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5108.5s)]
*  and should have been prevented, should have never happened. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5112.82s)]
*  So most parents that have that situation are on fire. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5115.38s)]
*  It's a minority that will say, have the situation that you have right now. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5118.42s)]
*  Most of them, that's a wake up call, which is why they get beat up and suppressed [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5122.74s)]
*  even worse than I do. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5126.58s)]
*  But when it comes to COVID, the psychological campaign, I think, was very effective [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5128.34s)]
*  in that people that I would have never imagined took the jab. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5135.139999999999s)]
*  Like friends of mine who I, in a million years, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5138.0199999999995s)]
*  I would have bet my life that they would say no to it, ended up getting it, [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5140.82s)]
*  didn't want it, were really upset about it later, but nonetheless did it. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5143.86s)]
*  Have they read your book? [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5147.38s)]
*  Yes. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5148.58s)]
*  I see I didn't lose any friends during COVID because I had already lost them back in like 2009. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5150.42s)]
*  My family and friends were solid. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5154.82s)]
*  My tribe is here. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5156.58s)]
*  But yeah, so I still love this person and she's like really upset about it. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5157.94s)]
*  But it's like, it just shows you that the psychological campaign, [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5164.42s)]
*  like to get into that person's brain was really into like, but I don't know about you, [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5168.34s)]
*  but there was, I never had a doubt. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5173.14s)]
*  I never, I was like, well, you're going to shut me down, shut me down. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5175.54s)]
*  You're going to stop me from traveling. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5178.18s)]
*  Go ahead, stop me from traveling. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5179.22s)]
*  I hadn't read your book yet. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5180.26s)]
*  And I was all gung-ho to get the vaccine. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5181.86s)]
*  And the UFC had allocated 150 something vaccines for all their employees. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5185.219999999999s)]
*  We were doing shows during the pandemic. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5190.179999999999s)]
*  So I showed up in Vegas, asked for the shot. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5192.74s)]
*  They said I couldn't do it. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5196.179999999999s)]
*  I had to do it on Monday at the clinic. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5197.0599999999995s)]
*  I couldn't do it at the UFC. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5199.46s)]
*  I was like, okay, fine. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5200.66s)]
*  And they said, can you come back in two weeks and do it when they're in the next UFC fight? [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5202.42s)]
*  I said, fine, I'll do it then. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5206.26s)]
*  During that time, it got pulled from the market for blood clots. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5207.94s)]
*  Which one, which jab was it? [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5211.38s)]
*  Johnson and Johnson. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5212.42s)]
*  Okay. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5213.219999999999s)]
*  And then two people I knew who got it had strokes. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5213.7s)]
*  Okay. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5216.9s)]
*  In that two weeks? [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5217.38s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5218.42s)]
*  Well, you've got a few angels, don't you? [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5218.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5220.5s)]
*  And I was like, hold on. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5220.66s)]
*  And then my whole family got it. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5222.5s)]
*  There was like a bunch of things that happened. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5223.86s)]
*  My whole family got it and everybody was fine. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5225.22s)]
*  And I didn't get it. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5227.0599999999995s)]
*  And I was trying to get it. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5228.42s)]
*  Like I had sex with my wife. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5229.86s)]
*  I hugged my kids. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5231.139999999999s)]
*  You mean you didn't get COVID? [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5232.0199999999995s)]
*  No, I didn't get it. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5233.0599999999995s)]
*  But you didn't get the jab either? [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5233.78s)]
*  No. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5235.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5235.62s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5235.94s)]
*  But I didn't get it first time around. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5236.9s)]
*  I was like, this is crazy. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5238.5s)]
*  There was two days when I went to the gym because I was trying to get it. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5239.78s)]
*  Which sounds horrible. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5242.82s)]
*  You're not allowed to not get it, Joe. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5243.7s)]
*  I just wanted to get over it. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5245.06s)]
*  My kids got over it so fast. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5246.66s)]
*  Like my one daughter was one day, she had kind of a headache and she tested for COVID. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5248.900000000001s)]
*  She thought it was hilarious. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5252.74s)]
*  She started laughing. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5253.62s)]
*  She's like, oh my God, I have COVID. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5255.38s)]
*  But we had already told them it's not dangerous for kids. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5256.5s)]
*  Don't worry about it at all. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5258.82s)]
*  Because there was a lot of kids that were talking about getting vaccinated. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5260.5s)]
*  I'm like, you are not getting it. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5262.82s)]
*  For them, I was like, no way. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5264.82s)]
*  I'll do it if I have to work. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5267.22s)]
*  But what made you say no way? [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5267.860000000001s)]
*  Like what did you think about it that you didn't even want your child [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5269.22s)]
*  to get it just in case? [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5272.02s)]
*  Totally unnecessary. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5272.9800000000005s)]
*  So no need to risk it. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5274.580000000001s)]
*  Totally unnecessary. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5275.9400000000005s)]
*  They got COVID. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5277.06s)]
*  They got over it like that. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5278.26s)]
*  But what risk did you think they would have? [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5279.3s)]
*  Before the vaccine. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5280.740000000001s)]
*  But this is before the vaccine. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5281.540000000001s)]
*  So after that, I was like, there's no way. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5282.580000000001s)]
*  Because there was pressure from their friends to get vaccinated. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5284.9800000000005s)]
*  I was like, you're not getting vaccinated. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5287.3s)]
*  You have seven times better immunity than someone who gets vaccinated, which is proof. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5289.46s)]
*  And this is just antibodies, right? [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5294.02s)]
*  Which you enlightened me in your book to the fact that there's cellular immunity. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5296.34s)]
*  That's different than just antibodies. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5301.62s)]
*  Antibodies is one type of immunity to things, right? [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5303.3s)]
*  That's right. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5306.82s)]
*  It's that TH2 slant that we were talking about. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5308.66s)]
*  For me, with my kids, it's like they're vaccinated. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5310.82s)]
*  But we did it on a delayed schedule because that's what my doctor recommended. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5313.86s)]
*  And we had a really good pediatrician. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5317.14s)]
*  And it worked out great. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5318.5s)]
*  They're fine. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5319.46s)]
*  But I was a little worried. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5320.42s)]
*  I thought it was quack-like to be worried. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5322.9s)]
*  Like this is science. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5325.14s)]
*  Like back then. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5326.18s)]
*  Worried about what? [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5326.5s)]
*  What vaccines could do to the kids. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5327.7s)]
*  The regular ones. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5329.0599999999995s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5329.94s)]
*  And the schedule. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5330.58s)]
*  The way they wanted to just bang them up. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5331.54s)]
*  Like real quick. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5333.46s)]
*  And with weird ones. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5334.58s)]
*  Like the hepatitis B one. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5335.54s)]
*  That one was like, when I hear that, I'm like, what are you talking about? [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5337.22s)]
*  You're going to give a kid for a sexually transmitted disease a vaccine when they're a baby? [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5341.78s)]
*  A one-day-old baby. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5345.7s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5346.74s)]
*  And also, is their immune system even working right? [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5348.18s)]
*  I mean, will it even accept this and turn it into an antibody? [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5351.62s)]
*  Like, have you approved that? [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5355.62s)]
*  Like you're just jabbing kids? [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5358.18s)]
*  They're proving that the infant will make antibody. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5359.7s)]
*  And that's all they ever have to prove. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5362.099999999999s)]
*  What they don't ever want to prove is that when you give, [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5364.0199999999995s)]
*  say your child had gotten a COVID vaccine, there's something called original antigenic sin. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5367.86s)]
*  They changed the term to linked epitope suppression. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5372.5s)]
*  It happens with flu shots. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5374.66s)]
*  It happens with lots of different vaccines. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5375.94s)]
*  Is that if you program your body to attack the strain of vaccine that you're, a virus rather, [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5377.86s)]
*  that you are injecting against, and then a different strain comes along, [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5384.34s)]
*  it actually has negative efficacy. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5388.26s)]
*  You are one that's more likely to succumb to terrible problems from the infection [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5389.780000000001s)]
*  than because of your vaccine rather than actually protecting you. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5394.18s)]
*  And that's been a well-known look. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5397.780000000001s)]
*  Anthony Fauci writes about it. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5399.14s)]
*  Morin's and Fauci wrote a paper basically admitting everything. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5400.66s)]
*  I think it was in 2023 or 2024 about these shots. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5404.66s)]
*  And he said the COVID shots are exactly the same as the flu shots. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5407.62s)]
*  Despite that, despite Fauci and Morin's talking about how these shots would never have been [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5410.9800000000005s)]
*  licensed if they were held to the same standards of DPT, et cetera, et cetera, [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5415.46s)]
*  that they don't provide lung immunity, only provide blood immunity, negative efficacy. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5418.58s)]
*  Their conclusion at the end of it is that we must make better vaccines, more effective vaccines, [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5422.9800000000005s)]
*  to add to the already existing vaccine program. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5428.26s)]
*  It's not that we shouldn't do this. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5430.66s)]
*  It's not that we should pull this off the market. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5432.5s)]
*  That's always the logic. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5434.58s)]
*  Again, they are not, they never will admit to any problem with vaccines to take it off the market. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5436.5s)]
*  It's always adding to it, not removing a vaccine. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5442.26s)]
*  You think it was bad? [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5445.62s)]
*  Let's start six months now. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5446.58s)]
*  Six-month-old babies with parents that are just like you back in the day going, [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5448.02s)]
*  okay, if you really think it's necessary because, oh, granny doesn't want to catch COVID, [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5451.38s)]
*  we're going to do it. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5456.42s)]
*  Yeah, that was the logic. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5457.38s)]
*  Worry about granny. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5459.46s)]
*  But this is the Great Barrington Declaration, right? [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5460.42s)]
*  Where those guys were like, why don't we take the people that are vulnerable [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5463.06s)]
*  and isolate them and treat them and care for them and not worry so much about everybody else [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5467.86s)]
*  and not shut society down because it's going to have profound impacts. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5474.74s)]
*  And they were called kooks. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5478.58s)]
*  And that's what's crazy. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5480.58s)]
*  It's like during the censorship was so rampant that prominent scientists and physicians [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5481.46s)]
*  were removed from the social conversation because they disagreed. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5491.0599999999995s)]
*  That's always been the case, though. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5496.82s)]
*  That's always been... [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5498.099999999999s)]
*  It's just, but what is happening on social media, and it's so transparent. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5498.82s)]
*  These people are getting removed from Twitter. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5502.74s)]
*  This is wild. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5504.5s)]
*  This is so crazy. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5506.66s)]
*  Then you find out that the government's involved. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5507.46s)]
*  The government contacted them and asked them to take things down. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5509.62s)]
*  You're like, what are you saying? [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5512.5s)]
*  This is nuts. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5516.34s)]
*  Medical papers were retracted. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5517.62s)]
*  There's this one guy named Pradhan, P-R-A-D-H-A-N, [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5519.22s)]
*  who he showed that there is a GP120 protein on the spike. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5522.02s)]
*  And he said it was an uncanny similarity to the GP120 in HIV, [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5530.5s)]
*  and that there was no way that that would have come out of nowhere [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5535.14s)]
*  and showed up in the 2019 COVID epidemic. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5537.78s)]
*  And he showed genetically how that just couldn't possibly happen. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5541.38s)]
*  Flurry of emails went through the CDC and to NIAD and to Fauci. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5545.38s)]
*  And within six days of that paper being in pre-print, it was removed. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5549.9400000000005s)]
*  Six days. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5554.82s)]
*  And we've got access from the Freedom of Information Act to some of those emails. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5556.02s)]
*  They're a bit heavily redacted, but that was the series of events that happened with that, [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5559.78s)]
*  because any doubts whether or not well-founded. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5565.0599999999995s)]
*  All the things you said about the COVID vaccine, I'm sure are correct and true. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5568.099999999999s)]
*  But isn't it also different than the vaccine that they used in the test? [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5572.9s)]
*  Yes. The vaccine that was produced for the general public, [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5577.54s)]
*  I believe at least when it comes to Pfizer, they used magnetic beads for purification, [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5582.259999999999s)]
*  which was totally different to what they did for the one they gave to us. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5589.46s)]
*  And they produced it using, I can't remember exactly how they produced it, [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5592.42s)]
*  but they didn't use plasmids and they didn't use all the different components that were given to us. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5597.46s)]
*  I have a slide on that somewhere that I could show you about. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5603.78s)]
*  There were two aspects of the test vaccine that were very different to, [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5606.26s)]
*  it was both the production, how they produced it, and how they, quote, purified it. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5610.82s)]
*  And what's the significance of the differences? Did they do it to save money? [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5616.42s)]
*  They just didn't have the plasmid. They wouldn't have had the lipopolysaccharide with the DNA from [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5620.66s)]
*  the E. coli that was in there that they told would never get past our deltoid muscle and would be [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5626.5s)]
*  disintegrated. Well, lipopolysaccharide actually is a transit protein that can bring everything [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5630.98s)]
*  right through your cells into your, our cells are made of, it's like a lipid on the outside. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5635.78s)]
*  So that was the whole purpose was to shuttle this into your cells. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5640.58s)]
*  Not only that, but the, the, the vaccine produced that, that the plasmid part of the vaccine that's [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5644.02s)]
*  injected into you, the messenger RNA has a substitution for something called uridine. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5650.34s)]
*  They call it pseudo-uridine and pseudo-uridine was put in there because they didn't want the [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5655.06s)]
*  immune system to destroy the vaccine too quickly. They wanted it to really be able to take hold of [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5659.860000000001s)]
*  your body so you could have a strong response. Well, that's one of the reasons why vaccinated [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5664.42s)]
*  people had such, you know, horrible time with actual coronavirus when it did come. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5669.38s)]
*  And one of the reasons why you didn't, maybe you were exposed and you don't, [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5674.5s)]
*  I don't know if you've had an antibody level tested. But again, that's another long history [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5678.02s)]
*  thing is people who don't get sick while everyone else is have been, have been accused of witchcraft [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5682.74s)]
*  and sorcerers in the past and sometimes hunted down and killed, you know, in the times of smallpox, [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5687.22s)]
*  the groups of people that were into cleanliness and that was, that was a real problem for them. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5693.22s)]
*  I did do nasal swabs to see if I had any antibodies. I did do that and I didn't. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5698.58s)]
*  Well, that won't tell you antibodies. That just, that's a PCR. That would be your PCR test or your [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5705.0599999999995s)]
*  rapid. Which one did you do? The one that goes- The rapid. The rapid antigen test. But that's only [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5709.7s)]
*  going to tell you if you've got active in your nose. What you want to know is if your immune [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5714.0199999999995s)]
*  system, again, there's a good use for antibodies sometimes. It's not to see, it's not, not the end [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5718.34s)]
*  all be all in terms of your immunity, but it will show that you have had an experience inside of [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5722.98s)]
*  your body with COVID. And so- What was bizarre to me was that there was this, there was this [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5727.7s)]
*  narrative that you were going to get it no matter what. And that's why- And this will stop it from [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5732.98s)]
*  you getting it. Yeah. Well, it was, this is before the vaccine was even around. There was this, [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5738.0199999999995s)]
*  there's this talk that there's no way to not get it. Like if it's around you, it's so contagious, [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5743.0599999999995s)]
*  you're going to get it. And that's why I was shocked that I didn't get it when my whole family [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5748.419999999999s)]
*  got it. Like I said, I didn't isolate at all. I did it on purpose. And I had two days in the gym [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5752.26s)]
*  where I was sluggish. And so I was like, I feel kind of tired today, but a weird tired. So I'm [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5758.18s)]
*  just going to go through the motions. I just like really light workout. And the next day I felt the [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5764.34s)]
*  same thing, like, yeah, another light workout. Let's just take it easy. No need to push it. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5769.3s)]
*  Just got to break a little sweat, never stressed myself. And then the next day I felt great. I [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5773.3s)]
*  felt a hundred percent. Like I started working. I was like, Oh, I feel good. And then I was fine. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5779.22s)]
*  And it's like, okay, I guess I didn't get it. And then every one of my family recovered. And then I [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5783.14s)]
*  went from there to a couple months later, I was doing this gig in Florida. And I was up with my [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5788.66s)]
*  friend, John Showman, who's a pool. He makes pool cues. Shout out to John, good friend of mine. And [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5796.5s)]
*  we were playing pool till like five o'clock in the morning. And I had like five margaritas and we're [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5801.46s)]
*  having a good old time and laughing a lot. And then that night I was like, Oh, I don't feel so [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5805.38s)]
*  good. But it was alcohol and no sleep and playing pool and, you know, and big shows and giant arenas [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5811.7s)]
*  and flying on jets and being tired all the time. You know, that's what it was. And then I got sick. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5820.02s)]
*  But even then it was like a couple of days. How was that? How close was that to the time? You just [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5825.14s)]
*  said you felt a little tired in the gym that day. A few months. Okay. A few months. Yeah, [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5829.78s)]
*  it was a few months because by that time the vaccine had been out. And this was, I guess, [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5833.94s)]
*  the Delta, which was everybody was like, this is a bad one. The Delta is not bad one. You're [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5838.66s)]
*  supposed to be fearful, you know. Yeah, it was a it was a shocking time for me because before that, [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5843.0599999999995s)]
*  I never would have guessed in a million years that I would be even questioning other vaccines. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5847.78s)]
*  I would have never guessed that I would have told you that vaccines are one of the most important [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5855.54s)]
*  inventions in human history. And it's like saved us from polio. It saved us from smallpox. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5859.46s)]
*  I would have been that guy ranting off all those statistics. I would have told you that. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5863.62s)]
*  But then I read your book. I read. Sorry. Sorry. I read Robert F. Kennedy's book. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5868.74s)]
*  I read your book and I started reading Turtles All the Way Down, which also which is really [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5875.86s)]
*  interesting because they wrote another book called Turtles All the Way Down and someone else [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5880.82s)]
*  published it that has almost the identical cover. And that book is a pro vaccine. Nice. Like they [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5884.82s)]
*  literally hijacked. They're like, what do we do? Oh, this is what we do. We fucking confuse the [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5891.62s)]
*  shit out of people. Make one with the exact same cover, exact same cover, exact same name. Wow. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5895.46s)]
*  And they made it a pro vaccine book. It's kind of wild. I mean, it's really kind of a genius. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5901.14s)]
*  Like, what a great way to like flood the market with bullshit. And the RFK Junior book was bananas. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5905.0599999999995s)]
*  I mean, I people had told me to read it. And my initial in the Fauci book. Yes. Yeah. My initial [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5911.7s)]
*  thought was that's that guy that's like that anti vaccine kook. That's what I thought. And I've [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5917.86s)]
*  apologized to him for that. When I talked to him on the podcast, I said to him, I said, I, I, I [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5923.139999999999s)]
*  seek, I succumbed like everybody else did to the casual narrative was the casual narrative. Oh, [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5928.58s)]
*  that RFK guys are kook talks weird, got a weird voice, ruining the world's immunity. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5934.74s)]
*  Well, I had the same thing. Like, you know, when I was first waking up, I had a friend who had [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5939.78s)]
*  unvaccinated kids that were part of a Steiner school. And they were like mutant freaks to me [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5943.54s)]
*  because they'd never been on the antibiotic. They were like bright and happy and interactive [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5948.5s)]
*  and talented. And at one point, one of them was playing with a hammer and nail. And I said to [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5952.98s)]
*  her mother, I was like, you got to be careful because she doesn't have a tetanus vaccine. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5958.34s)]
*  And someone in the room said, well, Suzanne, what do you know about tetanus? And like in my head, [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5962.58s)]
*  I'm a full fledged doctor at this point. I thought, I don't know anything. And outside, I said, [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5967.46s)]
*  I know you don't want to get it. And I know it'll cause lockjaw. And then I started reading [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5972.82s)]
*  about tetanus and I had to go back and, you know, kind of apologize. And then I did a big video. I [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5976.259999999999s)]
*  have a big video out on tetanus and the actual truth about the tetanus vaccines and actual tetanus, [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5980.9s)]
*  which, you know, that's even harder for most people. Like most people who don't want to [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5985.54s)]
*  vaccinate their kids, they'll vaccinate for tetanus if they can get a single shot. And second only to [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5989.54s)]
*  polio. Everybody's got their two vaccines that they're the two diseases they're afraid of for [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5993.46s)]
*  the kid that makes them feel like they're at least doing something. Well, the polio one always gets [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=5997.78s)]
*  thrown in my face. Yeah. They say it all the time about polio. Yeah. And I just go, I don't [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6001.54s)]
*  have the time to do this. Thank you. I just explained to someone the whole DDT connection [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6005.86s)]
*  and the fact that livestock was getting polio. Like this is the thing, like polio, dogs don't [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6014.42s)]
*  get polio. They don't get human derived polio. It doesn't cross species, but they were getting [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6020.26s)]
*  paralytic polio symptoms because they were getting poisoned by DDT. Right? That was a big part of the [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6025.62s)]
*  whole thing that was very confusing. Well, they started killing dogs, you know, in New York, [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6032.42s)]
*  in that incidence I told you about where the vaccine, the gain of function strain escaped, [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6037.54s)]
*  people were throwing their cats out the window. Some 20,000 cats in New York City were killed [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6043.86s)]
*  during that time because there was a belief that cats spread the disease. Oh my God. Jesus Christ. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6047.7s)]
*  That's so crazy. And it was all a mutant manmade virus. The manmade virus thing is a wound up [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6055.62s)]
*  virus. Wound up. It was basically a natural virus that got kind of wound up by humans. So manmade to [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6062.099999999999s)]
*  the final form. Yeah. That's just crazy that that's a thing that we do because if this gain [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6068.0199999999995s)]
*  of function research was so important, wouldn't you have a cure, like ready? Like have you been studying [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6074.18s)]
*  this for so long, but didn't they, but it didn't, didn't really cure it. Right. Oh, you know, I mean, [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6079.38s)]
*  wouldn't you have something that like stops it dead in its tracks? It's not allowed to cure it. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6084.02s)]
*  Look, I was living in a country where the government said there's no cure for COVID. There [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6087.14s)]
*  is no treatment for it and there is no prevention for it except the vaccine. And lo and behold, [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6093.06s)]
*  we found out that there was a contract between the government and the pharmaceutical industry [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6098.1s)]
*  to have the emergency use of the vaccine trial on the population only under the condition that [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6102.1s)]
*  there is no other treatment available. And that's why the treatments were shut down. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6109.62s)]
*  Right. Because emergency use, there has to be no other treatment available. If you have ivermectin [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6113.86s)]
*  or if you have zinc and all the other things that we use with success. You know, there were so many [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6118.98s)]
*  people that I treated that should have been dead. I gave COVID to a 95 year old woman who had chronic [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6123.94s)]
*  lung disease called bronchiectasis. She should have been the low hanging fruit. I was starting to feel [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6129.86s)]
*  a little bit unhappy one day, really just sluggish, like you mentioned. And when I was done seeing her [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6134.9s)]
*  she said, I just want to give you a hug. And she came over and I was going, Oh no. And after about [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6139.46s)]
*  three days, I was like, I've definitely got it. I tested and I rang her daughter. And I said, I've [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6144.26s)]
*  got to tell you, I was exposed Margie was exposed to blah, blah, blah. And she's like, yeah, mom's [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6149.54s)]
*  not feeling so good right now. And then two weeks later, I thought I've got to call back again. I've [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6154.66s)]
*  got to make sure this lady's okay. She said, Oh no, mom's out at the hairdresser getting her hair [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6159.7s)]

*  She probably used to. I don't know if she can't remember that detail. But there was my senior [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6169.46s)]
*  partner had leukemia. He should have been absolutely, absolutely dead. Well, not on my watch. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6173.78s)]
*  He wasn't going to be dead. So he'd survived the entire thing and died like two years later of [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6177.78s)]
*  something else. So yeah, the most shocking aspect of getting attacked and like all the CNN stuff to [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6181.78s)]
*  me was that no one had any interest in why I recovered so quickly. Because if this is supposed [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6188.9800000000005s)]
*  to be this death sentence and there's no treatment and then I'm a guy in my fifties and I got over it [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6196.42s)]
*  quick and then no one cared at all about that. All they wanted to do is mock this idea that I was [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6203.78s)]
*  taking veterinary medicine, right? Which I wasn't, but it was just the fact that they use that term [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6209.62s)]
*  horse dewormer on every TV show on it. Like, wow, this is, it's wild to watch the machine. It's [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6216.1s)]
*  uniquely wild when it's coming after you. And you're like, but this is like such a dumb checkers play. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6223.94s)]
*  I'm like, this is so stupid. I'm still doing my podcast. You fucking idiots. And like, everyone's [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6229.379999999999s)]
*  going to know that you put a green filter over my face. I'm going to show everybody that you think [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6233.94s)]
*  you're just going to get away with that. No, you're going to like lose all of your credibility. You [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6238.259999999999s)]
*  idiots. It was just so fascinating to watch like this distorted understanding of like what America [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6242.339999999999s)]
*  is willing to believe or the world is willing to believe. Like you're only preaching to the converted, [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6250.34s)]
*  the super hardcore, closed minded, converted people. Everyone else knows you guys are a joke now. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6258.42s)]
*  And that's the good part of getting through COVID. The good part of this enormous gas lighting [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6264.58s)]
*  experience that we all just went through where people are finally after four years, apologizing [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6271.38s)]
*  to friends, you know, for calling them a plague rat, you know, like, like literally they got down [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6276.82s)]
*  to that where friends couldn't be friends with people anymore because they weren't vaccinated. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6282.74s)]
*  And people are kind of like realizing like, oh my God, not only did I get COVID more than anybody else [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6287.86s)]
*  because I got three shots, like I had a friend telling this. He goes, I got COVID more than [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6293.94s)]
*  everyone I know. And I had all three shots. He's like, I got COVID eight fucking times. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6298.58s)]
*  And we're like, how many times did you get it? And everybody that got it naturally was like, [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6303.78s)]
*  I got it once. Maybe I got it as I got it twice. But the second time I got it, it was literally a [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6307.139999999999s)]
*  sniffy nose, just literally a snitch. And I was joking because we used to test everyone, including [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6311.7s)]
*  the, the guests, everyone that came here, we tested for COVID. And I was joking. I'm like, [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6316.9s)]
*  maybe this is it. Maybe I got it again. And she's like, you actually got it. I was like, no way. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6322.259999999999s)]
*  This is COVID. And it never got worse. It stopped right there. It was, that was it one day, [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6327.94s)]
*  one day of a sniffly nose. And then a couple of days later, I said, all right, let's try and get [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6333.0599999999995s)]
*  tested again, see if we can still do another podcast. And that was good. But I had to cancel [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6338.259999999999s)]
*  the podcast. You're not allowed to have a healthy immune system. You're not allowed. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6342.66s)]
*  The fact that, that's the thing. It's like, there's real science behind all the things you talk about [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6346.58s)]
*  in your book in terms of like the, the nutritional aspects of healthy foods being an important [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6354.1s)]
*  factor in your immune system, healthy, we were talking about juices and vegetable juices and [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6363.22s)]
*  all the different times that it's helped people overcome certain diseases and vitamin A and cod [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6367.780000000001s)]
*  liver oil, which also has vitamin A, which was always prescribed to people that were sick. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6373.46s)]
*  Like all these things are, this is real science. Like there's real science in nutritional [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6377.700000000001s)]
*  supplementation and the effects that it has on the immune system. And there's a real science [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6381.7s)]
*  in nutritional deficiencies and what a negative impact it has. This is all real. And if they truly [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6385.94s)]
*  cared about you, they would be telling you about that as a primary way of defending your body [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6391.22s)]
*  against disease and against all sorts of things that could go wrong, all sorts of things like [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6397.3s)]
*  get fit, eat healthy, and you're above everything. Take supplements. You're above everything. Like [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6404.26s)]
*  you're in the top 1% of people that are going to do great in life when it comes to getting sick, [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6410.18s)]
*  just that. And cause most people don't do that. So you have like, what percentage of people like [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6414.900000000001s)]
*  really eat healthy and really try to exercise on a regular basis? Is it even 10? Is it even 10% of [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6419.46s)]
*  us? It depends. I get maybe what state you live in. Let's just, let's just have a guess nationwide [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6425.54s)]
*  and see if there's a chart, see if there's a statistic. Let's guess what percentage of people [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6430.820000000001s)]
*  eat healthy, take vitamins, and exercise regularly. I say 10%. What do you think? [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6437.7s)]
*  Yeah, it could be cause you still have your teenagers and your young college students that [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6445.78s)]
*  are in sports and things like that. A lot of older people are more. Yeah. But a lot of people, [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6449.86s)]
*  like, you know, even though they have a hard job, they still realize like, I gotta go to the gym [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6454.74s)]
*  before work and just, just get it in. Cause if I don't, I won't have any energy. I'm better off [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6458.9s)]
*  this way. I know it sucks, but just do it. There's like people in it that have enough discipline to [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6462.82s)]
*  do that. So I would give it, I think it's one out of 10. That's what I think. What do we got, Jamie? [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6466.34s)]
*  This is impossible. Yeah, it's a little impossible. What about AI run that shit through chat? [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6472.42s)]
*  How are you going to get the answers? My point, not like, let's see what chat Americans [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6479.46s)]
*  work out. Honestly answer the question in a poll that they're, you know, well, let's ask chat GP, [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6484.26s)]
*  just for a good, I just, my point is chat GPT has to find the answer somewhere. Right. But let's see [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6489.46s)]
*  what she says. Well, okay. Hold on. Let's just for funsies. Let's just say, I know right out of the [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6494.34s)]
*  gate, the answer is that 86% people take vitamins and supplements, which is four and five American [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6499.14s)]
*  adults. Is that real? That's good. If that's true. That's really good. I wouldn't think that's true [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6503.9400000000005s)]
*  though. I don't buy that. That's what I'm trying to say. Yeah. I don't buy that. That's, that's [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6508.58s)]
*  written by a supplement company. Yeah. And what supplements and how, you know, sometimes you can [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6511.62s)]
*  overdo, you do a hair mineral analysis on people and sometimes you find things that are, you know, [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6516.34s)]
*  pretty shocking in terms of that came from supplements, you know, you, you can overdo it [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6520.82s)]
*  with even selenium. Sure. You can end up with big problems. So there's also a problem with cross [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6525.86s)]
*  contamination. Um, we, one of the things that we found out when we were selling alpha brain [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6530.74s)]
*  is that, uh, in the beginning, when we would hire a lab to, um, make the formula for us, like, so [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6535.62s)]
*  you have like a list of ingredients and then they put together this thing, which is a new tropic [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6543.219999999999s)]
*  we'd find stuff in there that we didn't have in there and it was from their bins. So they didn't [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6548.5s)]
*  clean their bins. So it's like, why is vitamin B 12 in this? Like, why is this in that? Why is that? [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6553.0599999999995s)]
*  And it's just because that's the same factor, manufacturing place where they make all kinds [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6557.7s)]
*  of stuff, creatine and all kinds of stuff. It doesn't say how I got the answer, but it says less than 10%. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6563.46s)]
*  Okay. Likely less than 10%. Okay. If you're talking about people consistently do all three, [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6567.62s)]
*  it drops significantly less than 10%, maybe even closer to three to 5%, depending on how strict your [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6571.78s)]
*  definition of healthy is. Yeah. That's what I was, that was a good guess. We're talking about adults [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6577.3s)]
*  here, presumably, but you know, one of the facts is that the foundation that your immune system is, [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6584.1s)]
*  is created and developed in is probably if not as more important than that. And that is being born [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6591.46s)]
*  the vaginal birth versus the C-section, not putting down people who've had C-section. I'm just saying [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6600.74s)]
*  the science shows that there is a distinct difference in C-section babies, immune systems [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6606.66s)]
*  versus non-C-section. There's a distinct difference in breastfed babies versus non-breastfed. And then [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6613.3s)]
*  there's a distinct difference in babies whose mothers have a healthy diet and breastfeed versus [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6618.179999999999s)]
*  mothers who don't have a healthy diet and breastfeed. So that foundation actually makes your gut grow [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6621.86s)]
*  normally, which is a large part of your immune system. It colonizes your gut because the bacteria [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6627.3s)]
*  from your mother's gut goes into your gut, goes in from her gut through her lymph system into her [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6632.02s)]
*  breast and then to your gut. And so all that foundational stuff is something not to be ignored [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6636.900000000001s)]
*  because it's going to make you deal with diseases better. And if you have to get vaccinated, it's [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6641.860000000001s)]
*  going to make you deal with vaccines better, even as a child. Not that I'm in favor of that, [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6645.9400000000005s)]
*  but I'm just saying if you want to set things up as, you know, solidly as possible to be able to [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6650.02s)]
*  take that insult, the problem is we don't know 20, 30, 40 years later what the associations are [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6654.5s)]
*  between, you know, bone diseases, skin diseases, cancers, autoimmune diseases. We have some clues. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6659.78s)]
*  I have some clues that nobody wants to look at, but we've got this long-term problem that nobody [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6665.0599999999995s)]
*  looks at. Long-term effects of lifestyle, of vaccination, of even SV40. There was one study [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6669.86s)]
*  that started tracking a thousand SV40 people that they knew were infected with SV40 looking [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6677.78s)]
*  for diseases later in life and they stopped it after 19 years, again, axed when they still had [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6683.38s)]
*  over 700 people left in the study because they said too much time had gone by. Well, the fact of [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6689.38s)]
*  the matter is that's when the study should have started 17 to 20 years later is when they should [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6693.78s)]
*  have started looking at that point, not one year, two years, but you know, most vaccine trials and [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6698.02s)]
*  drug trials, they don't, they don't, vaccine trials, it's like two weeks is almost a miracle [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6703.86s)]
*  for someone to follow out that long. Forget about looking months or years later. Doesn't happen. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6708.1s)]
*  When you first decided to write this book, how much apprehension did you have? [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6712.9s)]
*  Zero. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6719.0599999999995s)]
*  Zero. You were just fully convicted to get this idea out. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6719.86s)]
*  Well, you know, it was a bit of a process if you want to know it. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6723.54s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6726.58s)]
*  Yeah. So what first happened is that I kept getting challenged while I was, [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6727.219999999999s)]
*  I stayed on for two years as a nephrologist in my hospital. So I wasn't kicked out. I left because [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6731.78s)]
*  like my soul just couldn't hang out there anymore. And so during that time, even though I was kind [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6736.42s)]
*  of ostracized behind my back, everybody still respected me as a nephrologist, but I still had [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6742.82s)]
*  to go. And in that, in that time, I started doing public appearances. Like I went on the Gary Knoll [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6747.299999999999s)]
*  show and started doing things like that, just talking about smallpox and polio, because those [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6752.42s)]
*  were my focus because everyone's saying, what about smallpox? What about polio? And then when [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6756.82s)]
*  I started finding out, I just, I became obsessed with it. It was so interesting. So I was morbidly [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6760.0199999999995s)]
*  fascinated by the whole thing and about how everything I found was absolutely contrary [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6765.219999999999s)]
*  to what the mainstream dogma is. And what I had was a mountain that, you know, [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6770.5s)]
*  pile high to the ceiling and they had sound bites. They had nothing to fight back with me on, [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6774.9s)]
*  nothing. So this guy named Roman Bistrianich heard me on the radio show and he rung my office. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6779.62s)]
*  And after his third call, I was like, I guess I better call this guy back. And he had this idea [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6787.94s)]
*  for a book and he had done all the charts and the graphics and started writing the narrative around [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6793.38s)]
*  that of what the historical documents showed. And then I came in as kind of the medical person [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6798.98s)]
*  that was obsessed with polio and smallpox and happened to know quite a bit about pertussis. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6803.459999999999s)]
*  So we started writing the book together and there's probably about, there's gotta be, [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6807.94s)]
*  if you were to take a full-time job, 20 years, at least 20 years, but for me it was condensed [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6811.94s)]
*  because I became obsessed after I quit my job. All I did, I basically had no money. I lived in a tent [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6816.58s)]
*  with a pop-up camper. That was my office. And I was like crazy Ted Kaczynski obsessed with polio, [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6821.78s)]
*  my tent. And so no, I didn't have apprehension. I was like this information, it's been so, [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6827.62s)]
*  the US polio surveillance unit charts were supposed to be available in libraries. Lo and [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6834.58s)]
*  behold, every library I went to to find them, I was told they're not here. There's only one library, [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6840.82s)]
*  the AMA library, and you have to have special high security clearance to look at them. Well, [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6845.139999999999s)]
*  I won't say how, but I got ahold of them. And what those documents show is that it wasn't just [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6849.46s)]
*  cutter laboratories that had a problem with live polio. It wasn't just why if all the vaccine, [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6855.14s)]
*  we didn't talk about this, but all the vaccine companies had a problem with live virus in their [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6860.660000000001s)]
*  injectable vaccines during Salk's year. So 1954 and 1955 up to 1959, they all were producing vaccine [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6865.38s)]
*  with live virus in it because Salk wouldn't listen to the scientists abroad who were saying his [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6873.14s)]
*  inactivation curve was where the sun doesn't shine. So that beginning of that and just tracking [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6877.22s)]
*  all that down and tracking, asking the questions that you asked, well, where did polio go? What was [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6884.98s)]
*  really causing the paralysis? Why don't we see it today? I had to answer all those questions and [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6889.62s)]
*  every question I answered, it was so satisfying that I just wanted to go on to the next question. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6893.78s)]
*  And so there was never any hesitation because I just actually, I was so single-minded that I [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6899.219999999999s)]
*  didn't think about the threats that could happen as a result of that. And it wasn't until after the [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6904.419999999999s)]
*  book was out that the threats happened and I'm still here. And look, I figure if anybody wants [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6910.74s)]
*  to do me in now, the timing is really bad because this is pretty much out there now. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6916.34s)]
*  Marc Thiessen It's been out there for a while. The Jonas Salk thing was also wild. I thought Jonas [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6920.26s)]
*  Salk was this genius that created this incredible virus to save humanity. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6926.26s)]
*  Danielle Pletka Yeah, so did I. So many of our childhood [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6929.62s)]
*  fables turn out not to be true, but that was a big one. And it's still hard for a lot of people to [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6934.5s)]
*  believe, but I just think it's like anything. Like if you're open to different information, [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6940.42s)]
*  and I always say, look, I can make mistakes. I'm not infallible. Someone has actually found a [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6946.02s)]
*  mistake in the book. I actually went in and corrected it. That's the difference between me [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6952.74s)]
*  and these other people is that if I made a mistake, I want to know about it and I will go and make it [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6955.7s)]
*  right and I will publicly admit that I made a mistake. But I will say that 99.9% of what's in [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6959.9400000000005s)]
*  this book is true, factual, and provable. And because I've done the research, but it's a hard [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6964.74s)]
*  thing to do. What doctor is going to quit their job? I was lucky. I didn't have kids. I didn't have [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6971.3s)]
*  medical royalty ancestors who would have been disappointed in me. I came from nothing. I wasn't [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6976.66s)]
*  afraid to go back to nothing. And so that's why I was willing to live in a tent until this thing was [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6980.98s)]
*  done and published in 2013. Marc Thiessen [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6985.219999999999s)]
*  How long did it take you? Danielle Pletka [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6990.0199999999995s)]
*  I started working on it. Roman had been working on it for years. He had been going to libraries [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6991.86s)]
*  because his kids got hit hard by an ex-wife who jabbed them. He didn't know about it and they got [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=6996.259999999999s)]
*  really sick. And then he started looking at old graphs and going, oh, that doesn't make sense. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7002.42s)]
*  So he got obsessed in his own way with the numbers. He's the numbers guy. And so he'd been working [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7006.66s)]
*  on it. And then the two of us together worked on it probably from 2009 to 2013. And then it was [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7012.74s)]
*  published in 2013. We couldn't find a publisher. Even the alternative publishers didn't want [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7020.5s)]
*  anything to do with it. So we self-published. And then after it was successful, guess who wanted to [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7025.54s)]
*  publish our book? And I was like, nope, sorry. We're going to carry on the way we are. Oh, [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7029.78s)]
*  but you're going to get such more credibility. It's like unlikely. We did okay. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7034.42s)]
*  Marc Thiessen If you give us money, you'll get credibility. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7039.3s)]
*  Danielle Pletka If you give us most of your profits. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7040.9s)]
*  Marc Thiessen Let us take a part of your successful business that you worked on [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7042.1s)]
*  for five years or four years. Danielle Pletka [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7044.66s)]
*  We'll give you $1 a book. Marc Thiessen [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7046.34s)]
*  That would be sweet. What a great deal. And then I'll have a prestige behind my name. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7048.34s)]
*  Danielle Pletka Yeah. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7053.06s)]
*  Marc Thiessen Yeah, I've been published by a real company. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7053.46s)]
*  When was the last time you looked at a book and said, let me check who published this? [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7056.1s)]
*  Danielle Pletka Exactly. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7059.46s)]
*  Marc Thiessen Maybe make sure somebody recommended this book. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7060.42s)]
*  Danielle Pletka Self-published. It's all lies. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7063.14s)]
*  Marc Thiessen I have never heard of this publisher. This is outrageous. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7064.02s)]
*  Danielle Pletka What's that there? Forbidden Science? [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7068.42s)]
*  Marc Thiessen Jacques VallÃ©e. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7070.02s)]
*  Danielle Pletka Okay. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7070.9800000000005s)]
*  Marc Thiessen Jacques VallÃ©e is probably the most interesting [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7071.7s)]
*  UFO researcher that I've ever talked to. He's the guy that was, you remember the French scientist, [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7076.419999999999s)]
*  you remember Close Encounters of the Third Kind? Did you see that movie? [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7081.219999999999s)]
*  Danielle Pletka Long time ago. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7083.46s)]
*  Marc Thiessen Long time ago. Do you remember there's a French [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7084.339999999999s)]
*  scientist on the ground coordinating with the army and explaining to everybody what's going on? [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7085.94s)]
*  Danielle Pletka Okay. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7090.58s)]
*  Marc Thiessen That French scientist is modeled after this guy. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7090.98s)]
*  This guy's been following UFOs since like the 50s or the 60s? Did you say the 50s? [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7093.379999999999s)]
*  Marc Thiessen Like, a long time. He's an older gentleman, [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7098.74s)]
*  but he's fascinating. And he's very rational. When he talks about it, it's like he is very [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7103.06s)]
*  objective in what's nonsense and what's true and what we can't explain. It's a fascinating subject. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7110.9800000000005s)]
*  Danielle Pletka I think similar threads would run through his experience, definitely. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7116.580000000001s)]
*  Marc Thiessen Oh, I'm sure. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7120.1s)]
*  Danielle Pletka Forbidden Science. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7120.9800000000005s)]
*  Marc Thiessen Yeah. Well, for the longest time, it was a ridiculed subject. It didn't have the same [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7121.780000000001s)]
*  societal impact as being a vaccine skeptic or an anti-vaxxer. With that pejorative, they've done an [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7130.02s)]
*  incredible job of scaring people into just falling in line. Because if you question it and someone [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7138.5s)]
*  said, oh, did you know he's an anti-vaxxer? Danielle Pletka [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7144.02s)]
*  That's enough. That's it. Marc Thiessen [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7146.580000000001s)]
*  That's all you need to hear. And you're going to get that after this podcast. And I've already [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7147.38s)]
*  gotten it. Danielle Pletka [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7151.14s)]
*  You're going to get it big time. Marc Thiessen [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7151.22s)]
*  I've gotten it already. Danielle Pletka [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7152.5s)]
*  They'll start picking apart my facts and they'll want to come on and dismantle. This is what always [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7154.660000000001s)]
*  happens. I come in first. I tell my story and then they bring in the experts who are able to take, [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7158.66s)]
*  without me being in the room, of course, because I can't be able to defend myself, [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7163.78s)]
*  and then let the public believe that everything I said was just one big sack of lies. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7167.22s)]
*  Marc Thiessen Well, they'll definitely be the usual suspects that will be doing that. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7170.58s)]
*  But has anyone ever tried to sit down with you and have a conversation publicly about this? [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7174.18s)]
*  And refute it? Danielle Pletka [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7180.98s)]
*  Not that I can recall. Marc Thiessen [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7183.54s)]
*  No one's offered? Danielle Pletka [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7185.22s)]
*  Yeah, I have to say I'm not that interested in doing that because I just feel like, [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7186.9s)]
*  you know, debate is, it's an actual skill to be a debater. People, people study debate and people [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7192.58s)]
*  get really good at it. And I'm not a debater. Like I've put, if somebody wanted to debate me in writing, [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7199.0599999999995s)]
*  I would be happy to do that because then I could sit there and take my time, you know, go through [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7204.0199999999995s)]
*  the references that I needed rather than having to, you know, Marc Thiessen [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7208.42s)]
*  Right. That makes sense. Like a sub stack. Danielle Pletka [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7211.0599999999995s)]

*  Marc Thiessen Right. And there's an anxiety aspect to that. And like, you know, there's a lot of [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7216.0199999999995s)]
*  adrenaline and emotions. And yeah, it's a skill. Danielle Pletka [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7220.5s)]
*  But I would do it only if we had a topic that was, you know, basically agreed upon beforehand that [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7223.94s)]
*  we could both upskill on and use what we know as as that debate point. But it usually just becomes [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7229.38s)]
*  character assassination. Marc Thiessen [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7233.94s)]
*  It does. It does. It's super unfortunate. And it's really transparent when it's about a serious [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7235.46s)]
*  subject. Like, why do you have to attack someone's who they are, make it ridicule them instead of [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7240.5s)]
*  just refuting the facts or laying out your case? It just doesn't make sense that anybody who's [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7247.54s)]
*  right would do that. That's not what you do when you're right. That's what you do when you're [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7253.86s)]
*  trying to ridicule people. And you usually try to ridicule people because you need an edge. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7257.06s)]
*  You know, it's like a bully. They're like, if you see fighters, like a UFC fighter in his prime, [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7261.06s)]
*  like Anderson Silva was one of the greatest of all time, if someone like got in his face and [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7269.86s)]
*  tried to intimidate him, it would be kind of hilarious, because he was the best fighter in [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7274.339999999999s)]
*  the world. So he wouldn't even have to do it back. He could just smile at you. And that's sort of the [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7278.0199999999995s)]
*  same here. When you're ridiculing someone, like right off the bat, a bunch of, you know, ad hominems [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7282.82s)]
*  about that person, you're trying to diminish that person to set up your argument as being superior, [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7290.42s)]
*  because you're the superior intellect. And you're doing that because you don't feel like you're on [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7294.74s)]
*  level playing field. And so you want to try to do something to push them off, make fun of them in [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7298.26s)]
*  some sort of way, instead of just like laying out your version of what reality is, lay out your [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7302.74s)]
*  version if you're so strong. If you're so correct, it should be super easy to do. Well, just like in [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7307.780000000001s)]
*  sports, it's the same here. It's like cheating is for losers. You know, if you're a winner, you're [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7313.3s)]
*  not, you don't have to cheat. And, and that's the same with them. Like if their product is so [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7316.66s)]
*  wonderful that everybody needs it so badly, then why is there such, what they say is that we're too [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7320.66s)]
*  stupid to understand how they're saving our lives and how they pro- this is one of the big arguments [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7325.54s)]
*  that we really ought to touch on, is that they say that our lifespan has improved as a result [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7329.62s)]
*  of medical interventions. When what we show in here, what other scientists have shown is that [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7334.0199999999995s)]
*  it's about 3.5% of the contribution from medicine goes into our exp- extended lifespan, 3.5% [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7340.0199999999995s)]
*  based on antibiotics, vaccines, et cetera. The rest of it was all about the revolution, [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7350.5s)]
*  the health revolution, the clean water, the shelter, the electricity, the child labor laws, [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7354.900000000001s)]
*  you know, ending. So, you know, the magic of medicine is not what people think. And it really [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7359.860000000001s)]
*  traps, it really traps a lot of people. Like I, I think there's a value to, to the medical field [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7364.9800000000005s)]
*  in terms of surgery and certain drugs. And if you have an organ failure, like absolutely, but why not? [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7370.18s)]
*  Like my Hippocratic oath said that I should consult, you know, any consultant that will help [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7376.1s)]
*  my patient and keep the well-being of my patient stable. Well, to me, that includes, you know, [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7380.9800000000005s)]
*  using every therapy that is as, as the most benign therapies possible first, the ones that work along [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7385.860000000001s)]
*  with the blueprint of a human body that go along with the, the, the theory of health rather than [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7392.42s)]
*  pounding down disease, you're always going to get a better result that way, assuming you've got time [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7397.54s)]
*  and, you know, you haven't waited till the last minute. We certainly will get a better result if [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7402.02s)]
*  you do get the disease that way. Like the idea that you could just ignore everything, but a [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7405.62s)]
*  medication is so silly. And it doesn't, the only reason why you would do that is if that's the only [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7410.42s)]
*  way you made your money. And that's really, especially if you're in the vaccine business and [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7415.54s)]
*  you're, you have an enormous ad budget and you're sponsoring all the television networks. Well, [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7421.38s)]
*  that's the big thing. And the other thing is people trust what they see on the television, [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7427.54s)]
*  you know, CNN, I, CNN was my go-to thing for the longest time. Yeah. And now I look at it and I [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7430.98s)]
*  think, oh my goodness, you know, what cracked it for me is when, when they, when they publicly [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7437.0599999999995s)]
*  villainized Andy Wakefield. And I actually knew the story behind Andy Wakefield at the time. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7442.82s)]
*  What was that story? The story behind him is that, you know, he was, he was the doctor you'll hear. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7446.98s)]
*  He was publicly shamed. His license was removed. He, he published an article about what, what he [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7452.179999999999s)]
*  called toxic nodular enterocolitis in children with autism. He was a gastroenterologist, [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7457.62s)]
*  a very high level, very well-respected, decorated gastroenterologist. And he published this paper, [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7462.98s)]
*  which remained in the journal for 12 years. And all it said at the end was further research needs [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7468.18s)]
*  to be done in order to see if there is any real connection between the MMR vaccine, autism and [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7472.9s)]
*  toxic nodular enterocolitis. These kids suffer with horrible bowel disease. It's not just brain [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7479.3s)]
*  disease. And so after he was about to publish another paper showing that in this certain type [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7483.94s)]
*  of monkeys that were vaccinated against hepatitis B lost a lot of their reflexes and had problems. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7489.54s)]
*  And it was on the eve of the publication of that paper that his original paper was revoked. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7494.66s)]
*  And ever since then, he has been the poster child for vaccine nonsense, for anti-vax, crazy people. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7499.299999999999s)]
*  And in fact, every time I've done anything, his name, funny that I brought his name up. I love him. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7506.419999999999s)]
*  He's a great guy, but his name would always come up. Well, you're a friend of Andy Wakefield, [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7510.74s)]
*  or Andy Wakefield because autism and vaccines has been debunked because Andy Wakefield lied. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7515.219999999999s)]
*  And he didn't lie. All he said is I did biopsies. I saw this and this is possibly a connection. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7521.7s)]
*  And since then, other scientists have come in, done the same thing, biopsies. Then they looked [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7527.219999999999s)]
*  at whether the vaccine virus was in that biopsy. And it was, it wasn't a wild virus, was the vaccine [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7532.5s)]
*  virus in that area, not the surrounding area. So there is a relationship between gut disease, [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7537.38s)]
*  MMR vaccine, retained virus that hasn't been processed properly because it didn't come into [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7542.9800000000005s)]
*  your body properly and disease, brain disease. So that's a fact. But CNN did a hit job on Andy [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7548.5s)]
*  Wakefield. And I remember going, huh, well, what's going on here? Because I know what happened with [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7554.58s)]
*  that whole situation. Now, CNN is saying this, and that was kind of when the windscreen cracked for [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7561.38s)]
*  me and I just had to start questioning anything. And then you've got, you know, the doctors that [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7565.94s)]
*  go on there. There are a couple of doctors. I think you interviewed one of them, didn't you? [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7570.099999999999s)]
*  Sanjay Gupta. Yeah. Yeah. There was a guy before him. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7573.379999999999s)]
*  And some of the stuff he said was pretty unbelievable. That's what the public is going [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7578.98s)]
*  to hear. You know, your best chances of dealing with this is to just get the vaccine. You don't [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7582.0199999999995s)]
*  want to get shingles, get that vaccine. Nevermind the whole other truth around that, because like [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7585.219999999999s)]
*  you say, it's the advertisers, but it's bigger than that. Does the shingles vaccine work? [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7590.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, what do you think about giving yourself a vaccine for something you already have? [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7593.7s)]
*  Like you think about it, like chickenpox is a disease that we all got as kids. You got it [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7600.26s)]
*  as a kid, probably. You're kind of superhuman though. You didn't get COVID. I got it eventually. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7604.42s)]
*  You did. So I got it eventually. You got it eventually. It broke you down. But I got [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7609.86s)]
*  chickenpox really bad. And then I got chickenpox when I was a kid. Yeah. There you go. So [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7615.38s)]
*  back in the old days, we would all get chickenpox and then we'd be exposed to other kids that had [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7620.0199999999995s)]
*  chickenpox. We'd go over kids' houses if they had chickenpox. Yeah. People do. They still do that. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7623.46s)]
*  I didn't have to. I got it somehow. I don't know how I got it, probably from my brother. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7628.42s)]
*  And so you have this dormant, this virus lays dormant in your body until your immune system [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7632.66s)]
*  breaks down. So, but part of it is not just your immune system breakdown. It's the fact that all [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7638.5s)]
*  these kids are now vaccinated and the circulation of the disease. See, some vaccines work in terms [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7643.3s)]
*  of they stop the circulation of the disease, but add a detriment to us. So it's been a detriment [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7649.22s)]
*  for measles and it's been a detriment for chickenpox. So chickenpox, we used to get [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7654.42s)]
*  continuous. You didn't have, adults didn't get shingles. It was very rare for adults to get [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7657.780000000001s)]
*  shingles before the chickenpox vaccine came out. Extremely rare. But since then, the rate of shingles [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7661.780000000001s)]
*  in adults and children has skyrocketed because we're no longer getting our boosters being exposed [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7666.66s)]
*  to the circulating microbes. So now the solution to that is to give adults like four times the [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7671.22s)]
*  dose of the childhood chickenpox in an injectable vaccine against something that they already have. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7678.66s)]
*  And so the theory is that you're going to ramp up your antibodies and then you're going to be able [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7683.62s)]
*  to do battle if your, if your viruses come out again. The only problem with that is that the [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7687.54s)]
*  problem is, is the immune system. If you get AIDS or you're on chemotherapy, your chances of that [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7692.74s)]
*  happening are really high. And yeah, does the vaccine work or not? I don't know, but I just [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7696.66s)]
*  don't think it's just to me, just a completely strange concept to inject myself with something [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7702.66s)]
*  that I already have, along with all the other excipients and compounds that go in a vaccine [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7707.22s)]
*  that nobody wants to talk about either. So can you explain how a vaccine is manufactured? Like, [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7711.46s)]
*  how could they not know all the different stuff that's in it? Like, let's, let's, [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7717.22s)]
*  let's talk about like how the SV 40 got in there. So to, you need something alive. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7723.62s)]
*  You need some sort of, some sort of tissue from a living creature in order to grow these things. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7731.780000000001s)]
*  Well, in terms of the COVID vaccine, you just needed to pile crap actually, because it's made [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7736.34s)]
*  on E. coli cells and that's where you find E. coli. So with a lot of the other vaccines, [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7740.58s)]
*  you do need living, like for, for tetanus, you need rotten meat. Okay. That's how the tetanus [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7745.62s)]
*  vaccine is made with rotten meat. You were talking about tetanus earlier and you kind of glossed [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7751.22s)]
*  over it, but you didn't finish up. You were saying that, that, that tetanus itself, you started like [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7755.46s)]
*  Googling and like reading about tetanus itself. Yeah. Yeah. Big wake up call with tetanus. So, [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7760.58s)]
*  you know, what we see if, if anyone's worried about tetanus, what we're shown is a picture of [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7766.98s)]
*  a soldier from like the 1800s with his, but he's naked and his back is arched. If you just Google [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7771.7s)]
*  tetanus right now and you look for images, you'll get this image. And so that's what we're told will [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7776.98s)]
*  happen. If we get tetanus, it's a sure thing. You're just going to get tetanus and you're going to die. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7782.5s)]
*  Well, the fact of the matter is that when I started doing my deep dive in world war one, [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7786.34s)]
*  look, it was fought in the trenches with horses. That's where you get tetanus from ruminant animals, [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7791.06s)]
*  lives in their gut. Then it goes in the soil and it's just a spore. Doesn't do anything until it [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7794.5s)]
*  gets into an area that doesn't have oxygen. So you get a cut, you get a surgeon to close you up real [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7799.38s)]
*  nice without cleaning it out properly. And you're a setup for tetanus, which will transform from a [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7805.22s)]
*  spore to a different kind of a microbe and start releasing a toxin that can, it first starts as [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7810.02s)]
*  numb numbness, usually in that limb. The extreme case is in that soldier who would have been [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7815.94s)]
*  malnourished, stressed out, probably vaccinated for smallpox before he hit the fields and exposed [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7822.66s)]
*  to enormous amounts of tetanus, possibly gunshot wound or a slice somewhere and then sewn up. So [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7828.98s)]
*  yeah, his nervous system could have had a real big dose of toxin and nobody did anything about it. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7834.74s)]
*  That's the worst case scenario. You don't want that to happen. But today, I've treated tetanus. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7839.86s)]
*  Let's just put it that way. I've treated several cases of tetanus. Some, one of the cases was a [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7845.3s)]
*  neurologically diagnosed tetanus. So tetanus is treatable. You can get on it early. Rabbit [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7849.22s)]
*  rabbit studies have shown that if you give vitamin C, if you have a good high vitamin C level before [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7854.18s)]
*  you put glass with tetanus spores on it inside the skin of a rabbit, that you can prevent the [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7858.74s)]
*  tetanus from happening. Even if you give the vitamin C at the time of the injury, you can [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7864.900000000001s)]
*  prevent it from happening. If you give it after the event, the death rate goes down to, you know, [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7868.18s)]
*  very, very low, if not zero. So vitamin C is a main factor. But the biggest factor is cleaning [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7872.66s)]
*  a wound and keeping the wound open if you think it's a dirty wound and not to close it straight [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7878.34s)]
*  up, which is why nails, you say stepping on a nail is the classic because rust can kind of hold [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7883.3s)]
*  the old spores inside of it. You step on the nail, you get inoculated, and then you wait for it to [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7888.34s)]
*  heal over. You have to open that wound if that's going to happen. But you know, but tetanus has [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7893.86s)]
*  been there. There's a whole series of reports on instances where the cotton that was made for [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7898.9s)]
*  menstrual pads for women postpartum was impregnated with tetanus, and they got horrible cases of [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7906.58s)]
*  tetanus just from using those menstrual pads. So the hospital systems have also been, you know, [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7911.62s)]
*  responsible. The biggest thing is that being vaccinated for tetanus is not necessarily [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7916.9s)]
*  security against not getting tetanus. Now, am I telling people not to go get vaccinated or not? [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7921.94s)]
*  No, I'm not. I'm just saying there's so much, like every vaccine, there's so much more to the [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7926.26s)]
*  story that should be considered. You can have different strains of tetanus, and if you're living [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7930.42s)]
*  on a field that has rumen animals, you will be, whether you like it or not, you're going to be [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7934.9800000000005s)]
*  eating whatever's down in that field, and you're going to be inoculated and have antibody and [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7939.06s)]
*  probably cell-mediated immunity against it. So you'll already have some immunity to that. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7943.860000000001s)]
*  So worst case scenarios, you have no immunity, you go get a dirty wound, and you don't get any [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7949.22s)]
*  real competent medical care for it. Yeah, you can end up getting, having a problem with tetanus, [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7953.22s)]
*  whether you're not going to have locked jaw and an arched back and die, unlikely today for that [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7959.38s)]
*  to happen. But most tetanus that happens is delayed onset. So the earlier your symptoms come on, [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7964.5s)]
*  the worse the tetanus is going to be. If it comes on later, generally, the better you're going to do. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7971.9400000000005s)]
*  Treated with high doses of magnesium, high doses of vitamin C, local wound care, that's the best [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7977.38s)]
*  thing that you can do. Up to you if you want to go get jabbed for tetanus after you learn everything [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7982.1s)]
*  about it. Everything's on my Odyssey channel, by the way, that's where, because I got cancelled out [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7986.42s)]
*  of YouTube for talking about vitamin C for all of all things. So everything's now on Odyssey, [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7991.3s)]
*  all my videos are on Odyssey, and I do one that's just on tetanus. And again, medical reference after [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=7997.14s)]
*  medical reference, I don't make this stuff up, I just report what I read. Yeah. It's crazy that [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8001.700000000001s)]
*  they just kick you off YouTube for reporting studies. Yep. Yeah, you can have like pornography [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8006.58s)]
*  and murder and all kinds of other stuff on there. It's pretty horrifying some of the things that [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8012.34s)]
*  flash across like I wish I can't unsee that now. Have you ever posted your stuff on X? [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8016.26s)]
*  Yes, lots of stuff on X. Yeah. So most of this stuff is available there? Well, I got cancelled [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8021.38s)]
*  out of Twitter when it was Twitter and I could not make another account. It's like they knew where [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8026.5s)]
*  I was. They were able, even when I was using different phone numbers and different emails, [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8030.74s)]
*  I could not restore an account. They got your IP. Yeah. Maybe that's what I used. I used VPN as [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8034.26s)]
*  well. Couldn't do it. Really? Then I would get an account set up and then they would say you [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8039.7s)]
*  went against standards and cancel it. So anyway, they must have put a cookie on your phone or [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8044.1s)]
*  something. Maybe. Did you try a new phone? I tried a computer too. Wow. But I did finally get an [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8048.18s)]
*  account. I was able to open an account and get a blue check mark, but I've only got, look, I don't [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8054.66s)]
*  have that many followers. I mean, I went from having over 95,000 to having nothing and now [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8058.26s)]
*  they love that. They love to let us build ourselves up and chop us down and make us rebuild. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8063.9400000000005s)]
*  What is your account? We'll help you out. It's Dr. Suzanne H7. Yeah. And I don't post my opinions [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8067.62s)]
*  about different things in the world or dog and cat pictures. I post stuff about vaccines. I stay in [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8079.14s)]
*  lane as best as I can. So for you, was the COVID pandemic, was that like a big wake up call for [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8085.14s)]
*  people to start reading your book? We've had pretty good sales. Like Roman keeps, because he does all [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8096.18s)]
*  the accounting and he says, we just have a good amount of steady sales and once in a while we'll [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8103.780000000001s)]
*  see. Like every time you mentioned the book, we had a little blip on it. During COVID, every time [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8107.780000000001s)]
*  Bill Gates comes out and says something stupid, we have a big surge in our sales. So they actually [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8112.26s)]
*  help us when they see us with their, you know, we're going to, if we vaccinated enough people, [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8116.1s)]
*  we can help depopulate. It's like, okay. And for whatever reason, our book sales go up. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8120.5s)]
*  When he starts talking about vaccine deniers and vaccine skeptics, whenever they started doing that [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8125.780000000001s)]
*  and the way the language that they would use was like when the president was saying, our patience [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8132.1s)]
*  is wearing thin, we've been patient with you, but our patience is wearing thin. And the White House [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8136.66s)]
*  prints this thing that if you're vaccinated, you did your job. But for those unvaccinated, [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8141.86s)]
*  you're looking forward to a, what did they say? A winter of? Oh, a dark winter. Yeah. Of death and [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8146.5s)]
*  disease. Like what? You know, dark winter was a tabletop exercise. Do you know about tabletop [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8152.9s)]
*  exercises? I do, but what is dark winter? So dark winter was one. You can explain tabletop exercises. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8158.58s)]
*  That involves smallpox. Well, there are lots of them, but Johns Hopkins does, I have a whole [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8163.299999999999s)]
*  PowerPoint on this too, but Johns Hopkins conducts a lot of them. They involve fictional scenarios [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8167.94s)]
*  where there could be pandemics and terroristic depositions of toxins and chemicals and microbes [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8176.66s)]
*  that were manipulated in a lab. And then who in our society is going to respond and how they're [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8183.86s)]
*  going to respond, like the CDC and DARPA and the news outlets are always utmost importance as the [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8189.86s)]
*  news outlets and the messaging that goes to the news outlets and these tabletop exercises. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8196.1s)]
*  But dark winter was one that was a tabletop exercise after the World Trade Center is thing. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8200.42s)]
*  When we were pointing our fingers at Iraq and weapons of mass destruction and a Russian scientist [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8205.78s)]
*  that, you know, had weaponized smallpox and brought it to Iraq, which they never found by the way. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8210.5s)]
*  But because of that, that's why I was asked to get vaccinated for smallpox in 2003 was that dark [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8216.1s)]
*  winter, whole, that dark winter thing that was going on. Thank God there were a few people in [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8220.74s)]
*  the CDC and consultants, old guys, the old guys with integrity that like knew the deal from the [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8224.58s)]
*  old days who were saying, wait a minute, smallpox is not easily transmitted. So that's a no-no. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8229.14s)]
*  So even if there is a terroristic smallpox drop, it's not going to be easily transmitted. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8234.82s)]
*  It's treatable and the vaccine doesn't necessarily prevent it. And so that was kind of one of the [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8240.42s)]
*  things that stalled it all out. But then they did the study on the Marines because the part of the [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8246.98s)]
*  exercises are we must do tests for the new vaccine. They use the old vaccine, the drybacks. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8251.7s)]
*  There were lots of problems with those military people. And then I was asked to sign a 63 page [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8257.460000000001s)]
*  informed consent, basically saying that I understood all the problems that could happen to me, [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8265.7s)]
*  that I didn't have little kids in my life, that I wasn't going to be able to spread it. I would [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8270.26s)]
*  isolate after I got the vaccine. So they were ultra careful about this one because they knew [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8273.460000000001s)]
*  they were dealing with something that could get a very bad reputation. The reason they ultimately [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8278.34s)]
*  canceled it is because any doubts, whether or not well-funded, must not be allowed to exist. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8283.62s)]
*  Because if we were saying, oh my gosh, we have this terrible smallpox vaccine, how did they do [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8288.26s)]
*  it back then? We have the same vaccine and people are getting really sick and dying and having [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8292.26s)]
*  cardiomyopathies. That's a problem. And so that's why the truth gets locked down over COVID. We know, [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8295.94s)]
*  look, you've seen the athletes dropping dead. You know about the cardiomyopathies and the [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8301.78s)]
*  pulmonary emboli and all that kind of thing. Nobody's talking about the stem cells that the [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8305.3s)]
*  newborn babies are born without. Nobody's talking about the fact that there are now death doulas to [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8310.019999999999s)]
*  deliver dead babies. Like that wasn't even a thing before. But I've got a friend that's a midwife who [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8314.74s)]
*  tells me that they are now creating a new field, which are midwives that only deliver dead babies. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8318.98s)]
*  They do nothing else. They didn't need that before. COVID was an absolute nightmare in terms of [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8324.42s)]
*  obstetrics, gynecology, labor and delivery. A lot of midwives that got done and because they didn't [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8330.42s)]
*  get vaccinated, they don't even want to go back now that they can go back because they don't want [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8336.1s)]

*  in terms of the birth problems that are happening because of the actual vaccine itself. Look, [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8348.18s)]
*  if it causes problems and blood clots in our circulation, what do you think it's going to do [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8353.22s)]
*  to a placenta that is pretty much all blood vessel? That's all it is. It's like a big blood [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8357.3s)]
*  vessel sandwich is what it is. And there was no studies that showed that it was safe to give to [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8361.06s)]
*  pregnant women, but yet they were saying that. Well, there's look, every influenza vaccine [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8367.46s)]
*  package insert says it's never been tested for carcinogenicity or mutagenicity in pregnant women, [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8372.259999999998s)]
*  yet it's recommended every year for every pregnant woman and every time they get pregnant or not. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8377.859999999999s)]
*  It's recommended. Same with the pertussis vaccine. Give it to pregnant women, never mind that it [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8382.98s)]
*  changes the immune reactivity of the infant. Nobody talks about these things. This is what I say when [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8386.82s)]
*  it's like the truth is so much more complicated than the sound bite lie. The sound bite lie is [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8394.58s)]
*  what gets around the world three times. The science is settled. The science is settled. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8399.14s)]
*  There's no debate needed because the likes of me are so crazy and whacked out and [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8403.14s)]
*  I'm trying to destroy the good order of the general public, things like that. Blood is on your hands. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8409.06s)]
*  That's a good one. I always love that one. Yeah, it's a fun one. I like that one. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8414.98s)]
*  See if you can pull up rational wiki and Humphreys. You'll enjoy this. I want to see the image of the [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8421.78s)]
*  guy with tetanus. Did you find that? Can I just see one? I want to see what it looks like when [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8426.58s)]
*  you're locked up. It's an old painting. Well, the one I saw was like a hour long. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8432.58s)]
*  So can I ask you when you've treated people that have tetanus and didn't have the tetanus shot or [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8438.02s)]
*  did they get tetanus and they have the tetanus shot? The one that had the worst tetanus had [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8441.86s)]
*  locked on had the tetanus shot. Put in painting. Put in artwork or painting. Look at that dead guy. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8445.94s)]
*  But go up to that dead guy. Yeah, right there. That's not real? I mean, it looks real. It looks fake as [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8452.1s)]
*  shit. Does it? It does. Not to me, bro. It could be. It could be. But look, he's clearly been in [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8456.74s)]
*  the hospital for a really long time. He probably got hospital acquired tetanus. There's a bunch of kids. I don't want to put this on the screen. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8463.86s)]
*  Okay, you know, right. Now, this was an image right there. What makes you think that that's fake? [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8469.06s)]
*  It's very blurry. Yeah, that is weird. That part there looks it definitely does look fake. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8474.5s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it's probably a bunch of Nazi tattoos. But if you put in painting, painting soldier tetanus, [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8479.22s)]
*  that then it will come up. Is that it? There it is. First one right there. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8485.14s)]
*  It's very famous. That's what's on the Wikipedia page as well. So this is that you don't want that [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8488.82s)]
*  to happen. You do get tetanus and there is no antibiotics. This is surely what will happen to you. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8494.42s)]
*  Now today, how would you treat someone who got tetanus? [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8499.460000000001s)]
*  There are antibiotics, you know, that you but mostly it's supportive care until, you know, your [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8503.14s)]
*  therapy starts to work. So some people end up if it's not dealt to in time, you can end up ventilated. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8508.82s)]
*  But again, that's it's a theoretical problem. But if you get on it in time, that's not certainly not [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8514.1s)]
*  been my experience. And so the ones that I've treated that haven't been vaccinated have had [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8519.14s)]
*  the easiest mildest cases. But so your point is not done a large randomized controlled study. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8523.3s)]
*  But but what's really important here is what you're saying is that even if you get the tetanus shot, [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8529.3s)]
*  if you step on a nail, like you could still get tetanus. Look, it's one of the tetanus. In order [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8533.14s)]
*  to make tetanus immune globulin, which is another option when say you have a cut and your magic [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8538.259999999998s)]
*  tetanus shot doesn't work right away, then you can get an immune globulin injection that came from [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8543.539999999999s)]
*  somebody who has had tetanus. Usually these are people who have actually had tetanus, not who have [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8548.42s)]
*  been back. And one of the don't one of the donors that's in the literature that I use is somebody [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8554.34s)]
*  who has had natural tetanus despite having several, several vaccines. So no, the tetanus vaccine is [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8558.58s)]
*  not a guarantee against. It's like a severe tetanus. Yeah. That's right. Before you die, [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8564.58s)]
*  they call it severe. Yeah. But it could also be caused by meningitis. So this is the this is the [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8570.9s)]
*  kind of the dead baby equivalent of, you know, that they use for tetanus. So this was a soldier, [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8575.54s)]
*  I believe, during a very long time ago. And he was don't even show you his wound. He's probably [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8581.7s)]
*  stepped on something. It can happen. Not saying it can't. But again, our parents given well rounded [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8586.900000000001s)]
*  information. No, they're not. They're not told that there are actually things you can do to prevent [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8591.78s)]
*  tetanus. Shouldn't they at least be told how to clean out a wound and not to let anybody sew it [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8595.54s)]
*  up? And secondary healing is a thing. Like some people get open heart surgery. And because they [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8600.900000000001s)]
*  get infections, I've seen this happen. They just leave everything open and let it fill in on its [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8604.98s)]
*  own. You end up with a big scar, but they're still alive because the infection was able to heal from [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8609.38s)]
*  the inside out rather the wound was able to heal from the inside out. We don't want to happen as a [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8614.42s)]
*  wound to heal from the outside because then you're locking in dead tissue, which is a perfect setup. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8618.66s)]
*  Tetanus loves dead tissue, which is why they use dead rotten meat to grow the vaccine. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8623.539999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Toxoid. What is it like to have your entire view of medical history do a 180? [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8628.18s)]
*  Like what is it like to be a practicing doctor and someone who never would have imagined this [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8639.94s)]
*  until you faced these forces trying to get you to vaccinate? It's kind of exciting actually because [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8645.94s)]
*  during my medical residency, like towards the end of it, I was like, I just thought one day, [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8652.1s)]
*  I'm not a healer. I don't know how to heal anything. I'm just prolonging people's lives, [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8657.78s)]
*  treating their diseases with drugs. Like I'm a glorified pharmaceutical technician. I realized [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8662.66s)]
*  that one day and I was like, I'm not a surgeon. I can't do surgery. So I write prescriptions. I [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8666.34s)]
*  do diagnoses and I write prescriptions. So I decided to go into a field where people really [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8670.74s)]
*  needed prescriptions. Like if you don't have kidney function, you're on dialysis. Like that's [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8676.02s)]
*  one of the glories of medicine. Like you can prolong people's lives. I really enjoyed that. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8679.54s)]
*  But then after I left completely and started studying real physiology beyond what I learned [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8684.019999999999s)]
*  in medicine, like I'm learning a lot of stuff you're learning too, you know, the new tropics [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8689.06s)]
*  and all that stuff that you talk about. Well, I'm learning about that. I love it actually. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8692.66s)]
*  It's exciting. I've been liberated from a prison essentially, from a stupid prison [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8697.14s)]
*  where my brain was locked down and I was told what to do and how to do it. And then watching [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8703.06s)]
*  the results, it would be one thing if the results were good, okay, but the results aren't good. Like [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8706.9s)]
*  we treat symptoms. We treat hypertension. Hypertension is a symptom. It's not a disease. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8710.9s)]
*  Hypertension can come from lots of different things. That's just one case in point. So I really [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8715.38s)]
*  love being able to now have the freedom to look at the full human being and their physiology [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8720.82s)]
*  and look at them as an electromagnetic entity that has some chemicals and vitamins and help them [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8726.98s)]
*  direct their body back towards the blueprint that it was designed upon. And that's to me what real [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8733.619999999999s)]
*  healing and real medicine is about. It's not about being anti-antibiotic, anti-this, anti-that. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8738.82s)]
*  It's like, how about pro-life? How about we get your, you know, you're going out working every day. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8743.699999999999s)]
*  That's great because you know why? You're getting your blood and your lymph flowing and you're [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8747.86s)]
*  sweating. You sweat, you know, the aluminum comes out in your sweat. Toxic metals come out in your [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8751.22s)]
*  sweat. You create salt levels in your blood that stimulates your skin immune system, which is a [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8755.539999999999s)]
*  separate entity. Like I didn't know any of this when I was a conventionally practicing doctor. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8760.98s)]
*  To even say, like I wanted to detoxify mercury out of my patients in order to lower their blood [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8765.859999999999s)]
*  pressure. And I was told that that was not allowed. We're not like, well then I don't want to do this [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8770.9s)]
*  anymore because I know from a hair mineral analysis and from a chelation test that that person is [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8775.14s)]
*  burdened with aluminum and mercury. And I know that those, both of those things can raise blood [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8780.42s)]
*  pressure. So why wouldn't we want to remove that? The same reason we're not allowed to save vaccines. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8785.38s)]
*  You know what a multi-billion dollar industry blood pressure treatment is [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8790.18s)]
*  and cholesterol treatment is? Oh no. Forget about it. Yeah. I mean, I saw malignant hypertension [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8793.62s)]
*  after it happened after a tetanus shot in an adult patient of mine. And so that was another one, [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8800.980000000001s)]
*  you know, thing that woke me up and I was like, well, gosh, that's weird. And then I, [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8804.820000000002s)]
*  you'd look up, you see there's other case reports and then you're told well, [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8808.26s)]
*  case reports don't mean anything. You need randomized controlled studies. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8811.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So it's, it's like, there's frustration at every corner, but I love doing what I do now. And [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8817.300000000001s)]
*  I love the fact, look, it was all, it's all great. Like I wouldn't change anything in my life. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8823.539999999999s)]
*  Just put it that way. And I'm really glad I have the background of conventional medicine, but [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8827.779999999999s)]
*  that's like background of conventional medicine is like year one and really learning about [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8831.619999999999s)]
*  healing and life. It's just, it's the very basics and, and, and doctors still need to keep learning. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8835.779999999999s)]
*  But most conventional doctors are mandated to keep learning, but they can, they're told where they [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8841.779999999999s)]
*  can read to get their credits every year. You can only get your credit from reading this and [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8847.3s)]
*  answering the questions like a good little doggy every year, which I still have to do. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8850.66s)]
*  But, but beyond that, when I have my own spare time, you know, like I've learned ozone therapy, [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8856.18s)]
*  I've learned how to use vitamin C, I've learned how to look at the body electromagnetically and [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8861.46s)]
*  use bio resonance. And there's just so much stuff you can do that really helps people and keeps them [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8865.619999999999s)]
*  out of a whole bunch of trouble that they would have gotten into if they went and took allergy [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8871.539999999999s)]
*  medicines and got their tonsils out or kept on their blood pressure medications and let the [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8874.66s)]
*  inflammation go wild in their body and didn't know anything about how to dampen. Look, most disease [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8879.14s)]
*  comes from inflammation, you know, cholesterol is trying to save you. It's not trying to kill you. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8883.46s)]
*  The cholesterol is a response to inflammation. It's like your fever is trying to save your life. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8887.779999999999s)]
*  It's like everything in medicine is about dampening down the symptoms that are trying to save your [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8891.939999999999s)]
*  life. You know, so it's like, I look at it, I think I can't believe I ever actually agreed upon that. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8897.14s)]
*  Well, it took a lot of courage to step out of line and speak your mind and I'm really glad you did [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8904.74s)]
*  because I hope more will realize that this is what a doctor is supposed to do. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8912.74s)]
*  And you're not supposed to be a spokesperson for an industry that's pretty sociopathic, [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8918.74s)]
*  you know, which makes some, you know, great strides. Look, there's a lot of amazing orthopedic [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8924.02s)]
*  surgeons and eye surgeons and neurosurgeons. There's a lot of amazing work being done [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8930.66s)]
*  by medicine. But then there's also the pharmaceutical drug company, which [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8935.78s)]
*  when attached to that and to the money people, they want to make more money every time they can. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8941.38s)]
*  Every quarter, they want to have a bigger quarter, they want a bigger house, they want a bigger jet, [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8947.46s)]
*  and they just keep going. And the way to get money is to get you to take their stuff. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8951.3s)]
*  It's not to heal you. The way they really make money is to convince you that you're sick. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8956.34s)]
*  And if that wasn't the case, we would have more medical freedom than we have, right? [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8961.86s)]
*  Right. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8965.460000000001s)]
*  Because we would have choices, we would have options, we wouldn't be told what we have to do [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8965.78s)]
*  to protect the public. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8969.14s)]
*  You shouldn't be shamed for getting better from some other way. That wouldn't be a thing. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8970.26s)]
*  I know. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8975.7s)]
*  That wouldn't be a thing. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8976.18s)]
*  Pretty crazy, isn't it? [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8976.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty weird. Well, thank you very much for doing what you do and for writing that book [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8977.86s)]
*  because it was a real eye-opener for me. I had no idea. I had no idea of the history of these things. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8982.98s)]
*  I had no idea of the correlations between when the vaccine was induced and when the death rates had [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8989.699999999999s)]
*  already dropped down. I didn't know all that stuff until I read your book. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8995.859999999999s)]
*  Who gave you the book? [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8998.82s)]
*  I do not remember. I don't remember. Somebody recommended it. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=8999.699999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9003.14s)]
*  You read it. Cheers to you. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9004.74s)]
*  Well, it's a page-turner. I listened to it in my car too and I listened to it in the sauna. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9006.9s)]
*  It's one of those books that you kind of have to go over it a couple of times just to sort of digest [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9014.98s)]
*  it and go, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9021.619999999999s)]
*  hold on. Apple cider vinegar they were using to stop people from getting smallpox? [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9025.779999999999s)]
*  Like, what the fuck is that? How is that real? [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9029.94s)]
*  Like, doctors were saying that they were treating people with smallpox and they didn't worry about [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9032.98s)]
*  getting it because they were consuming apple cider vinegar multiple times a day. And it actually [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9037.62s)]
*  worked? [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9042.34s)]
*  That's what the reports showed. Even today, apple cider vinegar, you know, it's had a big resurgence [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9042.58s)]
*  in terms of, you know, keeping your gut pH nice and low so that you can digest your food better, [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9047.3s)]
*  which has downstream effects to everything, but it's also a fermented product. You know, [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9051.94s)]
*  it's got a lot of benefits. Not just that, but even on the skin. It's like really great to put [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9057.06s)]
*  on chickenpox and probably smallpox as well. But if I may just direct people to dissolvingillusions.com [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9061.06s)]
*  because if you just go to Amazon, you're not going to, there's two different versions of the book. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9068.26s)]
*  There's the original one that you read and then there's the 10th anniversary version that has [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9071.699999999999s)]
*  200 extra pages. And we delineate early on what the new pages, what the new chapters are so you [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9075.3s)]
*  don't have to go read the old stuff if you don't want to. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9081.539999999999s)]
*  What do the new 200 pages cover? [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9083.539999999999s)]
*  It covers tuberculosis. It covers, oh, this is one of the chapters I really love. It's toxic medicine [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9085.3s)]
*  of the past, all the different crazy treatments that I was telling you about. And then I added a [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9091.859999999999s)]
*  whole bunch of the hoop and cough because more information came out after 2013. So we added that [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9095.939999999999s)]
*  in. And then we published a second book, which is all full of doctor quotes from 200 years ago, [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9100.98s)]
*  because people say, why are you the only one? It's like, well, I'm actually not the only one. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9105.619999999999s)]
*  It's like back then, this was what was recorded from doctors and public health officials, which [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9108.74s)]
*  is probably 1% of what actually was said. And then we have hard to find vaccination tragedies, [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9113.46s)]
*  royal commission on vaccination, timeline. And then we have rare documents at the back [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9120.259999999998s)]
*  that has like the Encyclopedia Britannica where they hired a very highly decorated, [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9125.539999999999s)]
*  well-known, highly respected doctor to write a chapter on smallpox. And at the end, [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9130.58s)]
*  when he did what I did and basically looked at all the facts, he decimated the vaccine completely. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9135.14s)]
*  So you can't really find that very easily anymore. So this one is called the companion book to [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9140.74s)]
*  dissolving illusions. But you can see all the versions and we've been translated into eight [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9145.380000000001s)]
*  languages. We're about to be translated into Chinese. But the best resource is dissolvingillusions.com. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9150.42s)]
*  And it will show you what your options for purchase and where you can purchase the different books. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9156.42s)]
*  If you want an alternative press, we have an alternative press for those people that don't [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9160.1s)]
*  want to do Amazon. And all the different languages and the different versions are on there. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9164.1s)]
*  Alright. Thank you again. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. My pleasure. Bye everybody. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=207W1A_bJqI&t=9169.78s)]
