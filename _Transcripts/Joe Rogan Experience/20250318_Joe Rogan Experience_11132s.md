*  I'm a hug guy, too. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=27.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=28.0s)]
*  It shows your emotion. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=29.0s)]
*  I love a real hug, yeah. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=30.0s)]
*  A real hug where someone loves you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=31.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=33.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=34.0s)]
*  You know I love you. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=35.0s)]
*  So I give you a love hug. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=36.0s)]
*  I know you love me. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=37.0s)]
*  I know you love me. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=38.0s)]
*  We've been friends for a long time, brother. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=39.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=41.0s)]
*  We really have. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=42.0s)]
*  It's nice, like, having friends that you've been friends with for just decades. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=43.0s)]
*  I always say, I've said this before, but I always say, you're like, I never had a brother [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=48.0s)]
*  growing up. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=54.0s)]
*  And you've always been pretty honest with me, the way a big brother would be, and you've [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=55.0s)]
*  always come from a place of love. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=59.0s)]
*  I remember the whole reason, my whole, I was doing nothing and fucking nothing. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=62.0s)]
*  I'm sitting in the backstage of the store with you, and you look at you, you go, Tommy's [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=67.0s)]
*  doing theaters. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=70.0s)]
*  And I said, okay. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=71.0s)]
*  And you need to be doing theaters. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=72.0s)]
*  I was like, okay. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=74.0s)]
*  And you're like, you need a Netflix special. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=75.0s)]
*  You need to get one. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=76.0s)]
*  I was like, all right, Joe, how am I supposed to do that? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=77.0s)]
*  And you go, be undeniable. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=80.0s)]
*  And you just walked away. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=81.0s)]
*  And I fucking was like, that's the kind of mentorship you look for in a friend. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=82.0s)]
*  That's who you want to be around. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=86.0s)]
*  Surround yourself with great white sharks, and people think you're a great white shark. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=87.0s)]
*  Well, you were always really fun and really funny, but you were always doing these travel [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=90.0s)]
*  channel shows. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=95.0s)]
*  And this is what drove me crazy. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=96.0s)]
*  I remember the day. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=98.0s)]
*  We've talked about it before, but I remember the day. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=99.0s)]
*  I was in the comedy store, and I was calling you from the main room, and you were on a [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=100.0s)]
*  motorcycle in Vietnam. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=104.0s)]
*  And I think you were drunk. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=106.0s)]
*  And I was drunk and hot. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=111.0s)]
*  Two things you're not supposed to be on a motorcycle. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=113.0s)]
*  No helmet, inflip flops. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=117.0s)]
*  Which is, by the way, it's a fun way to catch somebody when you call someone and you're [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=119.0s)]
*  going to go on stage in like 20 minutes. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=125.0s)]
*  I'm just checking in on you, see what's going on. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=127.0s)]
*  And you're on a fucking motorcycle in Vietnam. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=128.0s)]
*  I'm laughing. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=130.0s)]
*  But then I was like, dude, you really need to dedicate yourself to stand up. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=131.0s)]
*  This is a trap. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=135.0s)]
*  It's a velvet prison. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=136.0s)]
*  These TV shows are a velvet prison. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=137.0s)]
*  And when you're on the travel channel, you're not even getting, you're making great money, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=139.0s)]
*  right? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=143.0s)]
*  But you're not getting, I can retire now money. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=144.0s)]
*  There's no fuck you money. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=146.0s)]
*  It's I can live well money. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=148.0s)]
*  It's a great job. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=149.0s)]
*  But it's one of those jobs where at a certain point in time you got to go, okay, I have [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=151.0s)]
*  to jump ship. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=155.0s)]
*  I can't keep doing this. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=157.0s)]
*  This is going to fuck up everything else I'm doing. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=159.0s)]
*  It's hard to pull that trigger too, because like with kids and a family and a house and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=162.0s)]
*  you go, okay, it's not great money, but it's good money. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=167.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=170.0s)]
*  And the road was not great money. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=171.0s)]
*  And I remember you saying you need a Netflix special. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=172.0s)]
*  I remember you saying that to me on that motorcycle. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=174.0s)]
*  I'm sitting, I pulled, I had headsets and I was listening to the doors, a magic caravan, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=177.0s)]
*  Spanish caravan. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=182.0s)]
*  And I was flying. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=183.0s)]
*  I was high. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=184.0s)]
*  There were oxen on either side of me. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=185.0s)]
*  The sun was setting. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=186.0s)]
*  And you're like, dude, this is who you are. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=188.0s)]
*  Fuck that travel channel bullshit. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=190.0s)]
*  Get away from it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=191.0s)]
*  You need to focus on stand up in your podcast. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=192.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=194.0s)]
*  And I was like, yeah. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=195.0s)]
*  You're like, you're the fucking machine. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=196.0s)]
*  If you don't talk about this on stage, then you're not doing yourself, you're doing yourself [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=197.0s)]
*  a disservice. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=200.0s)]
*  Well, there's certain people that like, you know, their full potential because when they're [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=201.0s)]
*  with you, they're completely relaxed and you know, everyone's just having a great time [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=205.0s)]
*  and you get to see them at their best. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=212.0s)]
*  And when you're crying, laughing, just hanging out, talking to a guy, you're like, this guy's [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=214.0s)]
*  got it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=218.0s)]
*  He's just got to figure out how to get rid of all the other shit in his life and focus [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=219.0s)]
*  on that because you were always so fucking funny. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=223.0s)]
*  And I was like, how is this guy doing these shows where he's letting people hurt him and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=226.0s)]
*  all this? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=230.0s)]
*  Like when you were doing hurt, Bert, I was like, what are you doing? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=231.0s)]
*  Don't get hurt. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=234.0s)]
*  And then I just that also I'd gone through it with Fear Factor. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=235.0s)]
*  Like Fear Factor was a great job. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=240.0s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=242.0s)]
*  Very happy that I got it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=243.0s)]
*  It was wonderful. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=244.0s)]
*  It gave me fuck you money. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=245.0s)]
*  It gave me the ability to do whatever I want after that. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=247.0s)]
*  But it was a thing where I was like, this is not what I want to do. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=250.0s)]
*  What I want to do is what I always do, just stand up and have fun. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=253.0s)]
*  You know, if I was I was doing the UFC back then too. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=257.0s)]
*  So I was like, do the UFC commentary, things I love doing. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=261.0s)]
*  That's what I want to be doing. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=263.0s)]
*  I don't want to be doing just a job. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=264.0s)]
*  Jobs are great. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=266.0s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=267.0s)]
*  Thankful I got it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=268.0s)]
*  But at a certain point in time, if you want to reach your full potential, you have to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=269.0s)]
*  realize like this is holding me back. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=272.0s)]
*  And sometimes people don't want to tell you that because it's a job and it's a great [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=274.0s)]
*  get. And I've had people I've had people tell me, like, don't leave Fear Factor. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=277.0s)]
*  My what the fuck are you talking about? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=280.0s)]
*  I have to leave. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=281.0s)]
*  I have to leave. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=282.0s)]
*  I got to go. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=283.0s)]
*  I remember those times. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=284.0s)]
*  I remember people saying because I knew you were I knew you as Joe the stand up. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=286.0s)]
*  And I remember people saying he does comedy. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=289.0s)]
*  And I was like, no, that's what he does. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=293.0s)]
*  Like he's not an actor. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=295.0s)]
*  He's not a host. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=296.0s)]
*  He's a comedian. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=297.0s)]
*  But that's understandable. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=298.0s)]
*  Right. Like my my stand up. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=299.0s)]
*  I'd only done like by then. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=300.0s)]
*  I'd only done like a couple things that were out that were available. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=302.0s)]
*  And I was on the hugest show in television. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=307.0s)]
*  Fear Factor was fucking gigantic. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=310.0s)]
*  It was massive. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=312.0s)]
*  It was nuts. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=313.0s)]
*  It was massive. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=314.0s)]
*  Monday nights. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=315.0s)]
*  Yeah. It was a fun job. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=316.0s)]
*  You know, it's a big show when 20 years later you remember the night it was on. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=317.0s)]
*  But this is what's important. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=320.0s)]
*  Even though it was the number one show in the country, I still had that feeling like I don't [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=322.0s)]
*  want to really be doing this. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=325.0s)]
*  I'm happy to do it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=326.0s)]
*  It's very thankful that I got the job. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=328.0s)]
*  I worked with some amazing people. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=330.0s)]
*  It was a lot of fun. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=332.0s)]
*  We had a great crew. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=333.0s)]
*  Really fun time. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=334.0s)]
*  But I didn't want to do it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=335.0s)]
*  I wanted to do this. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=336.0s)]
*  This is what I didn't know. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=337.0s)]
*  I wanted to do this because this wasn't a thing, you know. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=338.0s)]
*  But once I figured it out, I was like, oh, this is what I want to do. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=341.0s)]
*  I want to do this and stand up and the UFC, which is like to me, it's not even a job. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=344.0s)]
*  It's like a vacation. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=349.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=350.0s)]
*  It's crazy watching you operate in the UFC and seeing that mechanism and to think when [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=351.0s)]
*  you started that, like how far that path with the UFC has been for you. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=356.0s)]
*  Oh, for me, it was 97. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=361.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=362.0s)]
*  But walking in through the other day and I was like, oh, this has been Joe's life for [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=363.0s)]
*  fucking 26 years. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=366.0s)]
*  Well, you know, if you want, if you're a person who's a martial artist and you're a fan of [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=369.0s)]
*  martial arts, if you get a job to do that, like if you get a job to talk about martial [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=375.0s)]
*  arts and to express your love for and your appreciation for the athletes, appreciation [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=381.0s)]
*  for the fighters and what they have to go through to get to where they're at and the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=386.0s)]
*  magnitude of their accomplishments and to put words to that, like to do that, to be [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=390.0s)]
*  able to do that for a living. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=394.0s)]
*  That's an honor. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=395.0s)]
*  That's how I feel. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=396.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=397.0s)]
*  It's like it's an honor. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=398.0s)]
*  It's an honor. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=399.0s)]
*  And I feel like I do a good job at it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=400.0s)]
*  And so and I like doing it and I'm super passionate about it and I don't do it because it's a [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=401.0s)]
*  job. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=406.0s)]
*  I do it because I love it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=407.0s)]
*  Like I don't need to do it. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=408.0s)]
*  I could have quit a long time ago. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=410.0s)]
*  Does like I could just watch it like we're doing a fight companion this weekend. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=412.0s)]
*  It's gonna be fun. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=415.0s)]
*  We're gonna hang out. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=416.0s)]
*  What are you doing Saturday? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=417.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=418.0s)]
*  Oh, I'm in Vegas. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=419.0s)]
*  Are you really? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=420.0s)]
*  I have two shows in Vegas this weekend at Resorts World Theater. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=421.0s)]
*  Oh, I should say my special lucky is streaming right now on Netflix. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=424.0s)]
*  Right now. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=428.0s)]
*  Right now. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=429.0s)]
*  I say lucky. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=430.0s)]
*  I say lucky because I am the luckiest fucking guy in the world. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=431.0s)]
*  I really am. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=434.0s)]
*  When you think about like you think about like finding the friends I did later in life, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=435.0s)]
*  you know, like at like 37 or 38 when I started meeting all you guys and hanging out with [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=439.0s)]
*  you guys and then and then you know being and being getting into comedy at the time [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=443.0s)]
*  I did like we got into comedy when no one it wasn't a job. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=448.0s)]
*  It was like right. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=452.0s)]
*  It was weird. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=453.0s)]
*  It was like joining the fucking circus. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=454.0s)]
*  It was. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=455.0s)]
*  And I got only got into comedy because I got discovered by Rolling Stone magazine as the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=456.0s)]
*  number one party animal in the country. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=459.0s)]
*  I mean what are the fucking odds of my life tracking out? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=460.0s)]
*  So I that's why I named it lucky. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=463.0s)]
*  Well, we're all very lucky. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=465.0s)]
*  We're very lucky. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=467.0s)]
*  That's absolutely sure. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=468.0s)]
*  No, no dispute. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=469.0s)]
*  We're all very lucky. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=470.0s)]
*  If you're listening to this, you're very lucky because you can fucking hear. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=471.0s)]
*  How about that? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=474.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=475.0s)]
*  If you're watching it, you're very lucky. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=476.0s)]
*  You can see you're very lucky that you can afford a phone. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=477.0s)]
*  We're very lucky. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=479.0s)]
*  Like most of the world lives in utter poverty. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=480.0s)]
*  And that's the unfortunate reality of all these people virtue signaling about the 1 percent [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=483.0s)]
*  like bitch. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=488.0s)]
*  You're in the 1 percent. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=489.0s)]
*  There's someone digging blood diamonds in Sarah Lyon right now smoking brown brown and [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=490.0s)]
*  he's 11. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=494.0s)]
*  If you make thirty four thousand dollars in America, you're in the 1 percent of the world. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=495.0s)]
*  How about that? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=501.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=502.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=503.0s)]
*  That's real. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=504.0s)]
*  My great my father-in-law still isn't in that 1 percent. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=505.0s)]
*  Hey, life's not good for everybody. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=514.0s)]
*  Life's not good for everybody. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=515.0s)]
*  Some people get lucky at all. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=516.0s)]
*  I've been trying to wrap my mind around the idea of quantum computing. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=518.0s)]
*  It's exciting but complex and difficult to understand. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=522.0s)]
*  What I do know is that quantum computers can process exponentially more data than the ones [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=526.0s)]
*  you and I use every day. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=532.0s)]
*  Quantum computers also put a new strain on the world of digital privacy and cybersecurity. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=534.0s)]
*  They may one day crack encryption algorithms that we currently consider secure. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=540.0s)]
*  That's why ExpressVPN upgraded their encryption to use MLKEM, the strongest available protection [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=546.0s)]
*  from post quantum threats. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=555.0s)]
*  With ExpressVPN, all your online activity is rerouted through secure encrypted servers. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=557.0s)]
*  Even though all your data is still being handled by your internet provider or whoever the provider [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=564.0s)]
*  is for the random public Wi-Fi network you're on. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=570.0s)]
*  None of these third parties will be able to read your data or hijack your connection for malicious intent. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=573.0s)]
*  And with post quantum protection, ExpressVPN is essentially future proofing your privacy. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=581.0s)]
*  Just one of many reasons why ExpressVPN is the absolute best VPN out there. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=588.0s)]
*  So if you want to get the highest standards of post quantum protection from your VPN service, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=594.0s)]
*  tap the banner or go to expressvpn.com slash rogan. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=600.0s)]
*  And now listeners can get four extra months for free. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=605.0s)]
*  That's expressvpn.com slash rogan. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=609.0s)]
*  And if you're watching on YouTube, you can get your four free months by scanning the QR code on screen [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=612.0s)]
*  or by clicking the link in the description. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=620.0s)]
*  I always think luck is a perspective. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=623.0s)]
*  You work hard, dude. You're not just lucky. You work hard. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=626.0s)]
*  You work real hard. You're always touring. You're always doing things. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=629.0s)]
*  You're always putting together new shit. You're always working. You're always hustling. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=633.0s)]
*  Like it's not just luck. It's luck plus, you know, you love to party, but you also have a great work ethic. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=636.0s)]
*  And that's very, very important, man. It's like you can't just be lucky. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=644.0s)]
*  Lucky is huge. You got to get lucky. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=649.0s)]
*  But also if you work really hard, you tend to get luckier, especially if you're smart and if you're willing to take risks. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=652.0s)]
*  Like for you, the travel channel thing, that was a risk. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=657.0s)]
*  You had to listen to your friends and you had to go, you know what? They're fucking right. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=659.0s)]
*  Everybody else is cooking right now. And my stand-up is kind of stalled out because I'm doing this TV show. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=664.0s)]
*  And again, it's coming from someone who was there. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=669.0s)]
*  And I'm telling you that if you're making millions and you still feel that way, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=672.0s)]
*  versus if you're making thousands and you still feel that way, you got to trust me. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=677.0s)]
*  There's another way to get through this. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=681.0s)]
*  And the other way we found we got, you know, we were right. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=683.0s)]
*  Yeah. Look, we fucking saw light at the end of the tunnel. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=687.0s)]
*  We were like, this is the way to go. And we were right. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=690.0s)]
*  I remember you telling all of us, you guys need a podcast. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=693.0s)]
*  I remember saying to Tom, he's out of his mind. Why don't we just do his? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=695.0s)]
*  Yeah, everybody thought I was out of my mind for even doing mine. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=698.0s)]
*  Like people mocked me openly. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=701.0s)]
*  Like Howard Stern famously mocked all people that were doing podcasts. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=703.0s)]
*  You're wasting your time. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=706.0s)]
*  But in his mind, that was correct because he didn't he didn't have this. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=708.0s)]
*  He wasn't an Internet kid. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=712.0s)]
*  You know, I'm not an Internet kid. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=714.0s)]
*  But, you know, I used to build my own computers in the 90s. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=716.0s)]
*  I used to go to Fry's Electronics and get motherboards and hard drives. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=720.0s)]
*  And yeah, my friend Andrew used to help me over the phone. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=725.0s)]
*  I'd call him. He's a like a wizard tech guy. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=729.0s)]
*  And so like I had bought all these like high end gaming computers and upgraded the video cards. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=733.0s)]
*  And I was on all these like crazy websites. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=740.0s)]
*  We'd send each other like, you know, those are the two girls, one cup days. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=744.0s)]
*  So I was pretty plugged in. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=747.0s)]
*  Was it Mr. Smiles or something? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=749.0s)]
*  Mr. Hands. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=751.0s)]
*  Mr. Hands. Keep going. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=752.0s)]
*  So there was I was pretty plugged in to the idea that the Internet was something that people were finding stuff [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=753.0s)]
*  that just wasn't available anywhere else. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=760.0s)]
*  I got all these like crazy lectures, these Alan Watts lectures that I downloaded. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=762.0s)]
*  I'm like, this is nuts. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=768.0s)]
*  That's back when you had to download stuff and then you had to upload it to an air pod. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=769.0s)]
*  Remember your air pods with the wheel? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=773.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Those were the shit. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=775.0s)]
*  Oh, I remember that. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=777.0s)]
*  Yeah, the little wheel that was spun around. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=779.0s)]
*  I love that thing. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=781.0s)]
*  And so I would download all these Terrence McKenna lectures and all these Timothy Leary, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=782.0s)]
*  all these like fascinating conversations that I would download. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=788.0s)]
*  And then I started thinking about it. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=792.0s)]
*  And then I was like, well, there's podcasts. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=794.0s)]
*  So people just like start. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=797.0s)]
*  Let's just start doing one of those. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=799.0s)]
*  We just start doing it. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=801.0s)]
*  I was like, nobody was listening to them. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=802.0s)]
*  It was like Adam Carolla had a big one because Adam had just left terrestrial radio. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=804.0s)]
*  He was the morning guy that replaced Howard Stern when Howard Stern went to XM. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=809.0s)]
*  Right. So he's he's on or serious, whatever it was. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=813.0s)]
*  So it's both now. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=816.0s)]
*  I think they're combined. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=817.0s)]
*  So he's on morning radio all over the country. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=818.0s)]
*  But morning radio is like super stagnant. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=822.0s)]
*  And they had a L.A. morning radio station where it was all more excuse me, talk radio station was all talk radio. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=824.0s)]
*  So it was Tom Likus. It was him. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=831.0s)]
*  It was there was a few other people. I can't remember. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=834.0s)]
*  Ricky Rockman had a show. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=836.0s)]
*  Phil Hendry, I think, had a show. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=838.0s)]
*  He had a different show. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=840.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Phil Hendry was an A.M. guy. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=841.0s)]
*  He was that was the greatest. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=843.0s)]
*  That was the greatest show. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=844.0s)]
*  It's one of the greatest shows of all time. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=846.0s)]
*  And he's a super nice guy. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=847.0s)]
*  I met him once in Montreal. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=849.0s)]
*  So for people who don't know Phil Hendry, he's the caller and he's the answerer. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=851.0s)]
*  He does different voices and he he gets people so angry because the callers will say the dumbest fucking shit. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=856.0s)]
*  And then you'll have actual people calling in to argue with the caller who's all Phil Hendry. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=864.0s)]
*  Yeah. I remember sitting next to my dad's bed. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=870.0s)]
*  My dad's in his underwear and he's got his alarm clock and we're listening to it. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=872.0s)]
*  My dad's just like this. My dad goes, buddy, he's both of them. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=877.0s)]
*  I was like, what? He goes, this is all him. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=880.0s)]
*  Yes. And you're just like, whoa. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=882.0s)]
*  I mean, it was so ahead of its time. So ahead of its time. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=884.0s)]
*  And once you were in on the joke, it was amazing. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=886.0s)]
*  Oh, it was amazing. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=888.0s)]
*  If I was coming home from the store, I'd always is Phil Hendry or Art Bell. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=889.0s)]
*  That's what I listened to. God. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=893.0s)]
*  The old days. So Art Bell was my favorite. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=895.0s)]
*  What was Art Bell? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=898.0s)]
*  Art Bell was coast to coast with Art Bell from the kingdom of Nye. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=899.0s)]
*  He was broadcasting from a fucking bunker in the middle of the Nevada desert. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=904.0s)]
*  He was in he like had like this crazy radio tower outside of his house in the Nevada desert. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=910.0s)]
*  And he would have he would take calls from time travelers, werewolves, people that are coming from another dimension. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=916.0s)]
*  Nuttiest fucking show for real. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=925.0s)]
*  Like one of my greatest career accomplishments that like made me the most happy was I got on the Art Bell show and I got on it like way later when he was on the Internet. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=927.0s)]
*  It wasn't even on radio anywhere. But for me, it was like I got on the Art Bell show. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=935.0s)]
*  Yes. It was just like I just loved that show. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=939.0s)]
*  It was so fun because I'd be driving on that. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=942.0s)]
*  That looks that was his house. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=945.0s)]
*  So look at if you see like what his house looked like, it's like his house is in the middle of nowhere in the fucking desert. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=947.0s)]
*  I mean, the middle of nowhere. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=953.0s)]
*  There's nothing around his house and his house is all fenced in like chain link fence and shit. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=955.0s)]
*  It looks like so it looks so psychotic, like perfect for a guy that is broadcasting. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=960.0s)]
*  He's got like this compound in the fucking desert, dude. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=967.0s)]
*  God. Yeah, it was amazing. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=971.0s)]
*  He would broadcast right from there because radio, if you have a tower and you have a station, you can broadcast the whole country. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=974.0s)]
*  The country can carry it. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=982.0s)]
*  So the whole country was carrying coast to coast with Art Bell. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=984.0s)]
*  And this wild motherfucker is out in the middle of nowhere in the desert in like a compound talking to aliens. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=987.0s)]
*  They were doing they were doing what we're doing now way before before the. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=995.0s)]
*  Oh, yes. Well, we owe all we have today to Howard Stern and Art Bell for sure. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=998.0s)]
*  Because, you know, we are kind of like a combination of Howard Stern and Art Bell. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1006.0s)]
*  And if it wasn't for it, wasn't for he's the guy that got arrested or didn't get arrested, but he got fined heavily by the Bush administration. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1010.0s)]
*  This is back from the Republicans were the ones that were trying to censor people, which you should always realize. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1019.0s)]
*  Crazy to say that this fucking stupid game that people play back and forth with, you know, who loves war, who hates war, who loves censorship, who hates censorship. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1025.0s)]
*  It's a political beach ball that they toss around at a concert to keep people occupied. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1034.0s)]
*  These motherfuckers switch sides. That should tell you enough alone by yourself, but by itself right there that they fucking switch sides. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1039.0s)]
*  But he was getting attacked for obscenity. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1046.0s)]
*  So he put like whatever they would do. And they were they were they find what was the total amount that Howard Stern was fined. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1050.0s)]
*  So this has to be you got a neurotic guy as it is. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1057.0s)]
*  Right. Who's also the most pioneering radio guy of all time. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1060.0s)]
*  He's the guy that changed radio from DJs playing records to just talking and talking in your authentic voice and not, hey, welcome back. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1065.0s)]
*  Talking in your authentic voice and having wild shit on the radio. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1076.0s)]
*  Two point five million dollars million between 1990 and 2004. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1079.0s)]
*  So they fucked with him for 14 years. Fourteen years. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1084.0s)]
*  And that's not paid by the station. That's paid by him. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1089.0s)]
*  Find owners of radio station licenses that carried the Howard Stern show. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1091.0s)]
*  A total of two point five million for content and considered to be indecent and decent. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1097.0s)]
*  So all the stuff that we do on podcasts right now, we would one hundred percent have been fined. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1101.0s)]
*  One hundred percent. I would have been off the air a long time ago. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1107.0s)]
*  It was real censorship, but it was just done under the guise of, you know, broadcast. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1110.0s)]
*  Like the idea is like if you're going to broadcast something on a major network like NBC, CBS, they have rules to language and what you're allowed to show, which is kind of crazy. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1116.0s)]
*  Like, why do you have those rules? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1127.0s)]
*  Like, why do those rules exist to keep obscenity from television? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1129.0s)]
*  And like, maybe that was a good idea in 1950, but people didn't know any better. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1132.0s)]
*  But now that we know better, like, why do you have rules like that? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1136.0s)]
*  I can't believe that radio still has those rules and the rules are slippery. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1139.0s)]
*  You can say dickhead. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1142.0s)]
*  You can't say cunt. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1144.0s)]
*  But you can't say suck my dick. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1145.0s)]
*  You can't say anything you want to say. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1146.0s)]
*  Like sometimes cunt's the right word. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1148.0s)]
*  Cunt's one of my favorite words. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1151.0s)]
*  Every now and then it's the right word when used correctly. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1152.0s)]
*  But like, if you can't say it, then you can't fully express yourself. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1155.0s)]
*  And if you don't like people fully expressing themselves because you don't like certain sounds, I suggest you grow the fuck up. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1159.0s)]
*  That's a ridiculous way to think. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1168.0s)]
*  Think. If I can say cock, but I can't say cocksucker. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1170.0s)]
*  If I could say dick, like dick Chaney, but I can't say suck a dick. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1176.0s)]
*  Like, what are we doing? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1181.0s)]
*  It's the same sound. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1183.0s)]
*  You're making the same sound. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1185.0s)]
*  I can say pussy, cat. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1187.0s)]
*  Pussy cat's fine. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1189.0s)]
*  You know, you can't say N-word breakfast. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1191.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1193.0s)]
*  You can. You have to look both ways. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1195.0s)]
*  You gotta be black. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1197.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1198.0s)]
*  Like if you want to say certain words that are forbidden words, sometimes they're okay. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1199.0s)]
*  So it's the sound is sometimes okay. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1203.0s)]
*  It even gets trickier. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1206.0s)]
*  Like there was a video I was cutting to promote my tour or whatever. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1207.0s)]
*  And it's me on a boat or the special. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1210.0s)]
*  It's me on a boat. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1212.0s)]
*  And there's this page I'm really obsessed with. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1214.0s)]
*  It's fat N-word season. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1217.0s)]
*  Joe is so addictive. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1220.0s)]
*  And it's just it's all AI. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1222.0s)]
*  And I think they're promoting a crypto coin. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1225.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1227.0s)]
*  And I was like, I didn't like the edit. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1228.0s)]
*  So I go, hey, put fat N-word summer. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1230.0s)]
*  Play that song. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1232.0s)]
*  And it's fucking so much funnier, Joe. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1234.0s)]
*  It's so much funnier with me shirtless on a boat. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1236.0s)]
*  These guys are great. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1239.0s)]
*  But my wife saw it. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1241.0s)]
*  She was like, that's offensive. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1242.0s)]
*  I was like, no. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1244.0s)]
*  She's right. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1245.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then I said it to Tommy. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1247.0s)]
*  I go, is this racist? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1248.0s)]
*  And he was like, sent to the wrong guy. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1249.0s)]
*  All Tom sends me is videos of fat black chicks on rope swings. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1254.0s)]
*  Or a whole thread. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1261.0s)]
*  It's just any time a chick takes an L off a cliff. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1264.0s)]
*  I got to get on that thread because the one me and Tommy are on is horrible. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1268.0s)]
*  What's that one? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1271.0s)]
*  It's all murder. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1272.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1273.0s)]
*  We send each other to the murder and car accidents. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1274.0s)]
*  Today was a car accident. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1276.0s)]
*  It was guys escaping the cops. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1277.0s)]
*  And the guy flips this van multiple times, gets thrown into traffic. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1279.0s)]
*  And then run over by cars. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1283.0s)]
*  And it's just splatterfest. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1284.0s)]
*  I can't watch those. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1287.0s)]
*  I was telling someone, my niece had my phone. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1288.0s)]
*  And she's like, for three. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1294.0s)]
*  And you forget what your algorithm looks like. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1296.0s)]
*  And it was Fat M where Summer Song came on. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1299.0s)]
*  And she's like, Uncle Bert. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1302.0s)]
*  And then the next video was a chick pissing on the plasticine's head. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1303.0s)]
*  And I was like, maybe you shouldn't use my phone to relax with. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1307.0s)]
*  Yeah, my kids know better. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1310.0s)]
*  My algorithm is fucked, dude. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1312.0s)]
*  Yeah, my algorithm's not good. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1313.0s)]
*  It is fucked. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1315.0s)]
*  My YouTube algorithm's great. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1316.0s)]
*  Oh, my YouTube algorithm's all history. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1318.0s)]
*  A lot of my YouTube algorithm lately has been watching people build things. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1320.0s)]
*  I love cabinet makers and carpenters. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1325.0s)]
*  There's this one guy who makes these specialized desks that have secret drawers and shit. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1328.0s)]
*  Oh, hold on. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1333.0s)]
*  I follow that guy. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1334.0s)]
*  Where you put your hand here. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1335.0s)]
*  And a magnet comes up and a wand comes out and he waves it. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1336.0s)]
*  Fuck, those desks are awesome. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1339.0s)]
*  Fuck, those desks are badass. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1341.0s)]
*  Yeah, he waved the wand and the keyboard rolls out. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1342.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty dope. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1345.0s)]
*  There's a bunch of those guys that make these super ingenious, homemade, artisan desks. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1347.0s)]
*  That or if you get me a chick with no bra doing survival techniques in the woods, fucking I'm in. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1354.0s)]
*  That's a sell. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1360.0s)]
*  I've watched so many of those. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1361.0s)]
*  Rock hard nipples. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1362.0s)]

*  Oh, a lot of that. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1378.0s)]
*  I ran into Paige Spirinak at the Super Bowl. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1379.0s)]
*  And I was like, I had to be real because I'm a golfer. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1383.0s)]
*  I was like, I follow you for your swing. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1385.0s)]
*  You have a great swing. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1387.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1388.0s)]
*  But then you know what's crazy about Paige? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1389.0s)]
*  She can't snap her fingers or whistle. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1391.0s)]
*  How did you find that out? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1395.0s)]
*  Because we were playing a game like Weird Things About Us and she was like, I can't snap my fingers. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1398.0s)]
*  And I watched her and she went like this. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1403.0s)]
*  She was like. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1404.0s)]
*  And I go and she goes, I can't whistle. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1406.0s)]
*  And she starts going. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1408.0s)]
*  How could you not snap your fingers? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1409.0s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1410.0s)]
*  She's the most followed golfer, Joe. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1412.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1414.0s)]
*  And she's not. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1415.0s)]
*  Tiger Woods only has 3.5 million followers and she's got four and she's not a professional. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1416.0s)]
*  Yeah. If you're hot, you could do a lot in this world. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1422.0s)]
*  And you can also not whistle and snap. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1424.0s)]
*  You don't have to snap. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1426.0s)]
*  That's not important. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1427.0s)]
*  Do you care? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1428.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1429.0s)]
*  She's super hot. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1430.0s)]
*  But she does have a great swing. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1431.0s)]
*  I bet she does. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1432.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1433.0s)]
*  If she's not wearing a bra, it's so good. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1434.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1435.0s)]
*  Just watch. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1436.0s)]
*  This seems pornographic almost. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1437.0s)]
*  Oh, there we go. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1438.0s)]
*  I wonder why she's got so many followers. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1439.0s)]
*  She's got a golf. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1442.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1443.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1444.0s)]
*  It's got a good swing. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1445.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1447.0s)]
*  I don't even know if I saw any movement. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1448.0s)]
*  I swear to God, if I had tits. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1454.0s)]
*  You want to talk about Lucky. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1455.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1456.0s)]
*  That's the Willy Wonka Golden Ticket. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1457.0s)]
*  Being a super hot woman, all you have to do is be nice and doors just open up everywhere. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1458.0s)]
*  Like, da da da da, she's here. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1464.0s)]
*  If you're that hot, anywhere you go. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1466.0s)]
*  Red carpets get rolled out. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1469.0s)]
*  Roses get thrown at your feet. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1471.0s)]
*  She was walking down a radio row at Super Bowl with Cam Heyward and both of us were like, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1472.0s)]
*  just stop talking. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1476.0s)]
*  But also, creepers. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1477.0s)]
*  Creepers launch themselves at you. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1479.0s)]
*  You're never invisible. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1481.0s)]
*  Guys are fucking with you all the time. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1483.0s)]
*  Overconfident guys are hitting on you all the time and then getting really mean when you reject them. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1485.0s)]
*  That's the thing that chicks have to deal with. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1490.0s)]
*  They have to deal with angry guys that are angry that they get rejected and they start insulting them and yelling at them. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1492.0s)]
*  That's scary shit, man. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1500.0s)]
*  That's scary shit. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1501.0s)]
*  Think about all our friends, all our female comedians that have stalkers. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1502.0s)]
*  I mean, it's so, you work your ass off as a comic. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1505.0s)]
*  You happen to be pretty. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1510.0s)]
*  You start killing it and then all the fucking psychos come out of the woodwork. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1511.0s)]
*  And you don't have any money. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1515.0s)]
*  So you probably live in a place that's easy to get to. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1517.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1521.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1523.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's dangerous. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1524.0s)]
*  There's a lot of fucking, well, we need better mental health care in this fucking country. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1525.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of people out there that are out of their fucking mind. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1531.0s)]
*  And if no one's paying attention to them or checking in on them, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1535.0s)]
*  Imagine your average guy who loses his fucking mind and you're a 40-year-old guy who works at a gas station. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1539.0s)]
*  You've been working at that gas station for 20 years and no one's paying attention. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1546.0s)]
*  And you're just slowly losing your fucking mind. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1550.0s)]
*  And you think Jared Leto is Satan. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1554.0s)]
*  And you've decided that someone's sending you code on television. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1558.0s)]
*  And then you lock on to some female comedian. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1563.0s)]
*  And that's your target. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1566.0s)]
*  That's who you're... [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1568.0s)]
*  It's kind of feel nice though. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1569.0s)]
*  What? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1570.0s)]
*  To be the lunatic. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1571.0s)]
*  No. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1572.0s)]
*  Just to have something to focus on. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1573.0s)]
*  Don't encourage this. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1575.0s)]
*  Just have something to focus on. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1577.0s)]

*  He was in, in War Dogs, he goes up and buys black money, weed from the black guys. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1888.0s)]
*  And he's like, how much? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1891.0s)]
*  You guys 120 bucks. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1892.0s)]
*  And he gives them 120 bucks. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1893.0s)]
*  And then he just started to keep talking to himself. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1894.0s)]
*  And he's like, Jonah's like, Hey, he's got a voice. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1896.0s)]
*  What are we doing here? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1898.0s)]
*  Hi guys. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1899.0s)]
*  And they're like, get the fuck out. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1900.0s)]
*  And he's like, Oh, okay. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1901.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1902.0s)]
*  And he goes to the back of his trunk and pulls out a machine gun and goes, can you listen [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1903.0s)]
*  to me now? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1908.0s)]
*  He's just awesome, dude. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1909.0s)]
*  Awesome, man. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1910.0s)]
*  I fucking love that guy. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1911.0s)]
*  But yeah, there's too many movies to be paying attention to these days. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1913.0s)]
*  When I was a kid, if you said you didn't know, you never saw Apocalypse Now. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1917.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1921.0s)]
*  You know, it's like once VHS tapes came out, you're supposed to have seen the big ones. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1922.0s)]
*  You didn't see the Godfather? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1926.0s)]
*  You didn't see Star Wars? [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1928.0s)]
*  Are you out of your fucking mind? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1929.0s)]
*  But today it's like they never stopped making movies. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1930.0s)]
*  They've never stopped. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1933.0s)]
*  They make new ones every year. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1934.0s)]
*  You can't keep up. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1935.0s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1936.0s)]
*  And all the ones that were up for Oscars, I saw none of those. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1937.0s)]
*  Well, they all involved chaos. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1940.0s)]
*  But it's like they all involve the end of civilization. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1943.0s)]
*  If you want to win an Oscar, you have to be trans lives matter all the way. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1946.0s)]
*  What do you do to win an Oscar today? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1951.0s)]
*  Like you have to have something that's got some meaning to it other than just the way [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1953.0s)]
*  it's being a good movie. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1958.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1960.0s)]
*  Like there's got to be some social justice aspect to it. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1961.0s)]
*  Wasn't it like some thing where they were talking about, God damn it. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1964.0s)]
*  I can't remember what the article was about. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1970.0s)]
*  But it was about requirements for a film to win an Oscar today. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1973.0s)]
*  What they believe to be requirements. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1979.0s)]
*  So I don't like awards. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1981.0s)]
*  Do you know what it is? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1983.0s)]
*  There was something that it was just. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1985.0s)]
*  Representation and inclusion standards. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1987.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1989.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1990.0s)]
*  That's not the only way to tell a story. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1991.0s)]
*  That's not because if you do that, you don't get Shogun. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1993.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1996.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1997.0s)]
*  You don't get Shogun. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1998.0s)]
*  You got to have an all Japanese cast. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=1999.0s)]
*  You want to get Shogun. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2000.0s)]
*  You know, you can't have a fully diverse, you know, 50 50 split of whatever. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2002.0s)]
*  Everybody. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2010.0s)]
*  You can't. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2011.0s)]
*  No. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2012.0s)]
*  You can't have a specific kind of a movie. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2013.0s)]
*  You know, if you're going to make a movie about the Congo, you can't have white people play native Congolese people. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2015.0s)]
*  You can't have that. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2020.0s)]
*  So it's like some stories are not diverse. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2021.0s)]
*  It doesn't make them less valid. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2025.0s)]
*  It doesn't mean you're racist. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2027.0s)]
*  It just means that some stories take place in Norway and they involve Vikings. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2029.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2033.0s)]
*  This is like just a part of human history. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2034.0s)]
*  You know, some places, some stories take place in Egypt and they involve Africans. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2036.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2041.0s)]
*  There's plenty of room for every kind of fucking story. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2042.0s)]
*  But if you only want like a specific type of story to win an Academy Award, you don't get the Godfather. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2046.0s)]
*  Daylight savings is coming. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2053.0s)]
*  So we're about to lose an hour. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2055.0s)]
*  And that means trying to speed up your morning. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2056.0s)]
*  But if you drink AG1, maybe you're fine with it. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2058.0s)]
*  It's that quick and easy to help your body feel great every day. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2061.0s)]
*  Starting your day with AG1 can help you shake off the grogginess, get back into your rhythm and even give you the boost you need to be able to get back into your rhythm. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2064.0s)]
*  Give you the boost you need to make the most of that extra hour of sunlight, maybe even turning you into the morning person you've always wanted to be. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2071.0s)]
*  AG1 rules. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2079.0s)]
*  I drank it for a long time now. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2080.0s)]
*  And seriously, it's as easy as I say every month. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2082.0s)]
*  You just take one scoop, put it in some cold water, shake it up and you're ready to go. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2085.0s)]
*  Honestly, tastes pretty good, too. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2089.0s)]
*  I'm not complaining. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2091.0s)]
*  It's never too late to create a new healthy habit for 2025. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2092.0s)]
*  So try AG1 for yourself. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2095.0s)]
*  It's easy to stay consistent with. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2097.0s)]
*  And that's why I've been partnering with AG1 for so long. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2099.0s)]
*  And AG1 is offering new customers a free gift. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2102.0s)]
*  When you subscribe, you'll get a welcome kit, a bottle of D3K2 and five free travel packs in your first box. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2105.0s)]
*  So make sure you check out drinkag1.com slash Joe Rogan. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2113.0s)]
*  That's drinkag1.com slash Joe Rogan. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2118.0s)]
*  You don't get that movie. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2121.0s)]
*  You don't get Jaws. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2123.0s)]
*  You got to get all Italians. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2124.0s)]
*  Star Wars. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2125.0s)]
*  If you want The Godfather. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2126.0s)]
*  It's about who were the Oscar winners when we were kids. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2127.0s)]
*  We're all fucking banger movies that everyone saw. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2130.0s)]
*  That everyone saw. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2132.0s)]
*  Best picture won best picture because it was best picture. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2133.0s)]
*  Not because it was the best picture about a trans social worker that got abducted in... [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2136.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Exactly. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2142.0s)]
*  Yeah, they got distorted. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2144.0s)]
*  They get distorted with what the job is. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2145.0s)]
*  The job is just to purely entertain people and with a great piece of work. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2147.0s)]
*  That's all it is. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2151.0s)]
*  That's the whole job. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2152.0s)]
*  And that could be pulp fiction. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2153.0s)]
*  There's no message in pulp fiction. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2155.0s)]
*  There's none. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2157.0s)]
*  It's fucking chaos. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2158.0s)]
*  And it's amazing. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2160.0s)]
*  The message we took away was that white guys can say the n-word. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2162.0s)]
*  I guess. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2165.0s)]
*  We were like, all right. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2166.0s)]
*  As long as you have a gun in your hand, you can do it. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2167.0s)]
*  But the whole movie is just madness. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2170.0s)]
*  But it's amazing. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2174.0s)]
*  You can't deny how great it is. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2176.0s)]
*  That's supposed to be what the best movie is. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2178.0s)]
*  It's not supposed to be... [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2181.0s)]
*  I don't even know if that won best film. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2183.0s)]
*  Did it win best film? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2185.0s)]
*  Did pulp fiction win best picture? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2186.0s)]
*  No, but I think he won best director and best... [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2188.0s)]
*  Maybe after that. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2190.0s)]
*  It should have won best picture. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2191.0s)]
*  Him and Roger Avery together were fucking gangsters. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2193.0s)]
*  That was a really good year. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2196.0s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2198.0s)]
*  We actually talked about that on the podcast. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2199.0s)]
*  I think it was actually Unforgiven that year, but I'm going to make sure. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2200.0s)]
*  Unforgiven was a fucking great movie. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2203.0s)]
*  Fucking great movie. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2205.0s)]
*  God. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2206.0s)]
*  That was Clint Eastwood going back and cleaning up all his old westerns. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2207.0s)]
*  That's what that movie was. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2211.0s)]
*  Let me show you what it was probably really like. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2212.0s)]
*  What it was really like. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2214.0s)]
*  Not this fucking everybody's looking at you sideways. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2216.0s)]
*  Wah, wah, wah. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2220.0s)]
*  Wah, wah, wah. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2222.0s)]
*  No, the reality was that character that he played. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2224.0s)]
*  That old assassin. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2228.0s)]
*  What year do you think movies stopped being great movies and started being... [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2230.0s)]
*  What year did we switch? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2234.0s)]
*  I think people are still making great movies. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2236.0s)]
*  But they're not winning Oscars. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2238.0s)]
*  Well, I think who cares? [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2239.0s)]
*  I really do. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2241.0s)]
*  I think once Will Smith slapped Chris Rock, the Oscars to me were like, what? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2242.0s)]
*  I'm done. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2246.0s)]
*  I'm done. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2248.0s)]
*  And then they all applauded him and gave him a standing ovation afterwards when he won an Oscar. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2249.0s)]
*  I'm done. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2253.0s)]
*  Forrest Gump. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2255.0s)]
*  Forrest Gump was a banger. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2256.0s)]
*  I saw every movie on there. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2258.0s)]
*  Shawshank Redemption? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2260.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2261.0s)]
*  I saw every movie on there. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2262.0s)]
*  Quiz Show? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2263.0s)]
*  Quiz Show was great. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2264.0s)]
*  I never saw four winnings in a funeral. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2265.0s)]
*  I thought it was great though. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2267.0s)]
*  Dude, it made you want to date a fucking British chick. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2268.0s)]
*  I made you want to have a rich friend, live in a castle, get drunk, watch a friend die, and fucking... [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2270.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2275.0s)]
*  But that makes sense that that was the best film. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2276.0s)]
*  What an amazing year. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2280.0s)]
*  Shawshank, Pulp Fiction, Quiz Show was fucking great. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2282.0s)]
*  By the way, that was a real thing. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2287.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2290.0s)]
*  Yeah, they really fucking rigged a quiz show. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2291.0s)]
*  That's why there's all sorts of rules if you're running a game show. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2293.0s)]
*  Because I was on a game show, Fear Factor. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2297.0s)]
*  It was my best way to get people away from me. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2299.0s)]
*  If they asked me, how do I get on Fear Factor? [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2302.0s)]
*  I go, if you want to get on, you can't even talk to me. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2305.0s)]
*  Because if you talk to me, then although I've previously known you, then it could be seen that I helped you get on the show. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2307.0s)]
*  So I can't talk to you. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2312.0s)]
*  It was great. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2313.0s)]
*  It's a great workaround. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2314.0s)]
*  It was great. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2316.0s)]
*  And it was true. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2317.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2318.0s)]
*  Did they have someone really judging the horse sperm? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2319.0s)]
*  Judging it? [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2324.0s)]
*  Like an official officiating it because it was prize money? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2325.0s)]
*  Meaning like the quiz show was all about them breaking the rules. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2330.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2335.0s)]
*  And you had to have someone, a standards and practice guy on your team, making sure the game was fair for everyone, correct? [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2336.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think there was something like that. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2341.0s)]
*  I think, I guess the network just did that. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2343.0s)]
*  I think we kind of ran the idea or they ran the ideas by the network and the network decided, you know, whether or not this was fair or what, what have you. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2346.0s)]
*  But everything was always fair. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2355.0s)]
*  Like that show was, you know, nobody got knowledge of the stunt before they got there. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2357.0s)]
*  We blindfolded everybody. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2362.0s)]
*  They were traveling around in vans. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2363.0s)]
*  There would be blindfolds. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2365.0s)]
*  Sometimes they cover their ears so they couldn't even hear. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2366.0s)]
*  And then they would take their blindfolds off. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2369.0s)]
*  And then right there and then they would find out what they had to do. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2371.0s)]
*  So right there and then they find out they got to get covered in snakes or something like that. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2374.0s)]
*  And we knew that someone had a fear of snakes because you fill out a form. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2378.0s)]
*  You know, if you got a fear of snakes, guess what? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2382.0s)]
*  You might wind up on the snake episode. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2385.0s)]
*  You know, it was a fucking crazy show. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2387.0s)]
*  But you know, it was all fair. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2390.0s)]
*  But that quiz show, they, you know, they figured it out like the mob figured out the fucking lottery. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2393.0s)]
*  You know, Whitey Bulger won the lottery twice. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2398.0s)]
*  Did he really? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2401.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2402.0s)]
*  You know, you have to be a gangster in South Boston and not just win the lottery once, but win the lottery twice. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2403.0s)]
*  Like, see, you can find that. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2411.0s)]
*  How do you rig the numbers that big? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2413.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2417.0s)]
*  You can kind of get away with stuff before the Internet. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2418.0s)]
*  Before the Internet, you could get away with things like that. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2422.0s)]
*  You could kind of rig the lottery a couple of times and everybody's like, Whitey won again? [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2424.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2428.0s)]
*  Oh, that's great. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2431.0s)]
*  When I was a kid and I was living in Boston, I used to teach one of his hitmen. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2433.0s)]
*  I taught one of his hitmen Taekwondo. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2438.0s)]
*  What's it like teaching a hitman? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2442.0s)]
*  It was weird. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2444.0s)]
*  Are they good students? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2445.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was very, very disciplined. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2446.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2448.0s)]
*  He was like a known, he was a known guy in the South Boston Irish mob. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2449.0s)]
*  And you wanted to learn how to fight. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2456.0s)]
*  A lottery winner had been one of Bulger's brilliant schemes to launder his drug extortion loan sharking money back in the summer, which makes sense, right? [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2459.0s)]
*  What better way to why do you have a Cadillac? [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2467.0s)]
*  I won the fucking lottery. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2470.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2471.0s)]
*  We're clear. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2472.0s)]
*  So you could have all your shit. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2473.0s)]
*  So, millions lottery ticket have been purchased at the South Boston Liquor Mart by Michael Linsky, who was the brother of a Bulger underling named Patrick Linsky. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2474.0s)]
*  The FBI learned that once Whitey heard about the jackpot, he ordered the real winner to sign the ticket over with Whitey and two associates paying $2.3 million in cash for 50% of the winnings. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2486.0s)]
*  Bulger himself paid Linsky $700,000, although Linsky lost money in the deal. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2496.0s)]
*  He really had no choice. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2502.0s)]
*  He came down to selling the ticket or risking his life. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2503.0s)]
*  Kevin Weeks, whose name also appeared in the winning lottery, the winning ticket later claimed that Linsky purchased a large batch of tickets to hand out as Christmas gifts and promised to split any winnings with Bulger and Weeks. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2506.0s)]
*  But Weeks' story makes little sense. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2518.0s)]
*  The so-called Christmas gifts were purchased during the dog days of summer. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2520.0s)]
*  So they did it. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2525.0s)]
*  The scams set up a 20 year legitimate income stream for Whitey where he earned $119,000 each year. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2526.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2534.0s)]
*  Yeah. So that's what he did. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2535.0s)]
*  He found out that somebody won it. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2536.0s)]
*  He's totally tuned into the neighborhood. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2538.0s)]
*  Find that guy, fuck him over, take his ticket. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2540.0s)]
*  Look, I won the lottery. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2542.0s)]
*  And you have no choice. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2544.0s)]
*  It's just like when the guy hit Gotti's grandson with the car. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2545.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2549.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're dead. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2550.0s)]
*  Yeah, you got to die now. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2551.0s)]
*  You're dead. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2552.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2553.0s)]
*  If you lived in that that time, like in the 1980s, when I used to teach this guy Taekwondo, like you would always hear about hits. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2554.0s)]
*  I knew a guy who got arrested. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2562.0s)]
*  I don't know if he did it. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2564.0s)]
*  He was a guy that I was friends with. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2566.0s)]
*  His name was Richie. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2569.0s)]
*  I was friends with him before he went to jail. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2571.0s)]
*  And then I was kind of friends with them when he got out of jail before I realized that he was like very dangerous now. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2573.0s)]
*  He was a completely different person. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2580.0s)]
*  So he went away to jail. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2582.0s)]
*  He was a little older than me. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2584.0s)]
*  I was 18. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2586.0s)]
*  So he was probably 20 or 21 and went to jail on some some kind of gun charge or drug charge. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2587.0s)]
*  So he comes out of jail a few years later and he's an animal. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2593.0s)]
*  I mean, an animal. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2599.0s)]
*  He's way bigger. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2601.0s)]
*  He's he's put on like 30 pounds of muscle and he's seen way too much. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2602.0s)]
*  He was telling me stories about fights that he used to get into in the jail where he beat some guy half to death with a broom handle and that you're fighting for your life in there. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2609.0s)]
*  It's like every day you're fighting for. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2619.0s)]
*  And he knew how to fight. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2621.0s)]
*  He was, you know, I trained with him. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2622.0s)]
*  That's where I knew him. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2623.0s)]
*  I knew him from Taekwondo. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2624.0s)]
*  And he was just telling me about fights. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2626.0s)]
*  He was getting jails like you have to fight. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2628.0s)]
*  There's nothing you could do. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2630.0s)]
*  It's constant. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2631.0s)]
*  You're constantly on edge. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2633.0s)]
*  I'm like, fuck, man. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2634.0s)]
*  And so I had known this guy before jail. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2636.0s)]
*  Then I known him after jail. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2638.0s)]
*  And he was just way more dangerous after jail. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2639.0s)]
*  He was doing a lot of coke. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2642.0s)]
*  He would train. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2644.0s)]
*  And when you would train with him, it was a fight. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2645.0s)]
*  I mean, it was a fight. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2648.0s)]
*  It wasn't you were fighting for your life. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2650.0s)]
*  You know, I broke his whole face once. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2652.0s)]
*  I hit him with a wheel kick in the head because we were fighting. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2656.0s)]
*  I mean, we were fighting. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2659.0s)]
*  We were. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2660.0s)]
*  And there was no one there, by the way. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2661.0s)]
*  It was my gym. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2662.0s)]
*  So it's just me and him like literally fighting. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2663.0s)]
*  He would just attack you. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2665.0s)]
*  Like it wasn't like a technical sparring thing. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2667.0s)]
*  And back then, I felt like I was a pussy if I didn't spar with anybody who wanted to spar. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2669.0s)]
*  Like, you want to spar? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2674.0s)]
*  OK, let's spar. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2675.0s)]
*  So you sparred with everybody. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2676.0s)]
*  And some people you sparred with. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2677.0s)]
*  Some people you were like, let's just not hurt each other. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2679.0s)]
*  And then other people you knew you were fighting. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2682.0s)]
*  You were a bomb. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2685.0s)]
*  Guys get knocked out all the time. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2687.0s)]
*  I saw dozens of guys get knocked out in the gym all the time. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2689.0s)]
*  I did a lot of it. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2693.0s)]
*  It was scary. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2694.0s)]
*  It was scary. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2695.0s)]
*  You would be super nervous before class. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2696.0s)]
*  You'd be super. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2698.0s)]
*  You'd have that. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2699.0s)]
*  And you're doing class every day. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2700.0s)]
*  That's happening every day. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2701.0s)]
*  All the time. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2702.0s)]
*  I would be. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2703.0s)]
*  I have anxiety. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2704.0s)]
*  I have anxiety getting on planes. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2705.0s)]
*  You're sparring three or four days a week. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2706.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're sparring three or four days a week. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2708.0s)]
*  If you're smart, you have to stay sharp. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2711.0s)]
*  So you broke this guy's face? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2714.0s)]
*  Broke his face and he wanted to keep training. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2715.0s)]
*  He was still coming after me. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2717.0s)]
*  I was like, dude, you got to look in the mirror. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2719.0s)]
*  Look in the mirror. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2721.0s)]
*  And his whole face shifted. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2722.0s)]
*  I hit him with a wheel kick in the cheek. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2724.0s)]
*  He went out. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2727.0s)]
*  His eyes rolled back in his head. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2728.0s)]
*  He collapses down to his butt. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2730.0s)]
*  And then he tried to get back up slowly. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2732.0s)]
*  He gets back up. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2734.0s)]
*  And he's like, I'm good. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2735.0s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2736.0s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2737.0s)]
*  And then like 30 seconds later, he wants to keep sparring. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2738.0s)]
*  And I'm like, you got to stop. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2740.0s)]
*  But he was just a monster, like a savage, like a savage person. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2742.0s)]
*  He was a kid when I knew him, like a normal kid. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2747.0s)]
*  Like, what's up, Brutti? [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2750.0s)]
*  And then three or four years later, whatever it was when he got out, he was a monster. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2751.0s)]
*  Was there any hint of the old Richie where you could go, hey, man, what's going on? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2755.0s)]
*  No. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2759.0s)]
*  He was just gone. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2760.0s)]
*  No, he was gone. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2761.0s)]
*  The old, well, I didn't know the old Richie that well. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2762.0s)]
*  Now I'm thinking timeline. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2764.0s)]
*  So this was pre me doing standup. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2765.0s)]
*  So I probably met him first when I was like 16. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2769.0s)]
*  And then I met him again when I was 21. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2774.0s)]
*  It was somewhere around that, 20, 21. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2777.0s)]
*  Because that's when I stopped fighting. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2780.0s)]
*  And it was like right around the same time where I knew Richie, when I stopped fighting. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2781.0s)]
*  So he got arrested. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2785.0s)]
*  There was a guy who was murdered and they broke every bone in his body with a hammer. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2787.0s)]
*  And they kept injecting him with cocaine to keep him alive. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2795.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2801.0s)]
*  Holy fuck. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2802.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2803.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2804.0s)]
*  They identified the body. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2805.0s)]
*  I forget how they identified the body, but I'm pretty sure they chopped his hands and his head off. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2807.0s)]
*  And they found this guy and he got arrested for that. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2812.0s)]
*  And he got away. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2816.0s)]
*  He got off. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2817.0s)]
*  I don't think they charged him. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2818.0s)]
*  I don't think he actually did it. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2819.0s)]
*  But he definitely knew people who did it. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2821.0s)]
*  He was involved with the same kind of people. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2823.0s)]
*  And this is like one of the guys that I worked out with. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2826.0s)]
*  But he wasn't the hit man. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2828.0s)]
*  The hit man was way more stoic. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2829.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2831.0s)]
*  Older? [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2832.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was older. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2833.0s)]
*  He was in his 30s. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2834.0s)]
*  And the hit man was... [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2835.0s)]
*  Would he come in with hit man problems? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2837.0s)]
*  Like, all right, say I'm in a restaurant. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2839.0s)]
*  He asked me once how would I kill a guy. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2841.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2843.0s)]
*  He said, if you're going to hit a guy and you were going to kill him, where would you hit him? [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2844.0s)]
*  And I said, probably the neck. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2847.0s)]
*  And he said, yeah, I think so. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2849.0s)]
*  And that was the conversation. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2852.0s)]
*  That was the end of the conversation. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2853.0s)]
*  I don't even know why I picked the neck because the neck actually could take a pretty good beating. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2854.0s)]
*  That's pretty tough. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2858.0s)]
*  Not mine. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2859.0s)]
*  Your head is way weaker than your neck. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2860.0s)]
*  This is really weak. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2862.0s)]
*  This little spot right here, your temple, this little tiny thin little layer of bone there that protects your brain. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2863.0s)]
*  It's not big at all. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2869.0s)]
*  When was the last time you got punched? [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2870.0s)]
*  Oh, it's been a long time. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2872.0s)]
*  I haven't sparred at all since like 2007 or eight. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2873.0s)]
*  Like sparring? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2877.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2878.0s)]
*  Kickboxing sparring? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2879.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2880.0s)]
*  It's too... [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2881.0s)]
*  Even little sparring wears on you. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2882.0s)]
*  You carry that for your whole life. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2885.0s)]
*  Just thuds, little thuds. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2887.0s)]
*  Even ones that aren't that hard. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2889.0s)]
*  Just a jab, just a thud. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2891.0s)]
*  You carry those. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2893.0s)]
*  Like those are real. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2894.0s)]
*  That's brain damage. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2895.0s)]
*  Those little times they get dinged in the gym. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2896.0s)]
*  That's real. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2899.0s)]
*  That's brain damage. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2900.0s)]
*  That's brain damage. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2901.0s)]
*  And like I told you, like when I was a kid, we did a lot of brain damage. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2902.0s)]
*  Sparring was horrible. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2906.0s)]
*  I've had, I think, eight concussions. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2908.0s)]
*  And I'm just a kid. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2910.0s)]
*  I didn't even spar. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2912.0s)]
*  I'm just talking like basketball camp one time, football. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2913.0s)]
*  I play in football for the Hurt Bird shit. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2918.0s)]
*  I got knocked unconscious. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2920.0s)]
*  Like I've probably had eight concussions, I'm guessing. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2922.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2925.0s)]
*  I've had a lot. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2926.0s)]
*  My last one was just a couple of years ago. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2927.0s)]
*  Skiing. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2929.0s)]
*  Last time skiing. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2930.0s)]
*  I just talked to you the other day when you were skiing. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2931.0s)]
*  And I thought you didn't ski because of your knees. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2933.0s)]
*  Well, my knee did get... [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2936.0s)]
*  I did fracture one of the bones in the top of my tibia. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2939.0s)]
*  No, which one's the... [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2947.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2948.0s)]
*  The tibia and then the fibula is the little one, right? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2949.0s)]
*  Fibula's in the shin, right? [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2951.0s)]
*  Yeah, I cracked the tibia. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2952.0s)]
*  But that healed. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2954.0s)]
*  But the real problem was the head. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2955.0s)]
*  My head, I fell on my head. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2957.0s)]
*  My skis went up in the air and I hit the ground head first. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2960.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2964.0s)]
*  Helmet? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2965.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2966.0s)]
*  But it was a bang. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2968.0s)]
*  Like I got rocked. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2969.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh shit. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2970.0s)]
*  Like that was a big one. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2972.0s)]
*  And then the rest of the day I was like dizzy. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2973.0s)]
*  My balance was all bad. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2975.0s)]
*  It was not good. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2977.0s)]
*  It was not good. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2978.0s)]
*  And then I was like, I'm done with this skiing thing. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2979.0s)]
*  Because I was always worried about my knees. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2981.0s)]
*  Because I still love doing martial arts. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2983.0s)]
*  And if I'm not doing it, I don't feel good. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2986.0s)]
*  Like I like to hit the back. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2988.0s)]
*  I like to have my joints work perfectly. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2990.0s)]
*  I like to have my skills still there. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2994.0s)]
*  I like to do it. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2996.0s)]
*  It's fun to do. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2997.0s)]
*  So anything that takes that away from me, like, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=2998.0s)]
*  ugh, skiing just for a thrill? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3000.0s)]
*  Like wee. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3002.0s)]
*  Oh, and once you get hurt, once you get hurt, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3003.0s)]
*  once you break, I was, we did a concrete sled competition [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3006.0s)]
*  in Calgary or in Edmonton. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3010.0s)]
*  Concrete sled? [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3012.0s)]
*  Concrete sled. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3013.0s)]
*  It's an engineering team. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3014.0s)]
*  And they have to figure out a way to build a concrete sled [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3016.0s)]
*  that makes it down a mountain with all the team members on it [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3018.0s)]
*  and stops within the right area. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3021.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3023.0s)]
*  And dude, people get fucked up. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3024.0s)]
*  I mean, fucked up. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3027.0s)]
*  A concrete sled must be so heavy. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3028.0s)]
*  You can find a picture of it. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3030.0s)]
*  You can find a picture of it. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3032.0s)]
*  It's like typing University of Edmonton concrete sled. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3033.0s)]
*  I think that's what it's called. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3037.0s)]
*  And right before, right before... [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3039.0s)]
*  This is why people keep themselves occupied [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3042.0s)]
*  when they're so fucking bored, [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3044.0s)]
*  because it's 38 degrees below zero outside. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3046.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3048.0s)]
*  And dude, that's the coldest I've ever been. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3049.0s)]
*  My fingers. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3051.0s)]
*  You see those concrete sleds? [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3052.0s)]
*  There's one where the guys get fucked up so bad. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3053.0s)]
*  I don't want to see it. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3056.0s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3057.0s)]
*  But the guy, the team that went right before me, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3058.0s)]
*  they flipped. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3060.0s)]
*  Flipped, ragdolled, yard sailed everywhere. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3061.0s)]
*  If these people tried bow hunting, they would quit this. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3063.0s)]
*  They'd quit all this. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3066.0s)]
*  They wouldn't be doing any of this. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3067.0s)]
*  This is ridiculous. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3069.0s)]
*  You could fucking die. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3070.0s)]
*  Oh, a guy before me broke his femur. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3072.0s)]
*  And I remember the guy, the kid, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3075.0s)]
*  the little stoner with the walkie that tells us, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3077.0s)]
*  all right, you guys are next. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3079.0s)]
*  He goes, what's that? [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3080.0s)]
*  Broken femur. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3081.0s)]
*  And he looks at me and he goes, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3082.0s)]
*  broken femur's a game changer. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3083.0s)]
*  And I was like, I got to go next. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3084.0s)]
*  Like, what the fuck? [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3086.0s)]
*  Like, that was terrifying. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3087.0s)]
*  But yeah, I think about that sometimes. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3089.0s)]
*  Just having my elbow surgery, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3092.0s)]
*  I gained so much weight from just having one arm [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3094.0s)]
*  because I couldn't get on the treadmill. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3098.0s)]
*  I couldn't do anything. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3099.0s)]
*  That I go, any injury is like, I don't want any injury. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3100.0s)]
*  Yeah, and injuries are not good. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3103.0s)]
*  And this is coming from a person who's had a bunch of surgeries. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3105.0s)]
*  I've had three knee surgeries, had my nose operated on. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3108.0s)]
*  Oh, let me tell you my game changer, mouth tape. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3112.0s)]
*  You were talking about this. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3117.0s)]
*  Game changer. Game changer. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3119.0s)]
*  I know people say this, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3123.0s)]
*  and I know it's like one of those fucking fitness influencer things [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3124.0s)]
*  where people are selling something. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3128.0s)]
*  I got no skin in the game, okay? [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3130.0s)]
*  I'm not selling nothing. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3132.0s)]
*  I don't have anything for sale. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3133.0s)]
*  I use a company called Hostage Tape. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3134.0s)]
*  I'm sure there's other ones that are great, [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3136.0s)]
*  but the Hostage Tape makes me laugh. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3138.0s)]
*  It's, you take this tape and you put it over your mouth when you sleep. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3140.0s)]
*  Now, I have sleep apnea, so I wear a mouthpiece. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3145.0s)]
*  And my mouthpiece has a tongue depressor. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3147.0s)]
*  So the mouthpiece is fitted to my lower jaw, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3149.0s)]
*  and the tongue depressor keeps my tongue from falling back on my throat. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3152.0s)]
*  So I don't block my airway, because I have a big tongue. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3156.0s)]
*  And I have a fat neck. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3160.0s)]
*  So it's like the air hole, it gets clogged up by the tongue. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3161.0s)]
*  So the tongue depressor works, and then I put the tape over my mouth. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3164.0s)]
*  So I'm not using my mouth at all. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3169.0s)]
*  Thank God I got my nose fixed in like 15 years ago or something like that. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3171.0s)]
*  Best decision I ever made in my life. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3177.0s)]
*  Best decision I've ever made. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3179.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3180.0s)]
*  One of the best. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3181.0s)]
*  Is that the one where you had to like pull shit out of your nose? [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3182.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3184.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was on the road with Tommy, and I would show him the boogers, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3185.0s)]
*  and he would like almost vomit, because the boogers were insane. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3189.0s)]
*  So once you get your nose operated on, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3195.0s)]
*  I had probably 12 nose breaks, maybe more, by the time I got my nose operated on. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3197.0s)]
*  So the inside of it was all calcified. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3206.0s)]
*  Like all the inside, just like cauliflower ear, that was the inside of my nose. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3209.0s)]
*  Like it was all just clogged. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3213.0s)]
*  I spoke like my nose was stuffed. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3216.0s)]
*  This was how my voice was. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3218.0s)]
*  Wait, hold on. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3219.0s)]
*  Is this, because I heard, I listened to a version of your voice when you were younger. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3220.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3226.0s)]
*  And it sounds totally different. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3227.0s)]
*  It's also getting older, your voice definitely deeper. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3228.0s)]
*  So that's me with the- [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3230.0s)]
*  Wait, that's you? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3232.0s)]
*  Yeah, when I got the nose plugs. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3233.0s)]
*  So that's after the operation. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3234.0s)]
*  So that's it right there. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3236.0s)]
*  Oh my God, look how big your nose is. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3239.0s)]
*  Well, it's all swollen right there. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3241.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3242.0s)]
*  Anyway, so if you have a deviated septum, I can't recommend it enough. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3243.0s)]
*  It's such a huge thing to do. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3249.0s)]
*  It opens up your nose, and you get like 10% more cardio. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3251.0s)]
*  My jujitsu changed totally. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3255.0s)]
*  Like my gas and jujitsu was way better. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3257.0s)]
*  I was like, this is crazy. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3261.0s)]
*  Why didn't I do this a long time ago? [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3262.0s)]
*  Breathing through your nose and not your mouth? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3264.0s)]
*  No, because you breathe through both. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3265.0s)]
*  So you have more airs coming in. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3267.0s)]
*  This is how you tell if you have a deviated septum. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3269.0s)]
*  Put a mirror underneath, take your phone and do a video, and then breathe through your nose. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3270.0s)]
*  And if it closes, like mine shuts. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3275.0s)]
*  And that's, they showed that to me. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3278.0s)]
*  Yeah, you have a deviated septum for sure. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3280.0s)]
*  You know what happens to me when I sleep. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3282.0s)]
*  My fucking goozle swells up. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3284.0s)]
*  Yeah, you were telling me. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3286.0s)]
*  It's the fucking worst. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3287.0s)]
*  Yeah, we were trying to decide where the tonsils were, and you were explaining the tonsils are actually on the side. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3288.0s)]
*  And your wife was calling it a goozle. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3293.0s)]
*  She had a redneck. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3295.0s)]
*  She goes, this goozle got swallowed in. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3296.0s)]
*  That little thing, whatever the word is, the technical word. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3298.0s)]
*  It's a uvula. It's uveolytis. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3300.0s)]
*  So I put the mouthpiece in, and then I tape up my mouth. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3302.0s)]
*  I get no uveolytis if I had mouth tape in. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3306.0s)]
*  Yeah, so this is the thing. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3308.0s)]
*  I don't snore at all anymore. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3309.0s)]
*  Zero snoring. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3311.0s)]
*  Like I'm silent when I sleep. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3312.0s)]
*  No sleep mask. Appneas. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3314.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no. I don't have anything. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3315.0s)]
*  I don't believe in this. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3317.0s)]
*  But I woke up the first day I did it, and I was like, holy shit. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3318.0s)]
*  I feel so much better. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3322.0s)]
*  Like instantaneously noticed a difference. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3324.0s)]
*  Like I was like 30% more rested. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3326.0s)]
*  Something like that. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3328.0s)]
*  Like just like a significant number where I could like feel it. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3329.0s)]
*  I was like, whoa. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3333.0s)]
*  And I've been doing it that way for like a week now. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3335.0s)]
*  So if I put those nose strips on, because I can breathe through my nose if I have a... [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3337.0s)]
*  You should get your nose operated on. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3340.0s)]
*  No fucking way. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3342.0s)]
*  Dude, I have a hernia. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3343.0s)]
*  It's not that big a deal. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3344.0s)]
*  You should get that done too. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3345.0s)]
*  No. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3346.0s)]
*  Yeah, you should. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3347.0s)]
*  It's the worst. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3348.0s)]
*  Your guts are going to poke out of your stomach. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3349.0s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3350.0s)]
*  They already do, Joe. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3351.0s)]
*  That's gross. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3352.0s)]
*  No, I mean your guts, guts. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3353.0s)]
*  Not fat. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3354.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3355.0s)]
*  They do, Joe. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3356.0s)]
*  Do they poke out right now? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3357.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3358.0s)]
*  Ew, let me see. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3359.0s)]
*  No. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3360.0s)]
*  Show me. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3361.0s)]
*  Can you make it poke out? [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3362.0s)]
*  No, but if I go like... [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3363.0s)]
*  You can kind of see this. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3364.0s)]
*  Where's the hernia? [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3365.0s)]
*  It's called... [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3366.0s)]
*  It's like a fin. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3367.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3368.0s)]
*  I'll show you for real, and you'll see it. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3369.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3372.0s)]
*  I'm watching Bert do a sit-up, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3373.0s)]
*  Do you see this? [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3376.0s)]
*  Oh, that's scary, dude. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3377.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3378.0s)]
*  So that's a rip in the center of your stomach? [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3379.0s)]
*  I remember when it happened. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3382.0s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3383.0s)]
*  How long ago? [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3384.0s)]
*  Probably 12 years ago. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3385.0s)]
*  Oh my God, man. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3386.0s)]
*  I was doing a Tough Mudder. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3387.0s)]
*  Oh God. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3388.0s)]
*  And I had to pull myself up one of those half pipes. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3389.0s)]
*  And so I ran and I grabbed it, and I pulled and I pulled and I felt a tear. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3394.0s)]
*  And I was like, whoa. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3398.0s)]
*  And I was like, God, man, that fucking hurt. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3399.0s)]
*  What happened? [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3403.0s)]
*  And I was like, I'm fine. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3404.0s)]
*  And then like two, I want to say like two weeks later, I'm laying in bed with my wife, [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3405.0s)]
*  and I kind of lean up and I see it. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3410.84s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3413.0s)]
*  What's this? [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3414.0s)]
*  And then a bunch of dads get it. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3415.0s)]
*  Like some dudes get it when they just gain a lot of weight. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3418.0s)]
*  That's another way to get it. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3421.0s)]
*  But like I've never been that fat. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3422.0s)]
*  But Tommy, I think Tommy might have had one. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3424.0s)]
*  Or Eddie Bravo had two. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3428.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's elective. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3430.0s)]
*  Oh, he had to get it. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3432.0s)]
*  Eddie had to get it fixed. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3433.0s)]
*  My problem is I'd get it fixed, but then I'm afraid of the aftermath of the surgery of [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3434.0s)]
*  13 weeks of recovery of me not working out. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3438.0s)]
*  I'm gonna go fucking haywire. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3441.0s)]
*  You don't have to go haywire. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3442.0s)]
*  That's nonsense. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3443.0s)]
*  You should get it fixed. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3444.0s)]
*  You should get it fixed and get your nose fixed too. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3445.0s)]
*  Just get it fixed. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3447.0s)]
*  Just bite the bullet. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3448.0s)]
*  Don't live with a compromised body. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3449.0s)]
*  They know how to fix those things. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3451.0s)]
*  You should get it fixed. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3453.0s)]
*  Like the nose thing's giant. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3454.0s)]
*  Breathe out of your nose. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3456.0s)]
*  You change your fucking life. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3457.0s)]
*  I couldn't do yoga class. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3458.0s)]
*  The instructor, he would get mad at me. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3459.0s)]
*  He'd like, you have to breathe out of your nose. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3461.0s)]
*  I'm like, I don't have a nose. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3463.0s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3465.0s)]
*  Like it doesn't work. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3466.0s)]
*  My nose, I had like one quarter of one nostril. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3468.0s)]
*  That was the only thing that was open. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3472.0s)]
*  Oh, for real? [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3473.0s)]
*  Yeah, my right side was completely closed. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3474.0s)]
*  So it wasn't just deviated. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3476.0s)]
*  It was just... [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3477.0s)]
*  Well, Luke Rockhold, former UFC champion, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3478.0s)]
*  had a post that he did about his nose recently [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3481.0s)]
*  where they were like going through his nose [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3485.0s)]
*  with one of those cameras. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3487.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3489.0s)]
*  And so you could see like what's in there. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3490.0s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3491.0s)]
*  It says his is completely clogged up. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3492.0s)]
*  Like you hear Justin Gaethje talk, [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3494.0s)]
*  his nose is totally clogged up. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3496.0s)]
*  Like there's a lot of the... [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3498.0s)]
*  And Justin actually got his nose fixed. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3499.0s)]
*  And then he fought Max Holloway. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3501.0s)]
*  And I think that might have put it back again. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3503.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3506.0s)]
*  How long... [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3507.0s)]
*  What's the nose surgery? [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3508.0s)]
*  What's the... [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3509.0s)]
*  I was doing Jiu Jitsu six weeks later. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3510.0s)]
*  Okay, you're Joe and I'm Burt. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3511.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean six weeks later I was fine. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3514.0s)]
*  I didn't take any pain pills. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3517.0s)]
*  No, I wasn't... [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3519.0s)]
*  I mean, I was fine to roll, [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3521.0s)]
*  but I was fine fine the next day. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3523.0s)]
*  Yeah, I had to have those stupid fucking things [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3525.0s)]
*  in my nose for a while. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3527.0s)]
*  I forget how long that lasted. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3528.0s)]
*  But then when they pulled those out, [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3530.0s)]
*  I was good to go. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3531.0s)]
*  But the doctor... [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3532.0s)]
*  I remember this. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3533.0s)]
*  The doctor gave me two pain pill prescriptions. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3534.0s)]
*  He was insistent on giving me these pain pill prescriptions. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3536.0s)]
*  And I was like, okay. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3539.0s)]
*  I go, but it doesn't hurt now. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3541.0s)]
*  So is it going to hurt more later? [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3543.0s)]
*  And he's like, it might. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3545.0s)]
*  I go, but it might not, right? [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3546.0s)]
*  Like he goes, but you should have these. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3548.0s)]
*  Like he wanted to write me these pain pill prescriptions. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3550.0s)]
*  I was like, this is kind of creeping me out, man. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3553.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3555.0s)]
*  Because I had already known a bunch of people [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3556.0s)]
*  that had had pill problems back then. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3557.0s)]
*  But it was just weird that he wanted to write me two of them. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3559.0s)]
*  And I told him, I go, listen, I just had knee surgery [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3561.0s)]
*  a couple of months ago. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3564.0s)]
*  And I go, and I didn't... [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3565.0s)]
*  It wasn't even a couple of years ago, rather. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3567.0s)]
*  And I didn't take any pain medication. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3569.0s)]
*  I go, I don't like it. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3571.0s)]
*  I just did it. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3572.0s)]
*  I just had the surgery and then just dealt with the pain. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3573.0s)]
*  I'd rather deal with the pain than that feeling. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3576.0s)]
*  I don't like that feeling. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3578.0s)]
*  You know, I got ACL surgery like way back in the day. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3579.0s)]
*  And they gave me like Vicodins or one of those type of things. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3582.0s)]
*  Percocets or Vicodins. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3585.0s)]
*  I forget what it was. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3586.0s)]
*  But I remember feeling so stupid. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3588.0s)]
*  I was like, well, this is not for me. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3590.0s)]
*  Like whatever this is, I'd rather be in pain [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3592.0s)]
*  than have my fucking brain just filled with like cotton. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3594.0s)]
*  It just felt like it was just like clogged up. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3599.0s)]
*  Like it couldn't... [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3601.0s)]
*  It wouldn't work right. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3602.0s)]
*  Like, blah. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3603.0s)]
*  It was terrible. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3604.0s)]
*  Tommy and I like that. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3605.0s)]
*  But my doctor, he just wanted me to take these pills. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3607.0s)]
*  I think it's that... [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3611.0s)]
*  You know, you were talking to me about statins for a while. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3612.0s)]
*  And you were saying that... [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3614.0s)]
*  I don't know, you were saying or whatever I read was that it... [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3615.0s)]
*  These companies are getting... [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3618.0s)]
*  These doctors are getting paid out to get people on statins. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3619.0s)]
*  The companies are saying, you know, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3623.0s)]
*  get people on statins, we'll pay you out. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3625.0s)]
*  You know, and I think... [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3627.0s)]
*  Doctors get a variety of rewards on finding out. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3628.0s)]
*  They get a variety of rewards dependent upon how many people [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3631.0s)]
*  in their practice get vaccinated. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3634.0s)]
*  And if they lose a certain percentage, [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3636.0s)]
*  if they like have less than a certain percentage, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3638.0s)]
*  then they don't get payouts. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3640.0s)]
*  It's... [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3642.0s)]
*  There's some weird shit that's involved in medicine. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3643.0s)]
*  That's financial incentives that don't necessarily align up [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3647.0s)]
*  with, you know, your best health. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3650.0s)]
*  And I think that doctors profit off of providing people [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3653.0s)]
*  with pain pills, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3658.0s)]
*  especially when you have a legitimate reason [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3659.0s)]
*  to want to take pain pills. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3661.0s)]
*  But I really don't think you should take them. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3663.0s)]
*  At least I don't take... [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3665.0s)]
*  I just don't... [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3667.0s)]
*  I think if you have something horrible wrong with you [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3668.0s)]
*  and you're in agony all day, I totally understand. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3670.0s)]
*  But for a regular thing, like you hurt your back a little bit, [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3672.0s)]
*  so now you're on Oxycontin, like... [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3675.0s)]
*  That's what happened to me. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3677.0s)]
*  I got pretty much addicted to them. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3679.0s)]
*  So I fill up that waterfall. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3681.0s)]
*  They fucking get everybody, bro. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3682.0s)]
*  Do they get you? [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3684.0s)]
*  They get everybody. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3685.0s)]
*  It's... [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3686.0s)]
*  I can tell you the moment it happened was we had to go to dinner [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3687.0s)]
*  with my wife's friends and I didn't want to go [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3690.0s)]
*  and we weren't drinking. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3692.0s)]
*  And I remember thinking, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3694.0s)]
*  I wonder if I double up on my pain pills. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3695.0s)]
*  That'll get me through tonight. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3698.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3699.0s)]
*  And I did. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3700.0s)]
*  And man, it was an enjoyable fucking night. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3701.0s)]
*  And I smoked a little weed and I was fucking perfect. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3703.0s)]
*  The next morning I woke up and LeAnn found out. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3706.0s)]
*  We were going camping that weekend. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3709.0s)]
*  And I reached over to get my pills, [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3711.0s)]
*  because the first thing I did in bed, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3712.0s)]
*  grab a pill, pop a pill, lay there for a while. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3714.0s)]
*  I went over, my pills were gone, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3717.0s)]
*  and LeAnn was at the foot of the bed. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3718.0s)]
*  She goes, you're done, big boy. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3719.0s)]
*  And I was like... [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3720.0s)]
*  I go, hold on. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3721.0s)]
*  This is like negotiating, like junkie negotiating. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3722.0s)]
*  I go, hold on, baby, we're going camping. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3726.0s)]
*  We're going to be sleeping on the hard ground. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3728.0s)]
*  And she goes, nope. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3730.0s)]
*  She goes, get as much weed as you want. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3731.0s)]
*  Drink as much as you want. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3733.0s)]
*  Get through the pain that way. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3734.0s)]
*  These things are fucking poison. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3735.0s)]
*  They're scary. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3737.0s)]
*  They're scary because you don't even realize [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3738.0s)]
*  what you look like to other people. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3739.0s)]
*  We went to Hawaii with the family one time, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3741.0s)]
*  and we went to the Luau. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3743.0s)]
*  I wasn't drinking in Hawaii that trip for whatever reason. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3747.0s)]
*  But I was bummed at the Luau, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3750.0s)]
*  because I was like, everyone's getting these Mai Tais, [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3752.0s)]
*  and I'm drinking water. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3755.0s)]
*  And I looked, and this mom was clearly on oxys. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3757.0s)]
*  And you watched her not out at the table. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3760.0s)]
*  And there's, man, when you see something like that [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3762.0s)]
*  and you're not drinking, you're like, [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3765.0s)]
*  thank God I'm not fucking drinking. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3767.0s)]
*  I remember watching her not out, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3769.0s)]
*  and her whole family sees it. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3770.0s)]
*  And she's like... [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3772.0s)]
*  But dude, what percentage of this country [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3774.0s)]
*  is hooked on oxys right now? [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3776.0s)]
*  It's got to be like a scary percentage. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3778.0s)]
*  I bet it's, what do you think is more, oxys or Xanax? [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3781.0s)]
*  Xanax is like, Xanax is totally plausible. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3784.0s)]
*  Take a Xanax, you're gonna be fine. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3788.0s)]
*  My cardiologist, Dr. Gadan, shout out to Dr. Gadan, [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3790.0s)]
*  he's a big fan of yours. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3794.0s)]
*  But he told me, he said, I said something about Xanax, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3795.0s)]
*  and he goes, hey man, I'm your doctor, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3799.0s)]
*  don't ever fucking take those things. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3801.0s)]
*  I was like, really? [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3803.0s)]
*  He goes, this is the leading cause of dementia. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3804.0s)]
*  Do not take fucking Xanax. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3806.0s)]
*  Xanax is the leading cause of dementia? [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3808.0s)]
*  He told me, he said, he was like, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3809.0s)]
*  by the way, I apologize, Dr. Gadan, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3811.0s)]
*  give me a shout out, and he's like, [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3812.0s)]
*  that's not my exact words, Bert, god damn it. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3813.0s)]
*  Yeah, you might have fucked that up. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3815.0s)]
*  We might want to delete that. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3816.0s)]
*  No, he said, he said, your brain, [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3817.0s)]
*  it turns your brain to mush. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3818.0s)]
*  Well, it's definitely not good for your brain. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3820.0s)]
*  It's one of the most dangerous drugs to get off. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3822.0s)]
*  Oh, they won't admit you to rehab if you're on Benzos. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3824.0s)]
*  Like, we took a friend to rehab one time, [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3828.0s)]
*  and one question they ask, have you taken a Benzo [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3830.0s)]
*  in the last 24 hours? [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3832.0s)]
*  And he was like, yeah, and they're like, [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3833.0s)]
*  nope, can't take you. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3834.0s)]
*  They don't want to deal with it. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3835.0s)]
*  It is so dangerous to get off Benzos. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3836.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's one of the, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3839.0s)]
*  there's only a few things that people die [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3840.0s)]
*  if they get addicted to, and then you cut them off. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3842.0s)]
*  One of them is alcohol. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3845.0s)]
*  You know? [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3846.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3847.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3848.0s)]
*  I think you have to drink, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3849.0s)]
*  you have to drink like when you wake up. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3850.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, you have to be a complete drunk, [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3851.0s)]
*  and somehow or another, your body shifts into surviving, [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3853.0s)]
*  drinking alcohol all the time. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3857.0s)]
*  You're killing yourself for sure, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3859.0s)]
*  but your body relies on it. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3860.0s)]
*  I forget what the mechanism is, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3862.0s)]
*  but there's an actual mechanism, [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3863.0s)]
*  like there's some sort of a shift [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3865.0s)]
*  when your body's got so much alcohol, [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3866.0s)]
*  and then when you get off alcohol entirely, you can die. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3868.0s)]
*  Oh, you have a stroke? [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3871.0s)]
*  I don't know what the cause of death is, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3873.0s)]
*  but I know that Benzos is another drug that does that. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3875.0s)]
*  When you get off of it, you can die. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3878.0s)]
*  Like it's one of those things, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3881.0s)]
*  if you just cold turkey Benzos, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3882.0s)]
*  if you're popping Xanax all day long, [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3884.0s)]
*  and you're like, I'm done, like you can die. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3886.0s)]
*  It's crazy how clean life is when you're not partying. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3888.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3892.0s)]
*  Like you haven't drank in two weeks. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3893.0s)]
*  It's like amazing how the sky looks different, [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3895.0s)]
*  the trees look different. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3897.0s)]
*  Well, you have more energy. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3898.0s)]
*  So much. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3900.0s)]
*  The gym is night and day different. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3901.0s)]
*  Like I work out every day, regardless, [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3903.0s)]
*  ran five miles today, drank last night on the plane, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3905.0s)]
*  five miles today, and now I feel clean, [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3909.0s)]
*  but then I go, if I don't drink tonight, [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3912.0s)]
*  which I doubt I probably will, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3914.0s)]
*  I don't know what you're talking about. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3916.0s)]
*  Who are we lying to though? [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3918.0s)]
*  But like the next day, I feel like a million bucks. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3919.0s)]
*  You get me in the gym, and I want to be on the treadmill, [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3922.0s)]
*  and I get excited for fucking those sissy squats you do. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3924.0s)]
*  I love those bitches. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3927.0s)]
*  I got the board. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3929.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3931.0s)]
*  Get a fucking- [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3932.0s)]
*  Slam board squats. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3933.0s)]
*  Slam board squat, get a 45 fucking weight in my arms. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3934.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3936.0s)]
*  Do 15 of those bitches. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3937.0s)]
*  Those are great. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3938.0s)]
*  And you feel it, and you're like, that last one. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3939.0s)]
*  You know what my favorite squat to do is? [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3941.0s)]
*  What's the one where you lean back [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3943.0s)]
*  and you squat when you're tilted back? [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3946.0s)]
*  Squat, lean back? [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3949.0s)]
*  It's called bad form? [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3950.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3951.0s)]
*  His skull back injury waiting to happen. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3954.0s)]
*  Lean back and squat? [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3956.0s)]
*  That sounds crazy. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3957.0s)]
*  Like a landmine squat or something, [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3958.0s)]
*  where you have the pole, you have the- [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3960.0s)]
*  Oh, okay, yeah, landmine, yeah. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3962.0s)]
*  And you get deep into that bitch. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3964.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, those are great. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3966.0s)]
*  Those are great for rotational force, too. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3968.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3970.0s)]
*  You know, Viking shit, you know what I'm saying? [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3972.0s)]
*  I'm always impressed when a man can program his own workout. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3976.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3979.0s)]
*  Yeah, because I can't- [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3980.0s)]
*  You don't do your own workouts? [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3982.0s)]
*  No, I have a guy program for me. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3983.0s)]
*  He comes to my house and trains me every day. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3986.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3988.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3989.0s)]
*  Wow, so you don't work out on your own at all? [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3990.0s)]
*  If I work out on my own, I run. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3992.0s)]
*  Okay, so you must like that, right? [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3994.0s)]
*  When you get alone time, you must like that. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3996.0s)]
*  I love getting on the treadmill by myself [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=3998.0s)]
*  and just fucking going. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4000.0s)]
*  Yeah, alone time's big. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4002.0s)]
*  So that's what I like the most about working out by myself. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4004.0s)]
*  I can figure out what to do. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4009.0s)]
*  I know what to do. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4011.0s)]
*  So I just program my own shit. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4012.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's impressive. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4013.0s)]
*  There's so much shit to do. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4015.0s)]
*  I tell you what, the game changer for me in working out, [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4016.0s)]
*  and I think that, you know, I never understood [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4019.0s)]
*  guys like Cam or David Goggins, [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4023.0s)]
*  and then they push themselves so hard. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4025.0s)]
*  And when we did that bench press competition, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4027.0s)]
*  I realized most of the time when everyone works, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4029.0s)]
*  a regular person works out, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4032.0s)]
*  they just want to get through it and be done with it. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4033.0s)]
*  They're like, I know, I cheated a little bit, fuck it, that was 12. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4035.0s)]
*  But when you're training for something, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4038.0s)]
*  and this must be like this with mixed martial artists [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4039.0s)]
*  and with all those motherfuckers, [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4041.0s)]
*  you're training your body for an actual event [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4044.0s)]
*  to protect yourself from other men. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4048.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4050.0s)]
*  And I was like, and when I had a goal in mind, [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4051.0s)]
*  I was like, oh, this is different. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4053.0s)]
*  Like, I'm doing everything he's telling me to do, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4055.0s)]
*  and I'm doing it the right way, [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4057.0s)]
*  and I'm doing it to, like, failure, [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4059.0s)]
*  because I'm trained, if I know that if I do that, [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4061.0s)]
*  then when I get to the day where I do the bench, [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4063.0s)]
*  I can then complete the mission I'm set out to do. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4066.0s)]
*  Right, you've got a goal. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4068.0s)]
*  I think more goal-oriented workout, [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4069.0s)]
*  if they said, like, dude, just so you know, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4071.0s)]
*  a wolf's coming to your house in two weeks. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4073.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4075.0s)]
*  You know, we need to workout, get ready for that wolf. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4076.0s)]
*  You'd workout so hard for that fucking wolf. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4078.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah, I'd be like, fuck. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4080.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4082.0s)]
*  Dude, I tell you about my friend in Colorado, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4083.0s)]
*  they let wolves loose near his land. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4086.0s)]
*  No. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4088.0s)]
*  Yeah, they just let wolves loose in Colorado. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4089.0s)]
*  They let a bunch loose in one part of the state, [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4092.0s)]
*  and then they let a bunch more loose. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4096.0s)]
*  He said it was five, I don't know if that's accurate, [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4099.0s)]
*  but that's what he was told. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4102.0s)]
*  And, uh... [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4104.0s)]
*  For what purpose? [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4105.0s)]
*  Just they decided to repopulate the state with wolves, [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4106.0s)]
*  and they're getting wolves from, like, British Columbia, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4110.0s)]
*  so these big-ass fucking Canadian wolves [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4112.0s)]
*  are coming in fucking the elk up, [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4115.0s)]
*  and this is outside of Aspen, [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4118.0s)]
*  so these are, like, all these really wealthy people. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4120.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4122.0s)]
*  And they let wolves loose on their property. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4123.0s)]
*  And by the way, there's livestock there. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4125.0s)]
*  These people have cattle. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4127.0s)]
*  They have all sorts of... [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4128.0s)]
*  So far, the wolves in his area haven't attacked cattle [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4129.0s)]
*  because there's an abundance of elk up there. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4132.0s)]
*  It's a very... [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4135.0s)]
*  It's a big elk corridor where the elk migrate. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4136.0s)]
*  And I took a picture and posted it up on Instagram [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4139.0s)]
*  of an elk leg that he found [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4143.0s)]
*  just, like, within two weeks of them being released. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4145.0s)]
*  They had already started killing elk on his property. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4149.0s)]
*  So a wolf took out an elk and left the leg, [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4152.0s)]
*  left the leg bone just laying in the snow. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4155.0s)]
*  Wait, how many wolves did they let go? [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4159.0s)]
*  Five, he thinks. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4161.0s)]
*  This is what he told me. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4162.0s)]
*  Do they release them as a pack? [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4163.0s)]
*  I don't know if they will pack up. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4165.0s)]
*  I don't know if they knew each other before. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4168.0s)]
*  I don't know what the fucking neighborhood... [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4171.0s)]
*  Did they grow up together? [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4173.0s)]
*  Yeah. So that's what we found. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4174.0s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4176.0s)]
*  So that's an elk leg that's just been stripped down, [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4178.0s)]
*  the lower leg, no meat on it. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4182.0s)]
*  Just the hoof and some fur and shit. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4184.0s)]
*  Just laying in a bunch of disturbed areas. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4187.0s)]
*  It was all fucked up. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4190.0s)]
*  You could tell some shit went down. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4191.0s)]
*  So we found that piece there. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4193.0s)]
*  They had dragged that from somewhere else. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4195.0s)]
*  But there was a carcass up there, too. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4197.0s)]
*  So they basically can kill... [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4200.0s)]
*  They could probably kill one or two elk a day, [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4205.0s)]
*  and they probably will do that now. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4209.0s)]
*  And so the elk population will rapidly diminish. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4212.0s)]
*  The elk have no idea. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4215.0s)]
*  They've never evolved around wolves. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4217.0s)]
*  These elk are in, like, who knows how many generations [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4219.0s)]
*  with no wolves. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4224.0s)]
*  So the United States had wolves all throughout the West, [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4226.0s)]
*  and then they eradicated them because they fucking kill everything. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4229.0s)]
*  Because they kill livestock, they kill horses, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4232.0s)]
*  they pack up, they get big. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4234.0s)]
*  They get big packs, and then they devastate livestock. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4236.0s)]
*  Sheep herders, cattle. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4239.0s)]
*  So they all murdered all the wolves. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4241.0s)]
*  So now these people, these greenies, these little cutie pies, [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4243.0s)]
*  decided to bring back the most intelligent, [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4247.0s)]
*  telepathic apex predator that operates in packs. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4250.0s)]
*  And you decide to let them loose near a ski town. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4255.0s)]
*  Like, congratulations. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4259.0s)]
*  Why the fuck? [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4260.0s)]
*  Because they're cute. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4261.0s)]
*  Because these are people that grew up in cities, [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4262.0s)]
*  and they don't understand. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4264.0s)]
*  It's called ballot box biology. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4265.0s)]
*  It's a bunch of people who grew up in the city. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4268.0s)]
*  They don't know what the fuck they're doing, [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4270.0s)]
*  and they don't know what a wolf really is. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4272.0s)]
*  They just think, wildlife's amazing. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4274.0s)]
*  And then so you've let loose apex predators [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4276.0s)]
*  in an area where nothing is prepared for them. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4279.0s)]
*  These animals don't know to look for wolves. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4283.0s)]
*  They've never experienced a wolf before. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4285.0s)]
*  They don't have a natural instinct to run away when they see the wolves. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4287.0s)]
*  They don't know what the fuck is going on. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4292.0s)]
*  And then you've got cattle. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4294.0s)]
*  You can't tell wolves what to kill either. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4295.0s)]
*  Of course not. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4297.0s)]
*  Well, here's even better. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4298.0s)]
*  The first ones they got, so they had a mandate to get these. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4299.0s)]
*  Colorado voted. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4302.0s)]
*  They voted it to release wolves. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4303.0s)]
*  And so the governor had to get it done within a certain period of time. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4305.0s)]
*  And so they got wolves from Oregon that had been killing cattle. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4308.0s)]
*  So these wolves, they captured them because they had been killing cattle, [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4314.0s)]
*  and then they released them in Colorado where they, wait for it, [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4319.0s)]
*  started killing cattle. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4325.0s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4326.0s)]
*  Duh. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4327.0s)]
*  So wolves are awesome, [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4328.0s)]
*  but they were making their way into Colorado by themselves. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4330.0s)]
*  They were already coming down from Wyoming. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4333.0s)]
*  There's wolves in Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4335.0s)]
*  and they were making their way down naturally. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4338.0s)]
*  But these idiots decided to accelerate the process [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4340.0s)]
*  and introduce this completely new element outside of a fucking ski town [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4343.0s)]
*  that's going to kill people's dogs for sure. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4347.0s)]
*  If they get to a healthy population, [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4349.0s)]
*  you're never going to be able to let your dog go outside. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4351.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4353.0s)]
*  That's over. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4354.0s)]
*  Dead. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4355.0s)]
*  Everybody dead. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4356.0s)]
*  They're like 10 times worse than coyotes. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4357.0s)]
*  You remember coyotes just... [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4359.0s)]
*  They're giant coyotes. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4360.0s)]
*  You remember seeing coyotes jump fences? [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4361.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4362.0s)]
*  And you're like, [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4363.0s)]
*  there's no protecting my chickens from fucking coyotes. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4364.0s)]
*  I saw a coyote jump a fence with one of my chickens in its mouth. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4366.0s)]
*  Jumped a six-foot-high wrought iron fence like it was nothing. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4369.0s)]
*  Bound, touched the top of the fence with its feet, [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4373.0s)]
*  with a chicken in its mouth. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4376.0s)]
*  And right over the top, I was like, whoa. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4377.0s)]
*  I was so delusional. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4379.0s)]
*  I thought, oh, this fence is this big. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4381.0s)]
*  They can't get over that. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4383.0s)]
*  One jump. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4384.0s)]
*  One jump. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4385.0s)]
*  Feet to the top. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4386.0s)]
*  Other feet to the top. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4387.0s)]
*  Over the top with a chicken in its mouth. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4388.0s)]
*  All my neighbors have red lights on their fences. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4390.0s)]
*  That's the only thing that stops coyotes, I say. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4392.0s)]
*  Oh, they won't jump over a red light? [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4395.0s)]
*  I have no fucking idea. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4396.0s)]
*  But they all have like... [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4397.0s)]
*  It looks like a red bicycle light on every panel of their fence. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4398.0s)]
*  They're little monsters. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4402.0s)]
*  What state? [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4403.0s)]
*  They're wolves too, by the way. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4404.0s)]
*  They are? [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4405.0s)]
*  Coyotes are wolves. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4406.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're small wolves. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4407.0s)]
*  I remember... [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4408.0s)]
*  You know, it's funny, the little things you remember. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4409.0s)]
*  I remember you talking about the coyote's honeydicking your dog one time. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4410.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4413.0s)]
*  I always think that's the funniest phrase, honeydicking. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4414.0s)]
*  Yeah, they try to honeydick your dog. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4417.0s)]
*  So what they do is they... [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4419.0s)]
*  One coyote... [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4420.0s)]
*  I've told this story before, but I'll say it quick. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4421.0s)]
*  I went to this pet store that I used to go to. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4423.0s)]
*  And one of the guys that worked in the pet store, yeah, he was a veterinarian. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4427.0s)]
*  And he brought in... [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4432.0s)]
*  Someone had brought in this pit bull that was covered in cuts. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4434.0s)]
*  His whole body was like hundreds of stitches. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4438.0s)]
*  And he's like, what happened? [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4441.0s)]
*  And he was like, I don't know. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4442.0s)]
*  He got out. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4443.0s)]
*  And then, you know, when I came home, he was outside the fence. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4444.0s)]
*  And this is what he looked like. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4448.0s)]
*  So this guy, they stitched the dog up. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4449.0s)]
*  And then he follows a blood trail into the woods outside of his house where he finds [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4451.0s)]
*  nine dead coyotes. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4457.0s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4459.0s)]
*  So they honeydicked a giant pit bull. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4461.0s)]
*  Like one of them super jacked muscular pit bulls with a fucking fire hydrant head. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4464.0s)]
*  The kind that are on the front of rap albums. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4469.0s)]
*  Terrifying pit bull. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4471.0s)]
*  And this pit bull just killed everyone. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4472.0s)]
*  They fucked with the John Wick of pit bulls. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4475.0s)]
*  And he just killed them all. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4478.0s)]
*  Killed all the coyotes. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4480.0s)]
*  They were all just... [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4481.0s)]
*  He said it looked like Vietnam. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4482.0s)]
*  He said they were just torn apart. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4483.0s)]
*  Because once the dog killed him, he's not going to stop. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4485.0s)]
*  He's going to start shaking them. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4487.0s)]
*  You know, picking especially a pit bull like that that's in a blood rage to just kill, [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4489.0s)]
*  fight for its life. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4493.0s)]

*  These pit bulls just want to fight all the time. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4499.0s)]
*  I've been wanting to do this every fucking day I wake up. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4501.0s)]
*  He was so pumped. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4504.0s)]
*  It was the guy who had a jujitsu black belt and a drunk grab. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4505.0s)]
*  And he was like, thank you. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4508.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4510.0s)]
*  I've been practicing for this my whole life. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4511.0s)]
*  But you imagine the scene. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4514.0s)]
*  Imagine the scene just walking. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4517.0s)]
*  Just dead coyotes just ripped apart. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4519.0s)]
*  Just throats torn open. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4521.0s)]
*  Guts hanging out. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4523.0s)]
*  Legs broken. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4524.0s)]
*  Because this dog, if a dog like that bites a coyote's leg, that leg's broken. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4526.0s)]
*  That's a shattered leg. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4531.0s)]
*  That leg doesn't work anymore. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4532.0s)]
*  The poundage that pit bulls bite is fucking wild. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4534.0s)]
*  You know what a wolf is? [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4537.0s)]
*  It's like five times stronger. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4538.0s)]
*  Are you shitting me? [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4540.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4541.0s)]
*  That's how crazy these retards are that let loose these apex telepathic super predators into a ski town. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4542.0s)]
*  We're filled with super rich people. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4551.0s)]
*  And the super rich people right now are they're finding out about this. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4552.0s)]
*  They are freaking the fuck out. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4555.0s)]
*  I bet they are. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4557.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4558.0s)]
*  All my buddy who lives out there, all his neighbors, they're all trying to figure out what they can do. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4559.0s)]
*  You know, they're all collared too. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4563.0s)]
*  So there's an app and you can get on the app and find out where the monsters are. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4564.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4569.0s)]
*  You want to get scared? [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4570.0s)]
*  I want to get. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4571.0s)]
*  I got to get that. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4572.0s)]
*  How about you're walking? [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4573.0s)]
*  How about you're walking? [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4574.0s)]
*  And then you see the fucking app is showing you they're behind you. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4575.0s)]
*  All five of them behind you and you're with your family. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4581.0s)]
*  But maybe you voted on that because you think wolves are amazing. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4585.0s)]
*  That's Little Red Riding Hood, bro. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4590.0s)]
*  You can track these wolves on an app. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4592.0s)]
*  That's kind of cool. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4595.0s)]
*  It's kind of cool to know where the monsters are. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4596.0s)]
*  But they do that with sharks, great white sharks. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4598.0s)]
*  But these people in the neighborhood are all tracking these wolves. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4600.0s)]
*  So they're all freaking out because these wolves are like circling their homes, circling their property. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4603.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4608.0s)]
*  Some of them have gone right through fields with cattle and not done anything about it. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4609.0s)]
*  Yeah, they don't even understand why. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4614.0s)]
*  They haven't attacked any cattle yet. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4616.0s)]
*  But these are ones that are outside of Aspen. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4618.0s)]
*  So the ones that they brought in from Oregon, that's not outside of Aspen. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4621.0s)]
*  That's a different spot. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4625.0s)]
*  Those are the ones that were they were depredation tags. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4626.0s)]
*  They were they were already killing wildlife or they were killing cattle. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4629.0s)]
*  What state do you think has the most predators? [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4633.0s)]
*  Like Australia has the most predators in the country. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4636.0s)]
*  In our country. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4638.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'd say Alaska for sure. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4639.0s)]
*  Florida. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4641.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4642.0s)]

*  Florida is fucking crazy. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4644.0s)]
*  Florida for sure. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4645.0s)]
*  Florida now because you brought in reptiles. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4646.0s)]
*  Yeah, 100 percent. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4648.0s)]
*  Florida has more pythons in it in the Everglades than all the rest of the world. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4649.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4655.0s)]
*  Do you see those kids that go in? [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4656.0s)]
*  You see those kids that dive in and grab them? [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4657.0s)]
*  I have a python python cowboy on the show. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4659.0s)]
*  He brought me up. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4662.0s)]
*  Don't we have a python head laying around here somewhere? [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4663.0s)]
*  Something. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4665.0s)]

*  I don't know if this is because I'm from Florida, but I never put my hand into a hose bucket [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4730.0s)]
*  without kicking it a couple of times. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4734.0s)]
*  When you say I got my hose all wrapped up, I thought you had your ladies making money. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4735.0s)]
*  My hose doesn't make any money. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4739.0s)]
*  My hose is wrapped up. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4741.0s)]

*  Out here, we've had one. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4750.0s)]
*  One of my neighbors had a couple of coral snakes in her garage. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4754.0s)]
*  Those are scary. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4757.0s)]
*  Coral snakes are the ones that look like ... Red and black. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4758.0s)]
*  They're beautiful. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4761.0s)]
*  Black and yellow, kill a fellow. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4762.0s)]
*  Red and ... What is that? [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4764.0s)]
*  Red, white, and blue. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4766.0s)]
*  America. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4767.0s)]
*  He's cool. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4768.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4777.0s)]

*  Venom, lack. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4783.0s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4784.0s)]
*  There's no venom. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4785.0s)]
*  Oh, to help identify venomous coral snakes. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4787.0s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4790.0s)]
*  Some coral snakes are not venomous? [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4791.0s)]
*  No, it's a ... Oh, yeah. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4793.0s)]
*  That's what it looked like. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4794.0s)]
*  No, it's a king snake. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4795.0s)]
*  A scarlet king snake is harmless. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4797.0s)]
*  Coral snakes are deadly. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4799.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4800.0s)]
*  So we had both in Florida, I think. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4801.0s)]
*  So you never got near either of them. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4803.0s)]
*  But that ... Go back to that image, Jamie. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4805.0s)]
*  The one on the top, red touches yellow, kill a fellow. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4808.0s)]
*  That's it. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4811.0s)]
*  So that's the one that'll kill it. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4812.0s)]
*  Red touches black, scarlet king snake, harmless. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4814.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4818.0s)]
*  I'm not going to roll the dice on that. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4819.0s)]
*  I would not remember this. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4820.0s)]
*  I would fuck that up. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4821.0s)]
*  I'd be like, wait, black ... That looks like it will fucking for sure kill you. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4822.0s)]
*  Red touches black, step back. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4825.0s)]
*  What? [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4827.0s)]
*  Yellow, black and yellow. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4828.0s)]
*  Red touches yellow, kill a fellow. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4829.0s)]
*  That's the one. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4830.0s)]
*  That's all you have to remember. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4831.0s)]
*  Red touches yellow, kill a fellow. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4832.0s)]
*  Black and yellow, black and yellow. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4833.0s)]
*  That's red touches yellow. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4834.0s)]
*  Fuck that creature. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4835.0s)]
*  My friend, she had two of them in her garage. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4838.0s)]
*  Yeah, not good. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4841.0s)]
*  But my old house, my ... Remember, did you ever meet Frank? [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4843.0s)]
*  You never met Frank. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4847.0s)]
*  I used to have this pit bull named Frank Sinatra. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4848.0s)]
*  Frank would ... [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4852.0s)]
*  I only knew Johnny. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4853.0s)]
*  Frank killed everything. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4854.0s)]
*  Everything they got in that yard was dead. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4855.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4857.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was a psycho. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4858.0s)]
*  He would kill rattlesnakes all the time. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4859.0s)]
*  He'd get bit all the time. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4862.0s)]
*  I'm like, wait, how did he not get bit? [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4863.0s)]
*  He got bit every time. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4866.0s)]
*  I'd have to keep bringing him to the fucking vet. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4868.0s)]
*  I brought him to the vet at least three times. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4870.0s)]
*  One time I had to bring him twice because he had been bit by rattlesnakes so many times [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4872.0s)]
*  that he had developed some sort of an immunity. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4878.0s)]
*  I brought him the first time and we were at the vet. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4881.0s)]
*  He was super friendly. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4884.0s)]
*  He was the sweetest dog. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4885.0s)]
*  Loved everybody, but vicious with snakes and lizards. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4886.0s)]
*  Lizards are like his video game. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4890.0s)]
*  He would jump on the walls to try to get the lizards that were crawling on the walls. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4891.0s)]
*  He would leap into the air to try to get these lizards. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4895.0s)]
*  I brought him to the vet and the vet's like, I don't see a puncture mark and he's not swelling, [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4898.0s)]
*  so I wouldn't worry about it. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4904.0s)]
*  I'm like, wow, how the fuck did you kill that snake and not get bit? [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4905.0s)]
*  Then I brought him back to the house and then his fucking face immediately swole back up again. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4909.0s)]
*  Then I had to bring him back to the vet. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4915.0s)]
*  The vet's like, he's been stung. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4917.0s)]
*  He's been bit so many times that he probably has some sort of immunity. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4918.0s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4922.0s)]
*  It's a coral snake too that doesn't go by the rhyme. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4923.0s)]
*  That is so beautiful. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4926.0s)]
*  That is one of the most venomous snakes in the world. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4927.0s)]
*  I would assume that would fuck you up. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4929.0s)]
*  It kills king cobras apparently. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4931.0s)]
*  It kills king cobras. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4933.0s)]
*  Look how beautiful it is. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4934.0s)]
*  It's a Malaysian blue coral. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4935.0s)]
*  Somewhere there's some idiot in Florida in a death metal band that wants this. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4936.0s)]
*  He's going to have it in his house until he can't feed it anymore. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4940.0s)]
*  It's like, little fella, going to let you go. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4943.0s)]
*  He's going to let it loose and it's going to go in the fucking Everglades. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4945.0s)]
*  Then you're going to have a half a million of them there. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4948.0s)]
*  Slash had poisonous snakes in his house. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4950.0s)]
*  Of course he did. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4953.0s)]
*  Look at him. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4954.0s)]
*  Then there was an earthquake. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4955.0s)]
*  Oh, great. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4956.0s)]
*  I read that in one of their books where I talked to Slash once about it. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4957.0s)]
*  They got out? [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4960.0s)]
*  I think they got out and they had to send someone in the house to ... I can't remember exactly, [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4961.0s)]
*  but there was an earthquake and he had a cobra. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4965.0s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4967.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4968.0s)]
*  I understand wanting to have a snake, but poisonous snakes, I can't wrap my head around. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4969.0s)]
*  No. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4974.0s)]
*  No. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4975.0s)]
*  You can never touch it. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4976.0s)]
*  You can never play with it. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4977.0s)]
*  Fuck all snakes. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4978.0s)]
*  How about that? [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4979.0s)]
*  How about all that? [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4980.0s)]
*  How about snakes are the reason why we wear clothes? [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4981.0s)]
*  A snake tricked Eve into eating that fucking apple and now we're ruined. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4984.0s)]
*  All right? [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4989.0s)]
*  Now we have to have Jesus come save us. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4990.0s)]
*  Snakes. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4991.0s)]
*  You definitely look like you would have gone through a lizard phase though. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4992.0s)]
*  No. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4994.0s)]
*  Listen. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4995.0s)]
*  I had one idea that was the dumbest idea. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=4996.0s)]
*  The guy in cops. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5000.0s)]
*  The snake guy. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5002.0s)]
*  What is going on? [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5003.0s)]
*  The cop doesn't want to ... [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5004.0s)]
*  He's got snakes? [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5005.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5006.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5007.0s)]
*  This is the wrong cop to pull a snake out with. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5008.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5010.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5011.0s)]
*  You're right. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5012.0s)]
*  I'll stand right here. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5013.0s)]
*  Now wait a minute. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5014.0s)]
*  You don't understand how many there are. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5015.0s)]
*  Dude. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5016.0s)]
*  You see all them snakes right there? [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5017.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5018.0s)]
*  You see them snakes right there? [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5019.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5020.0s)]
*  They're my babies. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5021.0s)]
*  I care more about them snakes than I do a human life. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5022.0s)]
*  Just like that, man. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5027.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5029.0s)]
*  Them snakes mean more. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5030.0s)]
*  She's already out the door. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5031.0s)]
*  She's like, sure thing, buddy. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5032.0s)]
*  So I had this one idea once. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5035.0s)]
*  I had this house that had a center courtyard and I was going to seal off the center courtyard [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5039.5s)]
*  and get a crocodile monitor. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5047.2s)]
*  Bad ass fucking monitor. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5049.2s)]
*  And feed it rabbits and have a wild kingdom in the center of my house. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5052.0s)]
*  I love it. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5057.0s)]
*  So I was going to set up trees because it had open air. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5058.0s)]
*  So I was like, I'm going to set up a canopy, trap it in there like a greenhouse, make [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5060.12s)]
*  it nice and warm so it's an environment, put trees up everywhere and then just let shit [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5064.24s)]
*  loose and watch. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5067.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5068.64s)]
*  Then I was like, that's so fucked up. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5069.64s)]
*  And then I started thinking, what's wrong with you? [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5070.64s)]
*  If I started thinking about me going, I didn't like me. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5073.24s)]
*  Imagine taking one of your friends over your house and you have a murder sanctuary in the [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5078.12s)]
*  centerpiece of your home. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5084.32s)]
*  Oh. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5085.32s)]
*  The atrium of your home is just like you watch animals just get slaughtered. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5086.5199999999995s)]
*  They have no chance of escape, unlike the wild. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5089.719999999999s)]
*  In the wild, the rabbit can get away. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5091.92s)]
*  Dude, we used to do that. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5093.719999999999s)]
*  In our fraternity, my buddy Mason had a big python and they'd buy rats and they'd put [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5094.719999999999s)]
*  money on it and they'd put them in the corners and put the python in the center and they [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5100.639999999999s)]
*  have the benches from our cafeteria lined up and be in a square and we'd bet on which [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5103.4s)]
*  one he'd eat first. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5108.84s)]
*  And it was crazy. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5110.88s)]
*  Rats would go right up to the snake's face and touch the snake's face. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5111.88s)]
*  Snake's face wouldn't even fucking touch it. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5114.72s)]

*  Your mastiff is fucking huge. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5236.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5239.44s)]
*  They were just toying with it, I think. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5240.44s)]
*  They were just fucking throwing them around. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5241.44s)]

*  Dude, I have. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5264.32s)]
*  That's how they look at them. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5265.32s)]
*  I don't think they're like rats. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5266.32s)]
*  Let me just be real clear. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5267.32s)]
*  I think they're cool. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5268.32s)]
*  But I wanted to kill one. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5269.32s)]
*  I wanted to kill them when they killed all my chickens. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5270.32s)]
*  Dude, I have. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5271.8s)]

*  Yeah, don't shoot your neighbors, dude. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5281.68s)]
*  California laws allows for the killing of fur-bearing mammal that is injuring property [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5284.400000000001s)]

*  Any manner. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5291.88s)]
*  However, animal cruelty laws prohibit maliciously and intentionally maiming, mutilating, torturing, [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5292.88s)]
*  wounding, or killing an animal. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5298.5199999999995s)]
*  There I go. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5300.08s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5301.08s)]
*  Prohibit intentionally killing an animal. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5302.08s)]
*  So how can you have a law that allows for killing a fur-bearing mammal that is injuring [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5304.04s)]
*  property at any time and any manner, but also have a law that prohibits intentionally killing [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5308.639999999999s)]
*  an animal? [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5315.92s)]
*  It's got to be doing injuring property. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5316.92s)]
*  It says maliciously so you'd be angry. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5318.4s)]
*  Wait, hold on. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5320.88s)]
*  Am I saying the word possum wrong? [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5321.88s)]
*  Possums. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5323.44s)]
*  No, I say it. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5324.44s)]
*  Opossum, I think, is the right way to say it. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5325.44s)]
*  It's like a ... Did you know it's wheelbarrow? [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5327.5199999999995s)]
*  It's not barrel? [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5331.04s)]
*  Uh-uh. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5332.04s)]
*  It's wheelbarrow. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5333.04s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5334.04s)]
*  Makes it illegal to intentionally and maliciously kill an animal. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5335.04s)]
*  But intentionally and maliciously are different things. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5338.839999999999s)]
*  If you're killing an animal to protect your dog ... Oh, here it is. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5342.2s)]
*  The key difference lies in the intent and manner of killing. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5347.08s)]
*  Killing an opossum that is causing damage to property is one thing, but torturing or [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5350.82s)]
*  inflicting unnecessary suffering is a different matter. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5354.16s)]
*  Okay, that makes sense. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5356.76s)]
*  I think my dogs broke the law. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5357.76s)]
*  Here is a guy who was convicted and sentenced for torturing an opossum to death, including [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5359.68s)]
*  beating, burning, and hanging it from a noose. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5364.64s)]
*  Okay. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5366.72s)]
*  That's a lot. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5367.72s)]
*  That's a lot. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5368.72s)]
*  In another case, father and son were arrested for allegedly killing an opossum, but the [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5369.72s)]
*  arrests were later deemed unlawful, and the city settled a lawsuit with the family for [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5374.28s)]
*  $400,000. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5378.4s)]
*  Okay. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5381.4s)]
*  Consider contacting a professional pest control operator or wildlife removal service. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5383.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm not too worried about possums. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5388.679999999999s)]
*  In our old house, we had rats. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5392.8s)]

*  Don't you have an adjustable site? [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5408.08s)]
*  No, I have four sites. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5409.08s)]

*  Yeah, you should go there. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5435.400000000001s)]
*  I get weird with that shit. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5436.400000000001s)]
*  I have weird issues about joining in or doing something new, like getting into a spin class [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5437.400000000001s)]
*  that I've never met anyone. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5441.4400000000005s)]
*  I just kind of like doing it in my backyard. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5442.4400000000005s)]
*  Doing it in the backyard is fun, but just for your own ability to get better at it, [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5444.8s)]
*  you really should stretch out your distance. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5449.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5451.8s)]
*  What happens is there's little tiny errors in your form that don't show up at 20 yards [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5452.92s)]
*  that'll show up at 60 yards. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5457.76s)]
*  And you got to find out what those are. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5460.2s)]
*  I always shoot at 85 yards. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5462.76s)]
*  You shoot at 85 yards? [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5465.92s)]
*  85 yards. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5466.92s)]
*  At your house? [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5467.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5468.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5469.92s)]
*  I set 85 yards as a distance I would never shoot an animal at. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5470.92s)]
*  And if I could be super accurate at 85 yards, when an animal's at 50 yards, it feels to [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5475.16s)]
*  me like a chip shot. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5479.4400000000005s)]
*  Like I can just nail it. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5480.72s)]
*  Because I'm always shooting long distances. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5482.92s)]
*  So at a long distance, any little deviation or torque of your hand, it can make a big [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5484.839999999999s)]
*  difference in how the arrow goes off. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5492.599999999999s)]
*  And at 70 yards, it might be four or five, six inches to the left, to the right, up, [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5495.0s)]
*  down. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5500.0s)]
*  It's spread out. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5501.0s)]
*  And you want to tighten it up like this. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5502.0s)]
*  You want to get that group like a softball. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5503.28s)]
*  That's what I want. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5505.4s)]
*  I want a softball at 85 yards. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5506.4s)]
*  That's when I know I can go hunting. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5508.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5509.48s)]
*  And if I get a softball at 85 yards, I'm dialed. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5510.599999999999s)]
*  I'm dialed in. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5513.12s)]
*  I've been shooting from a higher platform too. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5514.12s)]
*  Is that bad? [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5518.16s)]
*  That's very good. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5519.16s)]
*  That's very good. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5520.16s)]
*  Especially if you ever have to go hunting in a tree stand. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5521.16s)]
*  Tree stand hunting is very difficult. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5523.5599999999995s)]
*  So I've only done it once. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5526.339999999999s)]
*  My good friend John Dudley took me to his farm in Iowa. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5528.08s)]
*  John actually taught me a lot about archery too. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5532.48s)]
*  Most of what I know about form and technique I learned from John. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5535.599999999999s)]
*  Anyway, John has this amazing setup in Iowa. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5540.12s)]
*  You go up in these tree stands and you have to buckle yourself in with a safety wire or [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5542.599999999999s)]
*  a safety rope. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5547.4s)]
*  You're sitting there all day. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5549.5199999999995s)]
*  You sit all day. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5552.08s)]
*  It's freezing. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5554.679999999999s)]
*  It's November. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5556.5599999999995s)]
*  It's in Iowa. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5557.5599999999995s)]
*  It's fucking three degrees. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5558.5599999999995s)]
*  You're sitting there freezing your fucking dick off. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5559.5599999999995s)]
*  Sometimes you have these giant suits that you put over your whole body and zip up like [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5562.96s)]
*  you're a giant burrito of fur, almost like a sleeping bag. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5566.88s)]
*  And you're sober and you're not doing anything but just waiting. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5570.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you can't be drunk. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5572.24s)]
*  You can't be listening to a podcast. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5573.24s)]
*  You really shouldn't. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5575.76s)]
*  You want to hear branches snapping. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5577.76s)]
*  You want to hear the little cracks, the little sounds, little ch-ch-ch-ch. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5579.52s)]
*  That's what you're listening for. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5584.12s)]
*  Guys even wear these things called Walker game ears. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5585.4400000000005s)]
*  And Walker game ears, it's almost like a hearing aid and you put them in and you crank it up [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5588.84s)]
*  and you can hear things like way amplified, way amplified. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5593.64s)]
*  There's certain headphones you wear if you go to a gun range that they tune out any sound [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5599.080000000001s)]
*  that's over a certain pitch, like a certain volume, but amplify other sounds. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5609.0s)]
*  So you can hear people talking from way away. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5614.88s)]
*  Really? [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5617.56s)]
*  Yeah, way stronger ability to hear. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5618.56s)]
*  But then the gun, it cuts out the sound when it gets to a dangerous, so every gun is like [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5620.84s)]
*  tak tak tak, tak tak tak. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5625.32s)]
*  But the sound of other people is still present. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5627.8s)]
*  So you can talk at a gun range. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5630.28s)]
*  You don't have to have like full ear, like the foam one stuffed in there where you have [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5631.84s)]
*  to pull, like a Tarrantactical, they always use those. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5636.08s)]
*  You have to pull them out to talk to people. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5638.2s)]
*  So these guys wear things like that so they can hear everything in the forest. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5641.24s)]
*  They can hear every little sound because when a deer is coming in, they come in slowly. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5646.12s)]
*  They're all wary and shit. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5651.400000000001s)]
*  They're stepping on the grass. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5652.92s)]
*  They're moving around. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5654.400000000001s)]
*  And you might just hear something, just a rustle. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5655.400000000001s)]
*  And you're like, where's it? [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5657.8s)]
*  And you see him. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5659.400000000001s)]
*  Oh shit, there he is, there he is. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5660.400000000001s)]
*  And then you got to get your bow. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5661.400000000001s)]
*  So you're waiting all day for one moment and you're shooting down because the animals, [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5662.4400000000005s)]
*  they're down below you or you're at a sharp angle. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5667.92s)]
*  So you have to have a range compensating, an angle compensating range fighter because [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5671.6s)]
*  the shot might be 40 yards, but it actually might be 20 yards because you're shooting [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5676.92s)]
*  straight down. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5680.92s)]
*  So you're shooting straight down. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5682.52s)]
*  The way your arrow is going to drop, it's not going to be as affected by gravity. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5684.36s)]
*  So if you're shooting 40 yards on a flat plane, the arrow is going to arc and it's going to [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5689.16s)]
*  drop. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5693.6s)]
*  So over the course of the 40 yards, if your arrow is going 290 feet per second, which [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5694.64s)]
*  is a good speed, it's going to slowly drop until it gets to 40 yards. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5700.12s)]
*  That's why your range, like you set up the pin, you move it to where the arrow is going [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5705.6s)]
*  to be when it finally gets there at 40 yards. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5709.44s)]
*  You'll know where the dip is. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5711.76s)]
*  Can you move your own pin? [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5712.76s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5713.76s)]
*  Oh, I need a camera. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5714.76s)]
*  I have a wheel that it's set up that like, I have what's called a Spot Hog, a Fast Eddie, [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5716.2s)]
*  and it's got two pins on it. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5722.36s)]
*  And one pin will be at 20 yards, the other pin will be at 35 yards. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5724.36s)]
*  And then I move it down and then the one pin is at 50 yards and the other pin is at like [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5729.2s)]
*  75 yards. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5734.56s)]
*  Oh, that's not mine. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5735.56s)]
*  Or 65. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5736.56s)]
*  Mine's just got four different sights. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5737.56s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5738.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5739.56s)]
*  So mine is an adjustable one that's on a wheel and that's what you need because like with [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5740.56s)]
*  a rain, like say if a deer is coming in and you're in a tree stand, you look and you're [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5743.56s)]
*  like that's pretty far away, but it's pretty far like this straight down. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5747.56s)]
*  So pretty far straight down, your arrow is not going to drop as much as if you were shooting [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5752.280000000001s)]
*  straight. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5756.400000000001s)]
*  If you're shooting straight, it's going to go boom. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5757.400000000001s)]
*  And then so you have to have a rangefinder that figures that out for you. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5759.080000000001s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5762.320000000001s)]
*  Even though that's 40 yards away, the angle compensation is actually 26 yards. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5763.4s)]
*  So you have to dial your shit to 26 yards and then you'll be perfect. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5768.12s)]
*  Have you ever gone fishing with a bow? [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5772.5199999999995s)]
*  No, I have not, but it looks amazing. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5775.28s)]
*  It is so fucking difficult. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5777.08s)]
*  It looks fun too, though. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5778.96s)]
*  It's fun, but it's difficult because of the water reflection, you've got to shoot like [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5781.12s)]
*  six inches below it, right? [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5785.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5787.0s)]
*  Well, I don't know because I never got one. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5788.0s)]
*  So yeah, I was and I was a little drunk. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5789.32s)]
*  I was like, this will be easy. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5791.72s)]
*  I think you have to shoot six. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5793.4400000000005s)]
*  It's refract reflac refraction, right? [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5795.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5797.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think you have to shoot below what you see. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5798.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5800.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5801.76s)]
*  That's a mindfuck. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5802.76s)]
*  I couldn't. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5803.76s)]
*  I mean, we sat out there with salmon all over. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5804.76s)]
*  You can see them. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5807.320000000001s)]
*  It was. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5808.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5809.320000000001s)]
*  And I fucking must have taken 100 shots. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5810.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5811.320000000001s)]
*  That must have been so fun. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5812.320000000001s)]
*  It was fun, but you know, was that that is that like a recurve bow or is that a bow with [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5814.400000000001s)]
*  a release? [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5818.64s)]
*  I don't remember. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5819.64s)]
*  I think it was I think it was I think it was a compound bow. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5820.96s)]
*  OK. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5823.84s)]
*  I think so. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5824.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's better. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5825.84s)]
*  The compound bow. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5826.84s)]
*  You could be more accurate. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5827.84s)]
*  So with the compound bow, like I don't know how to aim with a recurve bow at all. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5828.84s)]
*  I've only shot one like three or four times ever. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5833.400000000001s)]
*  And I went on this trip to Lanai with my family. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5835.84s)]
*  And one of the things that they had was like this little archery lesson. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5838.64s)]
*  You could take archery classes and shoot at the little targets and they had recurve bows. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5841.68s)]
*  I'd never shot a bow without a sight before. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5846.52s)]
*  I was like trying to like line it up. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5849.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5850.72s)]
*  Line up where the how do you know where the arrow is going to go? [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5851.72s)]
*  That's the only bows I've ever shot. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5853.2s)]
*  It's like a recurve. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5855.16s)]
*  Yeah, recurve. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5856.16s)]
*  I shot a recurve bow. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5857.16s)]
*  We did like archery lessons in Italy. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5858.16s)]
*  And so we were different. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5861.48s)]
*  You know how like those hills are like almost like steps. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5862.88s)]
*  And so they'd have but it was weird because the recurve bow is such that you had to hold [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5866.2s)]
*  it kind of like an angle. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5869.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5871.2s)]
*  So that the arrow stays on the shelf. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5872.2s)]
*  During the pandemic, I got the girls both recurve bows and we would shoot in the backyard [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5873.48s)]
*  all the time. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5877.639999999999s)]
*  It's fun. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5879.08s)]
*  It's definitely fun. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5880.08s)]
*  But it's kind of like throwing a rock or like throwing a baseball. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5881.08s)]
*  Like you've got to like have a feel for where that baseball is going to go at 30 yards, [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5884.96s)]
*  at 40 yards, at 50 yards. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5890.160000000001s)]
*  You know, if you had to throw a baseball and hit a tree, you would know, OK, I got to throw [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5891.360000000001s)]
*  it a little harder. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5895.56s)]
*  You get a feel. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5896.56s)]
*  So that's different than regular archery. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5898.46s)]
*  Like or excuse me, compound archery, because compound archery, you're basically relying [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5901.12s)]
*  on the sight and the technique. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5905.52s)]
*  Like you dial it in, you get that pin, it's at 42 yards, and then you're just going through [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5907.8s)]
*  your shot process. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5912.72s)]
*  You're just staying steady and making sure you go through your shot process perfect so [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5913.72s)]
*  that when the shot breaks, the arrow goes exactly where you want to. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5918.08s)]
*  But with a recurve, like you have to practice all the time because you have to have that [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5921.400000000001s)]
*  feel. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5926.0s)]
*  You have to have a feel and know where that arrow is going to go. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5927.0s)]
*  You're looking down the shaft of your arrow, but your accuracy is greatly diminished compared [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5931.64s)]
*  to like a compound bow. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5938.72s)]
*  I haven't shot my, I only shoot my compound bow now, but I haven't shot my recurve bow [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5939.72s)]
*  with the little wristlet thing Kim gave me. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5944.4800000000005s)]
*  I like to do that because I use always just my fingers. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5947.240000000001s)]
*  Well that's an interesting thing. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5951.0s)]
*  So use a release on a recurve. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5952.1s)]
*  I'm sure people do that. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5954.0s)]
*  You'd have to put a D loop on it though. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5955.0s)]
*  Or no, I guess not. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5956.6s)]
*  You could hold it from the top or the bottom. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5957.6s)]
*  That would be better. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5959.360000000001s)]
*  That would definitely be better. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5961.04s)]
*  So you definitely get a more consistent release. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5962.04s)]
*  But people want to be primitive. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5963.96s)]
*  Like the real psychos, what happens is guys, the highest level of bow hunting is guys go [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5965.96s)]
*  after like elk and deer with a recurve bow. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5971.639999999999s)]
*  My friend Aaron Schneider did that for a couple of years. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5974.839999999999s)]
*  He only shot, cause he's like an elite hunter, like an elite bow hunter. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5977.44s)]
*  But what's the ultimate poundage of a recurve bow? [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5981.44s)]
*  What's the highest it can go? [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5983.799999999999s)]
*  You're not getting nearly the amount of kinetic energy. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5985.2s)]
*  So the kinetic energy you would get from a compound bow, like Aaron's a big guy. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5988.64s)]
*  He's pretty jacked. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5992.9s)]
*  And so like his bow is like an 82, 85 pound bow probably. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5994.06s)]
*  And he's a big guy. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5998.82s)]
*  So he's probably got a 30 inch draw somewhere around there. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=5999.94s)]
*  So he's getting insane amounts of kinetic energy in these arrows. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6004.06s)]
*  Just blowing through everything. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6009.1s)]
*  That's the craziest part of getting fitted for a bow. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6010.5s)]
*  Cause I was always like, I was always come here, I was like, Joe, let me shoot your bow. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6013.46s)]
*  And you're like, it's not that easy because it's set up for a person. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6016.06s)]
*  Yeah. It's set up for your wingspan. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6019.06s)]
*  Like you're taller than me. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6020.740000000001s)]
*  So you're what is your, your, do you know where your draw length is? [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6022.06s)]
*  No, Cam did all of it and I was just listening. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6024.820000000001s)]
*  Your draw length's probably 29 and a half, maybe 30 inches. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6027.660000000001s)]
*  Mine's 28. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6031.18s)]
*  So 20, I used to have 28 and a half and then I dropped down to 28 and I adjusted a few things. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6032.580000000001s)]
*  And I feel like the more tension at the end, like the further back you are, like I know guys who want extra energy. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6038.34s)]
*  And so they're what's called overdrawn. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6045.74s)]
*  So they maybe should have a 27 inch draw, but they have a 29 inch draw and they have their release way back here. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6047.98s)]
*  So they're shooting things totally different. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6055.54s)]
*  You would never tell anybody to do that. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6057.26s)]
*  But some guys get really good doing that and then they just stick with it. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6059.26s)]
*  Like it's all about repeatability. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6063.0599999999995s)]
*  But Cam taught me, like Cam is a, he's smaller than his draws a little bit smaller than mine. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6064.82s)]
*  His is 27 and he had a longer draw. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6070.139999999999s)]
*  He started out with a longer draw as well, but then brought it. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6072.74s)]
*  For him, the ultimate thing is accuracy. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6076.1s)]
*  And he's like, when your bow is more tense, more taut, and there's more tension on it, [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6078.66s)]
*  if it's a shorter draw length, you're more accurate. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6084.900000000001s)]
*  You want to get it perfect. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6088.02s)]
*  You want to exactly what your frame is. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6089.34s)]
*  And for me, it seems like 28 inches is the right number. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6091.34s)]
*  I had one of my most manly moments of my entire life in that bow, in that bow store. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6095.780000000001s)]
*  It's a very manly place. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6100.700000000001s)]
*  Dude, Cam was like, they had me set for like a 40 pound bow. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6101.78s)]
*  And I go, okay. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6107.139999999999s)]
*  And he was like, I go, what do you guys shoot? [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6108.26s)]
*  Like you and Rogan, he was like 80 pounds, I think. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6110.66s)]
*  It was what he said. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6112.7s)]
*  90. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6113.94s)]
*  Okay, so it's 90. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6114.66s)]
*  So Cam goes, I go, is that one tough to pull back? [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6115.74s)]
*  And he was like, yeah. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6119.38s)]
*  And I was like, can I try? [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6120.94s)]
*  And he was like, okay. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6122.219999999999s)]
*  So he pulls it and brings it over. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6124.34s)]
*  You know, all the bow guys are there. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6126.26s)]
*  So I hang it and I pull it back. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6127.66s)]

*  She's going to lose it. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6641.66s)]
*  And he's going to be like, I didn't see that coming. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6642.78s)]

*  It's not my thing. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6668.14s)]
*  But for some people, he loves living in Vegas. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6668.900000000001s)]

*  Why wouldn't he love it? [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6676.7s)]
*  The sport's there all the time. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6678.14s)]
*  We've got the UFC PI there. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6679.5s)]
*  So there's fights there almost every month. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6681.06s)]
*  There's a fight at the apex at least. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6684.62s)]
*  Can I tell you the craziest experience [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6688.98s)]
*  of that whole thing other than meeting Mel Gibson, which [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6691.14s)]
*  was a dream? [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6693.62s)]
*  He was the sweetest guy. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6695.46s)]
*  He's a nice guy. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6696.54s)]
*  He was a nice guy. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6697.14s)]
*  I told you I met him on the plane and flying here. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6697.82s)]
*  And then he walked by me. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6700.9s)]
*  Like when he left at the plane, he's like, [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6702.82s)]
*  maybe I'll see you this weekend. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6704.46s)]
*  I was like, hopefully. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6705.42s)]
*  And then when he walked into UFC, he came over, [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6706.5s)]
*  grabbed my leg. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6708.26s)]
*  He's like, what's up, big guy? [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6708.74s)]
*  And I was like, ah. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6710.0599999999995s)]
*  The guys next to me are like, you know Mel Gibson? [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6711.26s)]
*  I was like, yeah. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6714.22s)]
*  But the coolest part was the fucking guy, Ari Emanuel. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6715.14s)]
*  Watching the character from Entourage [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6722.3s)]
*  be himself, because I sat right behind him. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6724.820000000001s)]
*  And he was just, he's the guy. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6727.46s)]
*  He's much more reasonable than the character. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6729.900000000001s)]
*  But he's still a character. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6732.14s)]
*  Oh, he's definitely a character. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6733.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6734.9400000000005s)]
*  Nice guy. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6735.42s)]
*  He's a nice guy. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6735.92s)]
*  Him and Peter Berg were right in front of me in the end. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6736.58s)]
*  I love that dude. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6739.900000000001s)]
*  Peter Berg's the shit. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6740.7s)]

*  God. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6747.42s)]
*  Peter Berg's a great dude. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6748.099999999999s)]
*  And he was a great actor. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6749.98s)]
*  Do you remember Aspen Extreme? [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6751.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6752.42s)]
*  He was great in the show, too. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6753.46s)]
*  He was great in American Prime Evil. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6756.099999999999s)]
*  He's great. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6757.66s)]
*  He's been in a bunch of movies. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6758.139999999999s)]
*  But I think he really shines as a filmmaker. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6759.38s)]
*  Wait, what's the movie, what's the TV show Gary Oldman's [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6762.38s)]
*  in right now? [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6765.34s)]
*  Not Black Doves. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6766.42s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6768.42s)]
*  It's an Apple. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6769.94s)]
*  Joe, this is the best damn show out there. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6770.7s)]
*  Apple's making some banging shows, man. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6772.62s)]
*  Slow Horses. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6774.42s)]
*  Have you seen it? [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6775.3s)]
*  No. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6775.94s)]
*  Joe, Slow Horses is Gary Oldman's best work yet, [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6776.5s)]
*  in my opinion. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6781.74s)]
*  He is so fucking good. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6783.22s)]
*  And it is such a great show. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6785.14s)]
*  Damn, Slow Horses on Netflix. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6787.3s)]
*  It's what's great about these shows. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6789.38s)]
*  Oh, no, on Apple. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6791.22s)]
*  The English or Slow Horses or Black Doves is there six [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6792.3s)]
*  episodes, but it's a six episode arc. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6797.0599999999995s)]
*  So it's not just episodic like we [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6799.82s)]
*  remember like old dramas being where the whole thing happened [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6801.66s)]
*  in the hour. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6806.099999999999s)]
*  And then you never have to watch that again. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6806.62s)]
*  Brand new one. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6808.38s)]

*  There are these episode arcs where it starts off [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6810.62s)]
*  telling a story. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6812.9s)]
*  And you pay out by the last episode, [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6814.099999999999s)]
*  much like Peaky Blinders. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6816.5s)]
*  Peaky Blinders, they were great standalone episodes. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6818.18s)]
*  But that episode, it was so addictive. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6821.099999999999s)]
*  That's what the streamers have changed [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6823.9s)]
*  the way we're taking in content. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6826.3s)]
*  Because if you start Slow Horses tonight, [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6827.94s)]
*  you'll watch all six. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6831.18s)]
*  And then you'll be like, honey, we're [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6832.34s)]
*  watching all of these tomorrow. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6833.22s)]

*  Love Dracula. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6847.46s)]

*  And he's like, fuck. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6859.7s)]
*  And just waking up covered in blood. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6862.139999999999s)]
*  Like, what happened? [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6863.78s)]
*  The idea of it is just so crazy. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6864.82s)]
*  I always just always loved werewolf movies. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6867.0599999999995s)]
*  What happened to Benicio del Toro's werewolf movie? [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6869.0599999999995s)]
*  That was a good one. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6870.98s)]
*  I never saw it. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6871.78s)]
*  It was good. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6872.26s)]
*  It just petered out. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6872.82s)]
*  There was some real great moments in it. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6873.98s)]
*  We played it a bunch of times. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6876.139999999999s)]
*  But the one when they're in the theater, the medical theater, [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6877.62s)]
*  and he's trying to convince this guy that the guy's insane. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6881.26s)]
*  He's like, I'm here to show you that he will not [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6883.98s)]
*  turn into a wolf. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6886.34s)]
*  He thinks he will. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6887.46s)]
*  And so they have him strapped up. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6889.22s)]
*  It's like, I'm going to kill you all. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6890.5s)]
*  His body starts fucking. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6893.34s)]
*  It's an amazing transformation scene. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6894.34s)]
*  But Rick Baker did that film. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6896.820000000001s)]
*  The same guy that did American Werewolf in London. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6898.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's the werewolf that we have in the lobby. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6902.18s)]
*  That's the greatest werewolf movie of all time. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6905.46s)]
*  No question. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6908.34s)]
*  Because it's John Landis. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6909.1s)]
*  It's actually funny. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6910.38s)]
*  There's funny moments in it. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6911.42s)]
*  It's really fucking good. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6913.14s)]
*  It's a good movie. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6914.62s)]
*  They did a great job of only showing [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6915.58s)]
*  the wolf like a little bit. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6917.26s)]
*  You're really scared when you actually see it. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6918.82s)]
*  They don't get you numb to the thing being there. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6921.0199999999995s)]
*  So this is the theater scene. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6924.42s)]
*  He starts changing. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6926.78s)]
*  So this is like they did a combination of CGI and makeup. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6931.58s)]
*  So the thing about CGI is like right there, that's CGI. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6936.9s)]
*  CGI, you kind of know it's CGI. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6940.58s)]
*  There's the uncanny valley effect, right? [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6943.5s)]
*  When he fully transforms in the scenes [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6946.9400000000005s)]
*  where he's attacking people, he's an actor. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6950.3s)]
*  He's Benicio del Toro, but with all these prosthetics on. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6953.54s)]
*  And it looks much more realistic, [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6957.5s)]
*  like the way it moves, the way it behaves. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6959.26s)]
*  Like when he goes after these people, it seems, [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6963.9400000000005s)]
*  well go back up so you can see it rip the guy's heart out. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6966.34s)]
*  Oh, he threw the dude through the window. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6969.3s)]
*  His backup a little bit before that [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6973.820000000001s)]
*  is when he tears the guy apart. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6975.58s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6983.740000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=6999.14s)]
*  See, so when it's a dude in a costume [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7004.9800000000005s)]
*  with all the fur on it, the way it moves is just, [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7007.9800000000005s)]
*  they can't quite fix that. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7011.58s)]
*  In CGI? [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7013.9400000000005s)]
*  It's not quite there. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7014.780000000001s)]
*  It still gives you that thing [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7016.740000000001s)]
*  where there's a suspension of disbelief. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7018.62s)]
*  But when they use makeup, [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7021.38s)]
*  it's still a little bit of a surprise. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7025.06s)]
*  When they use makeup, [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7028.3s)]
*  like they did in American Werewolf in London, [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7029.78s)]
*  and the transformation scene in American Werewolf in London, [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7031.9800000000005s)]
*  do you remember that one? [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7034.86s)]
*  The guy's in the bedroom or in the living room [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7035.7s)]
*  and he just starts fucking, [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7038.38s)]
*  ah, and his back pops up and he stretches out [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7039.42s)]
*  and starts getting covered in hair. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7042.82s)]
*  Aren't they playing CCR in that? [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7044.26s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's Bad Moon. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7046.26s)]
*  Werewolf in London. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7048.26s)]
*  No, I think it's Bad Moon on the Rise. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7049.5s)]
*  There's a bad moon on the rise. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7051.46s)]
*  God damn. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7055.1s)]
*  I think I could use a new werewolf. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7056.74s)]
*  You know what they were doing? [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7057.98s)]
*  The guy who did Nosferatu [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7059.22s)]
*  is gonna do a werewolf movie now. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7060.7s)]
*  No shit. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7062.3s)]
*  They were gonna do a series of all the horror movies [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7063.139999999999s)]
*  and it started with The Mummy with Tom Cruise. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7067.34s)]
*  They had one set up for Johnny Depp. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7069.179999999999s)]
*  But The Mummy with Tom Cruise is not the mummy, [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7070.98s)]
*  the scary mummy from when we were kids. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7073.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but they were all reimagined. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7075.62s)]
*  I took a meeting with whatever that studio was [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7076.94s)]
*  and they always wanted a comedic actor in it. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7080.5s)]
*  For the one that in The Mummy it was Jake. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7083.9s)]
*  Jake, guy's such a great actor [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7087.259999999999s)]
*  and I'm fucking flaking on his name. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7088.9s)]
*  He was in New Girl. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7091.259999999999s)]
*  Jake. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7092.099999999999s)]
*  Jake Johnson. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7093.299999999999s)]
*  Jake Johnson's funny as shit. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7094.86s)]
*  He is a great actor [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7097.259999999999s)]
*  and he was the comedic relief in The Mummy. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7098.38s)]
*  And they were gonna do that with each of them. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7102.5s)]
*  And so they had one set up for Johnny Depp. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7104.38s)]
*  They had them set up for big stars. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7109.219999999999s)]
*  Everyone was getting their own. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7110.62s)]
*  Wasn't it Brandon Fraser originally? [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7111.66s)]
*  He was in The Original Mummy. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7114.58s)]
*  Original, original. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7116.42s)]
*  Yeah, and then it was The Rock. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7117.78s)]
*  Oh, that's right, that's right. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7119.7s)]
*  And then it was Tom Cruise. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7120.9s)]
*  I love Brandon Fraser's revival. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7123.5s)]
*  Isn't it amazing? [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7126.179999999999s)]
*  Dude. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7127.0199999999995s)]
*  Isn't it great when a guy comes back [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7127.86s)]
*  and not just comes back, [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7129.42s)]
*  but comes back and kills it in a movie [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7130.7s)]
*  and then has this heartfelt speech [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7132.94s)]
*  where he's tearing up and crying. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7135.219999999999s)]
*  Everybody loves him again. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7137.86s)]
*  That must have felt awful for that guy. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7139.5s)]
*  He was this giant movie star. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7141.34s)]
*  He was in all these giant films [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7143.9800000000005s)]
*  and then for whatever reason, [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7144.82s)]
*  he just kind of faded away. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7145.78s)]
*  He got me too. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7147.3s)]
*  Is that what happened? [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7148.62s)]
*  But by a dude. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7149.46s)]
*  The dude tried to fucking touch him [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7150.9400000000005s)]
*  and he stood up to the guy and was like, [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7153.18s)]
*  hey man, you go fuck yourself. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7154.02s)]
*  The guy's like, I'll ruin your career. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7155.14s)]
*  Obviously my memory is whatever the fuck it is. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7157.06s)]
*  But he came out and he said, [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7159.3s)]
*  I was blackballed because I fucking called a dude out. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7160.78s)]
*  Let's find out if that's true. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7164.7s)]
*  Yeah, find out if that's true. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7165.7s)]
*  We might have to edit that out. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7166.54s)]
*  Allegedly. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7169.02s)]
*  Allegedly. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7170.14s)]
*  Allegedly is a great word. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7170.9800000000005s)]
*  But it's crazy those, [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7173.7s)]
*  I saw something with Mickey Rourke. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7175.9s)]
*  I mean, he said it. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7178.74s)]
*  That's what he said? [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7179.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7180.42s)]
*  Okay. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7181.26s)]
*  Mickey Rourke said he hadn't worked for 13 years. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7182.08s)]
*  And Mickey Rourke was the man. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7184.58s)]
*  Oh, did he? [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7186.34s)]
*  Pope of Greenwich Village. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7187.179999999999s)]
*  Oh, Angel Heart? [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7188.0s)]

*  an actual cowboy. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7590.04s)]

*  is like completely legitimate. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7614.8s)]
*  It's why Yellowstone is so good. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7617.679999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7619.08s)]
*  You can't, you can kind of, I mean, you can fake it. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7619.92s)]
*  People have faked it before, [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7622.36s)]
*  but when someone does it that really loves it, [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7623.44s)]
*  that's when it gets people excited [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7625.4s)]
*  and they move to Montana. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7626.84s)]
*  They decide they want, I want to live that life. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7628.08s)]

*  I want to be on Pandora. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7633.16s)]
*  It's like people, you know, [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7634.96s)]
*  you get sucked in by someone who's done an amazing job [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7636.16s)]
*  of telling a film or a story and a show. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7639.68s)]
*  And that's what entertainment is really all about. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7642.2s)]
*  For me, I'm not looking for any fucking lessons [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7644.92s)]
*  about equity and inclusion, diversity. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7648.36s)]
*  I'm already, I already think that way. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7651.96s)]
*  I already think that all human beings are the same. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7654.56s)]
*  We're all just one thing experiencing each other [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7657.04s)]
*  subjectively as Bill Hicks said. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7659.44s)]
*  I believe that. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7661.56s)]
*  So I don't need that lesson. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7662.6s)]
*  That lesson just makes me feel like you're preaching to me [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7664.08s)]
*  and that shit's annoying. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7666.4s)]
*  I don't like it. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7667.44s)]
*  It's boring. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7668.5199999999995s)]
*  I get, I already know these things. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7669.36s)]
*  Stop. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7670.76s)]
*  We're doing it for other people. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7671.88s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7673.04s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7674.32s)]
*  It just makes people more self-righteous [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7675.16s)]
*  and they want to talk about it all the time. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7676.72s)]
*  I have a weird question. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7678.5599999999995s)]
*  Do you think, cause like, I feel like, [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7680.08s)]
*  cause I'm on Instagram a lot, [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7683.12s)]
*  like I might be switching to a flip phone. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7684.12s)]
*  But I'm not watching anything. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7687.36s)]
*  Right after you quit drinking, right? [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7688.96s)]
*  No, my wife already bought the flip phone. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7690.6s)]
*  She was like, dude, my daughter's put [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7692.64s)]
*  parental controls on my Instagram. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7695.360000000001s)]
*  Ah, it's hilarious. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7696.88s)]
*  Yeah, I got it. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7698.200000000001s)]
*  Don't worry, I can get through them. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7699.52s)]
*  But would you think that like, [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7700.84s)]
*  I notice it seems like a lot of people now [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7704.08s)]
*  are almost living for Instagram. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7706.4400000000005s)]
*  Like, hey, this is me and my three friends [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7709.4800000000005s)]
*  and we're sailing around the world. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7711.92s)]
*  And then do you think people were doing that [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7713.08s)]
*  before Instagram? [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7714.84s)]
*  No. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7715.68s)]
*  No, I think definitely people are doing things [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7716.52s)]
*  so that they can show that they're doing things. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7718.88s)]
*  But if you're actually doing things, [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7721.56s)]
*  like it's a balancing thing. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7724.080000000001s)]
*  Like if you're experiencing more stuff [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7725.72s)]
*  because you're documenting it for your YouTube channel, [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7727.72s)]
*  you're still experiencing more stuff. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7729.76s)]
*  I mean, you are kind of, you're putting it all out there, [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7731.56s)]
*  but if you're still experiencing more stuff, [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7733.4800000000005s)]
*  like that's probably net positive. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7736.360000000001s)]
*  The problem is when you find yourself [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7739.280000000001s)]
*  hanging out with your friends, [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7741.64s)]
*  but all you're doing is staring at your phone, [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7742.88s)]
*  you know, and it's a real trap that we all get sucked into, [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7745.160000000001s)]
*  especially if you've got a good algorithm. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7749.6s)]
*  You know, it's filled with stuff that pisses you off [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7751.76s)]
*  or freaks you out, which is mine. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7753.88s)]
*  Oh, I don't watch any, my shit's all people doing epic shit. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7755.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, that's good. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7759.8s)]
*  Yeah, like I followed these two dudes, Climb Everest. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7760.96s)]
*  I followed them on Instagram, Climb fucking Everest. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7763.68s)]
*  And I was like, I want to climb Mount Kilimanjaro. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7766.52s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7770.08s)]
*  Kilimanjaro's achievable. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7770.92s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7772.04s)]
*  But I go, I want to do epic shit. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7772.88s)]
*  Like I got to a place when I started taking time off in July [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7773.72s)]
*  and I was like, yo, I need, I want a month. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7777.240000000001s)]
*  I want to sail to Hawaii. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7780.28s)]
*  I want to see what it's like to be afraid, you know, [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7781.12s)]
*  in the middle of the ocean. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7784.639999999999s)]
*  Pull up how many people die in Mount Kilimanjaro. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7785.48s)]
*  Oh, nobody. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7789.919999999999s)]
*  Mount Kilimanjaro is easy. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7790.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, people die. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7791.599999999999s)]
*  It's a light lift, it's a light lift. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7792.44s)]
*  People have died. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7793.28s)]
*  Mount Kilimanjaro is easy. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7794.099999999999s)]
*  I guarantee you. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7794.94s)]
*  No, it's like a long hot hike. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7795.78s)]
*  I bet people have died. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7797.2s)]
*  Okay, I bet it's under 10. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7798.839999999999s)]
*  How many? [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7800.16s)]
*  10 a year. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7801.0s)]
*  Three to 10 a year. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7801.82s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7802.66s)]
*  But watch how many people die going to Everest. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7804.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's not good. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7806.28s)]
*  Well, if you play Rush and Roulette with five bullets, [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7807.88s)]
*  you get shot more. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7809.56s)]
*  I only play with one. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7810.400000000001s)]
*  How? [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7811.6s)]
*  Ask him. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7812.4400000000005s)]
*  No, hold on. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7813.280000000001s)]
*  Don't. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7814.12s)]
*  That's the stupid fucking thing to say. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7814.9400000000005s)]
*  You know how many people definitely don't die [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7817.84s)]
*  on Mount Kilimanjaro that don't go to Mount Kilimanjaro? [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7819.88s)]
*  100% of them. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7822.72s)]
*  100% of all of them. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7823.56s)]
*  100% of the people that don't go up [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7824.400000000001s)]
*  that fucking stupid mountain. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7825.780000000001s)]
*  Just get a fucking Oculus and watch that shit. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7827.400000000001s)]
*  Just watch it. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7831.0s)]
*  Watch it in your head. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7831.88s)]
*  You can get videos of it. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7833.14s)]
*  340 people have died attempting to reach [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7835.360000000001s)]
*  what happened? [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7837.8s)]
*  Oh, Mount Everest. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7838.72s)]
*  Since records began, many bodies remain. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7840.84s)]
*  Have you ever seen the bodies scattered, [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7843.3s)]
*  like the map of the bodies where they show [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7845.22s)]
*  where the known dead bodies on Mount Everest are? [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7847.36s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7850.24s)]
*  Do you wanna know the craziest one? [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7851.4s)]
*  Sure. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7852.72s)]
*  So the first dude to ever attempt the assignment, [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7853.5599999999995s)]
*  I think his name was Mallory, right? [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7855.92s)]
*  Evan Hillary is the one who got it. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7857.76s)]
*  So they said, they found his body [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7859.48s)]
*  probably like five years after, 10 years after, [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7863.28s)]
*  and they said he had a broken leg, [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7865.84s)]
*  a fractured skull, and his pick. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7867.12s)]
*  And that's how they could figure out it was him [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7869.4400000000005s)]
*  because his initials were in his pick. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7870.92s)]
*  And they said he always carried a picture of his wife [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7872.68s)]
*  because he was gonna put the picture of his wife [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7875.6s)]
*  on the top of Mount Everest, and it wasn't in his pocket. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7877.08s)]
*  So they're like, was he in fact the first person [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7880.360000000001s)]
*  to get there? [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7883.7s)]
*  Oh, probably. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7884.54s)]
*  And then he left it there and then died [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7885.52s)]
*  on the coming down. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7886.92s)]
*  Probably. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7888.320000000001s)]
*  The other thing that I think is wild [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7889.16s)]
*  is Sir Evan Hillary and Tenzing Norgay [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7891.16s)]
*  made a deal that they would reach the summit [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7896.08s)]
*  at the same time. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7898.32s)]
*  Because it was like, who gets to the summit first? [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7900.16s)]
*  And it's a, I mean, when you think about it, [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7903.36s)]
*  especially with racism back then, [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7905.5199999999995s)]
*  Evan Hillary was a Kiwi, and you know, [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7907.28s)]
*  he must've been like, hey, brown guy, [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7908.5599999999995s)]
*  just carry the bags, I'm gonna get up there, [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7909.9s)]
*  and you come up, get a picture of me, [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7912.08s)]
*  and then we'll do it one together, [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7913.28s)]
*  and then we'll let it down. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7914.32s)]
*  But they made a deal to go up together [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7915.599999999999s)]
*  because they needed him that much. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7917.24s)]
*  Well, you definitely need, those Sherpas [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7919.4s)]
*  can go all the way up there with no oxygen. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7920.839999999999s)]
*  Those Sherpas will get locked on a ledge [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7922.36s)]
*  with a bunch of white people. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7924.78s)]
*  The white people have to have helicopters come out [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7927.04s)]
*  and get them, a helicopter I think can only get to like, [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7929.0s)]
*  2,300 feet, 23,000 feet is like the safe zone. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7931.839999999999s)]
*  They'll come and get the white people out, [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7936.32s)]
*  and then the Sherpas are like, oh, [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7937.96s)]
*  we're gonna walk down, we're good. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7938.799999999999s)]
*  They'll hang out for like seven days up there, [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7940.759999999999s)]
*  and then I just heard a documentary about it, [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7942.759999999999s)]
*  or a podcast. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7945.08s)]
*  But those guys are so fucking good at it. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7946.76s)]
*  Also, they're so adapted to that climate. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7949.64s)]
*  They live up there. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7951.88s)]
*  That, the adaption is a big part of it, right? [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=7953.4800000000005s)]

*  And it was being shared on the internet [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8149.42s)]

*  there were restrictions on what we could give our kids [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8157.94s)]
*  to school. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8160.7s)]

*  but you didn't know you were in a competition? [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8504.18s)]
*  Yeah, that's unfortunate. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8506.02s)]
*  That's unfortunate. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8507.42s)]
*  Inspired by is a better way to look at life. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8508.26s)]
*  Competing is just not good for you. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8511.539999999999s)]
*  I've never once competed with another comic. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8513.38s)]
*  I've been inspired by so many fucking comics. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8515.58s)]
*  That's good. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8518.14s)]
*  You have a healthy mindset. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8518.98s)]
*  But I think our whole group has a healthy mindset. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8519.98s)]
*  I think so. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8522.34s)]
*  Yeah, we don't have any cunts. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8523.18s)]
*  We don't have any jealous, bitter cunts [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8524.859999999999s)]
*  in the group of people that we're hanging with. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8527.14s)]
*  I mean- [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8529.14s)]
*  That's so important. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8529.98s)]
*  I hung with Chappelle one night [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8530.82s)]
*  and he just called, I was in Dayton. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8532.26s)]
*  He was like, yo, why don't you come out and party? [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8535.02s)]
*  And I was like, cool. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8536.699999999999s)]
*  And then we went out and partied. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8538.38s)]
*  And I kind of forget what a fan I am of his. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8539.699999999999s)]
*  Of just how great he is. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8542.18s)]
*  I mean, his kicker in the pussy joke [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8544.5s)]
*  might be one of my favorite jokes ever [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8545.859999999999s)]
*  that's taken me to the next level. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8547.3s)]
*  I mean, I think it's the best joke [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8549.26s)]
*  that's ever been written. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8550.140000000001s)]
*  It's so fucking dope. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8550.980000000001s)]
*  He's a great comic, but he's a great human. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8552.26s)]
*  He's a great human. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8554.18s)]
*  He's a fun hang. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8555.02s)]
*  He's a genuine sweetheart of a guy. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8555.86s)]
*  I was with him right before I shot the special [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8558.220000000001s)]
*  and I said to him, and we're fucking lit, right? [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8560.660000000002s)]
*  And I go, yo, Dave, I don't want to fucking, [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8563.58s)]
*  I don't want to talk shop. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8566.1s)]
*  I just want to hang, but I gotta say, [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8567.460000000001s)]
*  you're the greatest ever, do it. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8569.300000000001s)]
*  I'm getting ready to shoot my special. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8570.58s)]
*  I just would love a little bit of your insight [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8572.380000000001s)]
*  of what you think, like how you prepare for one. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8574.660000000002s)]
*  And he's like, all right. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8577.98s)]
*  How many shows? [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8580.18s)]
*  I said six. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8581.14s)]
*  He goes, perfect. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8581.98s)]
*  Here's, and then he breaks down. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8583.619999999999s)]
*  I'm not gonna do it because it's Dave's secret. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8584.539999999999s)]
*  It's Dave's thing. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8586.34s)]
*  He shared, I don't want to, [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8587.18s)]
*  but he broke down how he does a special to me, [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8588.18s)]
*  me and him sitting in a fucking, in a barn [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8591.779999999999s)]
*  in the middle of a field in fucking three in the morning [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8594.18s)]
*  with IVs in our arms. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8596.9s)]
*  And I was like, dude, I gave him a hug. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8598.699999999999s)]
*  I was like, he's just saying he's the fucking greatest. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8601.38s)]
*  Him and Cat Williams, two of the baddest motherfuckers [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8603.619999999999s)]
*  and the sweetest guys. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8606.26s)]
*  But I was like, that energy, I have no, [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8608.02s)]
*  I want Chappelle's special to be fucking amazing [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8610.58s)]
*  when it comes out. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8613.74s)]
*  Everyone's telling me how great Schultz's special is. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8614.94s)]
*  I can't wait to fucking watch it. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8617.34s)]
*  Yeah, but you have a good attitude. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8619.26s)]
*  That's a good attitude. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8620.58s)]
*  That's how you're supposed to think. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8621.62s)]
*  That's how I think, but. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8623.42s)]
*  It's not, the other way is not good for you. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8625.22s)]
*  Let me see that. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8627.9s)]
*  The thing about it is the other way is, [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8628.74s)]
*  you want another one, you want a new one? [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8629.94s)]
*  Yeah, I'll take a new one. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8631.14s)]
*  The other way is bad for you as a human. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8631.98s)]
*  It's not healthy to think that way. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8635.5s)]
*  It doesn't do you any good. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8637.42s)]
*  It only serves you to get fucked up. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8639.26s)]
*  It only serves your ego and your bullshit. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8642.34s)]
*  You got the clippers on the back? [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8645.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8647.3s)]
*  Ego, man. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8649.3s)]
*  It's just not good for you. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8650.14s)]
*  It doesn't help you. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8650.98s)]
*  It only hurts you. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8652.42s)]
*  It doesn't hurt the person that you're jealous of [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8653.38s)]
*  and it hurts you. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8655.94s)]
*  It's just, it's not necessary. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8657.22s)]
*  You could just be inspired and you could say, [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8658.74s)]
*  oh, this fucking mutt can make it. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8662.38s)]
*  You can say that. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8664.18s)]
*  I can do it too, but don't be jealous. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8665.66s)]
*  If you don't like someone [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8667.460000000001s)]
*  and they're becoming very successful, [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8668.74s)]
*  maybe think why you react so strongly [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8671.78s)]
*  because a lot of times it's unfortunately jealousy. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8675.66s)]
*  Like there's comics that I don't think they're very good. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8678.66s)]
*  They don't make me laugh, but I don't care. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8681.9s)]
*  I don't get mad at them. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8684.300000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8685.94s)]
*  I don't get upset at them. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8687.34s)]
*  I mean, I'll be friends with them. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8689.18s)]
*  I'll be, I'll like them. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8690.7s)]
*  There's comics that I, and I had to learn how to do that [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8693.02s)]
*  because it used to be like, if guys weren't funny, [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8695.82s)]
*  I just couldn't deal with them. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8697.7s)]
*  Couldn't hang out with them. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8699.06s)]
*  I'm friends with a few people that suck, [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8699.9s)]
*  but they're nice people. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8702.74s)]
*  You could separate that, [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8704.62s)]
*  but I'm also friends with some people that are mind blowing [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8706.1s)]
*  and there's such a value in that. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8710.300000000001s)]
*  When you're around people that are like really good [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8713.14s)]
*  at what they do, when you're around Dave [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8715.9s)]
*  and Schultz is my favorite for going to a place [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8718.1s)]
*  and then talking shit about the place [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8723.78s)]
*  in such a brilliant way. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8726.02s)]
*  I think Schultz is fucking brilliant. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8727.62s)]
*  He's so good. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8729.140000000001s)]
*  Dude, the whole shit with Kendrick Lamar. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8729.98s)]
*  I was getting in the shower, reading it, texting him. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8731.82s)]
*  I'm sitting outside the shower, [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8734.66s)]
*  texting him my favorite lines. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8735.66s)]
*  The only thing he has to do is decide if it's consensual. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8738.140000000001s)]
*  That was crazy. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8741.94s)]
*  I fucking, but I get inspired by motherfuckers like that. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8742.78s)]
*  He's a funny dude, man. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8746.54s)]
*  Did you ever see the thing he did about Hawaii? [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8748.34s)]
*  No. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8750.98s)]
*  Oh my God, it's so funny. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8751.82s)]
*  He's in Hawaii. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8752.86s)]
*  He starts to set up, he goes, [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8753.7s)]
*  I've never seen chickens more confident. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8755.74s)]
*  He does this whole bit about chickens in Hawaii, [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8760.82s)]
*  just wandered, it's such a funny bit. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8766.74s)]
*  If you've been to Hawaii, you know there's chickens [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8770.22s)]
*  all over the fucking place. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8771.9s)]
*  It's kind of crazy. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8772.74s)]
*  Do you know who else does that? [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8773.58s)]
*  Tommy. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8774.62s)]
*  Oh yeah, Tommy. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8775.66s)]
*  He shits on a place so aggressively and they love it. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8776.5s)]
*  He did Dublin one year, same way we both did it. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8781.26s)]
*  He goes, is it fun? [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8784.06s)]

*  Thank you. Yeah, they arrest people over there. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8847.26s)]
*  I know. You can't play games in Dubai. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8849.02s)]
*  Did you see that one lady who went crazy at the airport? [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8850.62s)]
*  No. Yeah, she got a little rowdy at the airport [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8854.1s)]
*  and started yelling at people and they're like, [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8857.86s)]
*  that's a wrap. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8859.18s)]
*  You're going to jail. Dude. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8860.94s)]
*  They'll fuck around over there, man. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8862.82s)]

*  and he's a documentary filmmaker, [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8867.18s)]
*  and he said it's so safe over here. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8869.1s)]
*  He goes, that's what I love about it. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8871.1s)]
*  He goes, when I was in America, [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8872.22s)]
*  I was like, you go out at night, you're at a club, [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8873.38s)]
*  you're always worried someone's gonna pull a gun out, [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8875.66s)]
*  something's gonna happen. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8877.3s)]
*  He goes, there, there's nothing. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8878.46s)]
*  Yeah. No crime. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8879.9s)]
*  But it's like Singapore, there's crazy rules. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8880.82s)]
*  Right, but what would you- [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8883.26s)]
*  And if you don't know all the rules- [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8884.1s)]
*  It's the real good question. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8884.94s)]
*  Would you rather have a little bit of danger [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8885.94s)]
*  and very little rules, [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8889.26s)]
*  or would you rather have no danger and a lot of rules? [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8890.74s)]
*  I want a little danger and a little rule. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8894.1s)]
*  I agree. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8895.859999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want to live in a place [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8896.939999999999s)]
*  where they restrict what you could say and what you do. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8898.06s)]
*  It's not even that. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8899.699999999999s)]
*  They said to me in the contract, [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8900.539999999999s)]
*  we signed up to do, I do a tour starting in October, [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8902.38s)]
*  permission to party. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8905.18s)]
*  Permission to party is the name of the fucking tour. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8906.42s)]
*  Permission to party. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8908.74s)]
*  And they go, what about Dubai? [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8909.66s)]
*  I go, I don't think they're gonna give me permission. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8910.82s)]
*  I think they're gonna do. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8912.82s)]
*  The first thing was you have to wear a shirt on stage. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8914.98s)]
*  And I was like- Yeah, that's a wrap. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8917.3s)]
*  I go, hey man, that's kind of my thing. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8918.46s)]
*  Like, I'm comfortable shirtless. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8920.38s)]
*  That's how I perform. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8923.460000000001s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8924.460000000001s)]
*  You can't wear no shirt. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8926.02s)]
*  You guys have crazy rules. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8929.380000000001s)]
*  Those rules don't make sense. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8930.86s)]
*  Like what about Cirque du Soleil? [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8932.62s)]
*  They have to have, they wear shirts? [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8934.140000000001s)]
*  They do. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8935.820000000002s)]
*  They do, I'm making that up. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8936.86s)]
*  Like what about MMA? [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8938.18s)]
*  How come they have MMA over there? [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8940.02s)]
*  How can they have MMA? [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8941.7s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8943.34s)]
*  Are they performing with no shirts on? [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8944.7s)]
*  You're gonna make guys wear fucking wetsuits? [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8946.42s)]
*  What are you gonna wear? [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8948.980000000001s)]
*  What are they gonna wear? [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8950.060000000001s)]
*  That's the same argument I said [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8953.14s)]
*  as I got kicked out of a Buffalo Wild Wings [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8954.34s)]
*  with my shirt off. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8956.460000000001s)]
*  And they're like, put your shirt on. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8957.3s)]
*  I go, the guys don't have MMA, [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8958.14s)]
*  they're wearing fucking shirts. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8958.98s)]
*  Yeah, that's different. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8960.18s)]
*  Is it a little different? [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8961.02s)]
*  That's different. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8961.86s)]
*  They're doing it in a sport. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8962.7s)]
*  But the point is, if you're performing, [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8963.54s)]
*  that's part of your performance. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8964.94s)]
*  It's like, you know how there's rules in LA? [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8965.94s)]
*  Like if you performed on stage, [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8968.66s)]
*  you were allowed to smoke cigarettes? [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8970.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8971.7s)]
*  That's a part of your performance. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8972.54s)]
*  So like Chappelle was always lighting up [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8973.38s)]
*  even after the rules. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8974.66s)]
*  And everybody was like, hey, how come he can smoke? [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8975.86s)]
*  Because it was like in the 90s [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8978.02s)]
*  that they passed the laws [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8980.42s)]
*  where you're not allowed to smoke in comedy clubs anymore. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8982.539999999999s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8983.939999999999s)]
*  Yeah, if it was part of your act, you could smoke. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8984.779999999999s)]
*  Rassel Roddenweig smoked cigars on stage. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8986.34s)]
*  Right, but there was a law before that [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8988.58s)]
*  you were allowed to smoke in bars. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8990.859999999999s)]
*  I remember doing standup when you could smoke [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8992.82s)]
*  at the Boston Comedy Club. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8994.859999999999s)]
*  And Buddy, do you remember the laugh stop in Houston? [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=8996.3s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9000.14s)]
*  That place, there were so many cigarettes [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9000.98s)]
*  you would come out with a cough. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9003.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the air was filled with smoke. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9005.42s)]
*  Your jeans would smell. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9007.38s)]
*  Oh yeah, you always smelled. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9008.699999999999s)]
*  I always come home from a club back in the 90s [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9009.980000000001s)]
*  and I'd smell my clothes. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9012.980000000001s)]
*  They always smell like cigarettes. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9013.94s)]
*  But you got used to the smoky room. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9015.66s)]
*  It was part of the thing about a comedy club [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9017.82s)]
*  is when people smoke cigarettes, [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9019.86s)]
*  they're doing something really stupid. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9021.86s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9023.980000000001s)]
*  And doing something really stupid is they fuck it. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9024.82s)]
*  There's so much fuck it in a cigarette [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9026.5s)]
*  and there's fuck it in a drink [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9028.26s)]
*  and there's fuck it in this guy talking shit on stage. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9029.86s)]
*  Ah, he sucked his own dick, ah! [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9032.18s)]
*  It led to the atmosphere. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9034.94s)]
*  I loved it in pool halls too. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9036.980000000001s)]
*  I loved being around the smokers [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9039.060000000001s)]
*  even if I didn't want to have anything to do with it. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9040.78s)]

*  During like Mo' Better Mondays or something. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9332.74s)]
*  Rose was there when it happened. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9334.38s)]
*  Rose saw the guy die. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9336.14s)]
*  Oh shit. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9337.66s)]
*  That's, that's. [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9340.779999999999s)]
*  That place has always attracted crazy people. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9343.02s)]
*  That place has always, [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9346.3s)]
*  I think there's an energy to that place [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9347.3s)]
*  probably because of the gang history [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9349.26s)]
*  that just made it extra wild and dangerous. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9352.1s)]
*  Just always felt like anything can happen in that place. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9355.26s)]
*  I think there's like baked in memories. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9359.62s)]
*  There's photos of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis on stage there. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9361.820000000002s)]
*  That place was like, that was the spot. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9366.820000000002s)]
*  That was the spot in LA and the mob would all be there [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9369.900000000001s)]
*  and they'd fucking do deals, whack people, [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9372.980000000001s)]
*  and take people down the basement and fucking kill them. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9376.26s)]
*  That's out of all the scariness in movies, [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9379.58s)]
*  the scariest part of any movie is one of those mob movies [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9381.94s)]
*  where they say to the guy, [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9385.02s)]
*  hey Johnny wants to talk to you tonight. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9386.660000000002s)]
*  The guy's like, tell Johnny I'm calling tomorrow. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9389.1s)]
*  He's like, no, he said to get in the car now. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9390.300000000001s)]
*  The guy goes, well, I'll take my car. [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9392.140000000001s)]
*  He goes, no, no, you're gonna get in the car with us. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9393.42s)]
*  And you know. [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9395.140000000001s)]
*  That guy's gonna die. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9396.060000000001s)]
*  Looks at his friend, takes off his ring, [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9397.78s)]
*  gives it to him and I don't know. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9399.980000000001s)]
*  I'm such a bitch that if in those moments I'd be like, [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9403.18s)]
*  no, I don't wanna go. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9405.86s)]
*  And just start running. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9406.7s)]
*  Or like when you see in the war movies, [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9408.26s)]
*  when you see, like in, what was the one, 1917, [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9410.1s)]
*  when they tell those two kids they gotta run [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9415.26s)]
*  and go tell the front line what to do? [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9417.460000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. Is that 1917? [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9419.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9420.98s)]
*  It's not, it's all part of the Western Front. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9421.82s)]
*  Like my grandfather stormed the beaches of Normandy. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9423.460000000001s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9426.1s)]
*  And. Did you ever talk to him about it? [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9427.1s)]
*  No, he died way before I was born. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9428.86s)]
*  Holy shit. He was one of those [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9430.82s)]
*  PTSD, Levittown, guys. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9432.300000000001s)]
*  Moved to Levittown and my dad said he just would sit [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9435.22s)]
*  in the garage, drink beers and listen to Met Games [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9437.9s)]
*  and just wash his car. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9440.5s)]
*  My dad said he never heard his dad ever mention the war [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9442.820000000002s)]
*  and if the war was brought up, [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9446.140000000001s)]
*  his dad would walk out of the room. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9447.1s)]
*  But he stormed the beaches of Normandy and [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9448.820000000002s)]
*  I don't know, I don't know if I have the thing in me [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9452.86s)]
*  to get off the boat. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9457.62s)]
*  I think I'm a bitch. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9459.300000000001s)]
*  I think I'd be like, I'd lock down. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9460.140000000001s)]
*  I'd be like, I'm not getting off. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9462.060000000001s)]
*  When you look at guys like Janko. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9463.5s)]
*  I think you had to get off that boat, buddy. [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9465.1s)]
*  I don't think you had a choice. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9467.060000000001s)]
*  And I think when your friends are running off that boat, [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9468.820000000002s)]
*  you run off that boat too and guys are getting gunned down [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9471.1s)]
*  you just hope it's not you [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9473.42s)]
*  and you're probably just shit in your pants. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9474.74s)]
*  Shitting my pants. [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9476.9s)]
*  And that one day, how many thousands of people died? [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9477.86s)]
*  Thousands and thousands of people died. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9482.78s)]
*  Just bullets and guns going off everywhere. [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9484.66s)]
*  That fucking movie, the- [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9487.58s)]
*  Saving Private Ryan. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9490.380000000001s)]
*  Yes, Spielberg nailed that movie. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9491.220000000001s)]
*  That opening scene was so fucking horrific [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9494.9s)]
*  that you'd never seen a scene like that in a war movie [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9498.34s)]
*  that accurately depicts people getting torn apart [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9500.98s)]
*  right in front of you. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9504.18s)]
*  My dad found his dad's diary from the war [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9507.5s)]
*  and he photocopied it and sent me the photocopy. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9511.02s)]
*  My dad has the diary. [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9513.98s)]
*  And it's funny because my memory is jaded [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9516.22s)]
*  to how I find things interesting. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9521.06s)]
*  So sometimes it's not 100% accurate. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9523.06s)]
*  But in there, there was a memory of like, [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9525.1s)]
*  they took one of these like Q boats, I think, [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9527.66s)]
*  or K boats across the fucking Atlantic over to England, [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9529.900000000001s)]
*  barely had time to get off the boat, [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9533.980000000001s)]
*  stayed in England for a second. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9535.980000000001s)]
*  I think they, I wanna say they stayed on the boat [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9536.94s)]
*  the whole time and then took that same boat over to, [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9539.18s)]
*  or they probably took different boats, [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9541.82s)]
*  but took a boat over to Normandy. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9543.02s)]
*  And my dad's, my grandfather's entry [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9544.5s)]
*  is something to the effect of, [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9547.300000000001s)]
*  we're going to this, we're storming this beach today. [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9549.02s)]
*  Like they didn't, I don't think he knew [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9551.78s)]
*  like what the levity or the seriousness [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9554.060000000001s)]
*  of what was happening. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9556.7s)]
*  I think they were like, [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9557.54s)]
*  like he just very casually mentioned it. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9558.58s)]
*  Oh God. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9560.38s)]
*  And the only other thing I remember [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9561.42s)]
*  out of reading that diary was that he would, [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9563.38s)]
*  he would get water in his helmet, it was so cold, [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9566.74s)]
*  he'd get water in his helmet to shave. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9569.26s)]
*  And by the time he went to shave, [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9570.94s)]
*  he had to break the, it would freeze over with ice. [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9572.02s)]
*  He had to break it with his razor. [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9574.38s)]
*  But to think that, I mean, just the amount of trauma [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9576.14s)]
*  that those guys went through [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9579.34s)]
*  and no one really cared about it. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9580.34s)]
*  They were like, just have a fucking shot of scotch. [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9581.82s)]
*  And that was the second time the world had gone to war. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9585.26s)]
*  The world had gone to war just a couple of decades earlier. [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9589.42s)]
*  Dude, can I tell you what fucking makes me, [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9592.699999999999s)]
*  like makes me stop for a second? [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9595.26s)]
*  When we were in Serbia, [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9597.699999999999s)]
*  they have statues of Gavriil Pritsip everywhere. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9599.26s)]
*  He's the guy that shot Franz Ferdinand, the Archduke. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9602.019999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9605.42s)]
*  They have statues of him everywhere. [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9606.26s)]
*  He's a fucking national hero in Serbia [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9607.46s)]
*  because he technically created Yugoslavia. [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9610.06s)]
*  I mean, people have, [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9613.419999999998s)]
*  they wear shirts of Gavriil Pritsip. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9614.5s)]
*  They have wallets of this guy, movie producer. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9616.74s)]
*  He started World War I. [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9619.22s)]
*  He started, he changed the world forever. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9620.06s)]
*  That one man is responsible for millions of deaths [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9623.98s)]
*  and so much suffering. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9627.699999999999s)]
*  That one man. Isn't that crazy? [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9630.099999999999s)]
*  And they have statues of this dude. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9631.179999999998s)]
*  Statues everywhere. [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9632.619999999999s)]
*  Dude, some guy, I got obsessed with it [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9633.859999999999s)]
*  because I was like, I can't believe you guys, [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9636.019999999999s)]
*  like we consider that a terrorist in our country. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=9637.46s)]

*  But I mean, to tap a guy like Kevin Holland, [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10183.679999999998s)]
*  and not just tap him, but just, [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10186.84s)]
*  he has no chance at any moment in the fight. [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10189.279999999999s)]
*  It's just total grappling dominance. [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10191.56s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10193.64s)]
*  He's a monster. [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10196.0s)]
*  Just a fucking monster. [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10197.199999999999s)]
*  And like the most aggressive guy in the fucking sport. [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10198.2s)]
*  Like right away charges, and this is it. [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10202.800000000001s)]
*  This is the end. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10204.960000000001s)]
*  Once he taps him. [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10205.800000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10206.640000000001s)]
*  Once he gets that leg over the top of the body, [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10207.720000000001s)]
*  so he isolates the body and constricts deeper [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10209.560000000001s)]
*  into the choke, he's done. [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10211.960000000001s)]
*  Dude, I got choked out by my daughter, Isla. [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10213.640000000001s)]
*  Oh no. [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10216.84s)]
*  Yeah, we were on vacation. [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10217.68s)]
*  Were you trying not to get choked out? [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10218.720000000001s)]
*  No, she's a girl, so I thought, she's talking shit. [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10220.02s)]
*  Eddie Bravo's got her private jujitsu lessons. [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10223.640000000001s)]
*  So she's been taking jujitsu in her fucking gym. [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10227.4s)]
*  And she's dyslexic, so she can never tell you [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10230.119999999999s)]
*  the right move she's about to do. [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10233.6s)]
*  And we're on vacation, and she goes, [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10235.359999999999s)]
*  it'll be easy, you have to slow down there, big guy. [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10239.16s)]
*  I'll choke you out. [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10241.199999999999s)]
*  And I was like, oh, you're gonna choke me out? [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10242.039999999999s)]
*  She goes, it's easier to choke out big guys. [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10243.199999999999s)]
*  And I went, really? [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10246.76s)]
*  She goes, I find it easier. [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10248.48s)]
*  And I was like, okay. [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10249.8s)]
*  I was like, try to choke me out. [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10251.06s)]
*  Joe, this little needle arm went around my neck, [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10252.68s)]
*  and I swear to God, what is she, [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10255.779999999999s)]
*  I was like 15 at the time, I just went, oh, I tapped. [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10258.0s)]
*  She was like, yeah, that's what I thought. [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10260.36s)]
*  I was like, my daughter. [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10261.52s)]
*  That's what I thought she said. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10262.640000000001s)]
*  I was like, thought, dude. [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10263.880000000001s)]
*  Disrespect. [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10265.560000000001s)]
*  She did, she met Eddie Bravo. [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10267.320000000002s)]
*  She met Eddie Bravo at our house one night, [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10269.92s)]
*  and you know, Eddie, me, Sam Tripoli, [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10271.720000000001s)]
*  Eddie and I are lit, right? [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10273.880000000001s)]
*  And we're in the kitchen, we've just done a podcast, [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10275.480000000001s)]
*  and Isla comes in, she's like, who's this guy? [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10278.28s)]
*  And I go, this is Eddie Bravo. [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10281.08s)]
*  She goes, okay. [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10282.94s)]
*  I was like, he teaches jujitsu. [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10284.28s)]
*  She goes, I wanna learn jujitsu. [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10286.480000000001s)]
*  And Eddie goes, really? [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10287.960000000001s)]
*  And she goes, yeah, a little bit of that. [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10289.2s)]
*  Hi-ya! [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10290.44s)]
*  And Eddie goes, that's not jujitsu. [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10291.28s)]
*  She goes, whatever it is, I wanna learn it. [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10294.28s)]
*  So he goes, all right, I'll set you up. [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10295.74s)]
*  And he got her this lady that came over to the house [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10297.2s)]
*  like three times a week. [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10299.28s)]
*  Oh wow, that's amazing. [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10300.6s)]
*  Got Matt in the back, and Isla loved it. [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10301.44s)]
*  Isla loved it. [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10303.960000000001s)]
*  Except she turned the Nest Cam around [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10304.800000000001s)]
*  so we couldn't watch her jujitsu lessons. [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10307.28s)]
*  Oh, that's funny. [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10309.08s)]
*  She was like, I don't want you to watch what I do. [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10309.92s)]
*  I just wanna learn it. [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10312.640000000001s)]
*  That's cool. [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10314.4s)]
*  Yeah, it was really cool. [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10315.24s)]
*  It's a very good thing for women to learn [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10316.08s)]
*  because jujitsu allows you to defend yourself [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10317.4s)]
*  in a way that very few martial arts really do [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10320.28s)]
*  because you don't have to rely on the size of your hands [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10323.039999999999s)]
*  hitting people and kicking people. [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10325.38s)]
*  It's too hard. [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10327.8s)]
*  It's too hard to knock out a man. [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10328.64s)]
*  Like if you have small hands, if you're a woman, [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10330.66s)]
*  it's just like you can't generate enough force [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10332.56s)]
*  for the most part unless you're like an unusually [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10335.34s)]
*  strong woman. [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10337.28s)]
*  Some women, like there's a few, like Holly Holm. [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10338.22s)]
*  Like you don't want Holly Holm punching you in the face. [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10343.48s)]
*  Amanda Nunes will knock you out cold 100% [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10345.44s)]
*  even if you're a dude. [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10348.12s)]
*  But most women, they just don't have the power [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10349.24s)]
*  in their hands. [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10351.460000000001s)]
*  But everyone has the power to carry your body around. [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10352.62s)]
*  So your legs are really strong. [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10355.6s)]
*  If a woman gets her fucking legs locked around your neck [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10356.880000000001s)]
*  and gets a triangle on you, you're fucked. [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10359.08s)]
*  If she knows how to do jujitsu, [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10361.52s)]
*  like your legs are carrying, [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10363.04s)]
*  if you weigh 130 pounds, you're a woman, [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10364.82s)]
*  your legs are carrying 130 pounds all day long [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10366.560000000001s)]
*  and they don't get tired and they're strong. [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10369.36s)]
*  So all you have to do is like, [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10371.94s)]
*  lock that bitch in behind the knee, crack, [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10374.06s)]
*  and pull on the head and you're gonna sleep. [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10376.62s)]
*  You're gonna sleep, dog. [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10378.9s)]
*  She could've put me to sleep. [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10379.98s)]
*  I bet she could've. [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10381.380000000001s)]
*  I've been fucking humiliating. [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10382.62s)]
*  There was a show that they used to have on Showtime [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10384.66s)]
*  with this dude who was, he was a porn star [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10388.220000000001s)]
*  and he had a show on Showtime. [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10390.58s)]
*  And he had like a reality show. [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10392.2s)]
*  And in one of the episodes, he was gonna do jujitsu [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10395.460000000001s)]
*  with a woman. [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10399.34s)]
*  And so my friend Felicia, [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10400.5s)]
*  Felicia Oh, who's a black belt under John Jacques Machado, [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10402.380000000001s)]
*  she's a legit beast. [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10404.94s)]
*  And she weighs 130 pounds, maybe, maybe 135, maybe. [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10407.3s)]
*  And she choked the fuck out of this dude [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10412.58s)]
*  like multiple times. [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10415.66s)]
*  I don't even think she was a black belt at the time. [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10417.36s)]
*  She was probably a brown belt. [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10419.62s)]
*  Maybe she was a black belt already. [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10421.62s)]
*  She was a black belt before me. [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10423.26s)]
*  But I used to train with her all the time. [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10424.7s)]
*  She's really, really good. [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10426.880000000001s)]
*  And a dude who didn't know what he's doing, [[02:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10428.94s)]
*  he's going night night. [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10430.5s)]
*  It's amazing how many dudes don't know what they're doing. [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10432.1s)]
*  Most people don't. [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10434.460000000001s)]
*  Most people. [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10435.300000000001s)]
*  It's too hard to learn. [[02:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10436.12s)]
*  And you gotta get humiliated when you do learn. [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10437.140000000001s)]
*  You get fucking humiliated. [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10439.820000000002s)]
*  It's a brutal wake up call when you get strangled. [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10441.820000000002s)]
*  And how easy it is for people to do it to you. [[02:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10446.02s)]
*  You're so vulnerable when you're unconscious. [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10448.7s)]
*  Well, you're just so vulnerable when you do jujitsu [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10450.92s)]
*  against someone who's good at it. [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10453.02s)]
*  I remember the first time I realized I was a white belt [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10454.42s)]
*  and I rolled with this kid, he was a purple belt, [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10456.86s)]
*  and he was my size and he just mauled me. [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10458.62s)]
*  And I remember thinking, this is crazy. [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10462.06s)]
*  I can't believe I'm totally helpless. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10463.66s)]
*  I thought I had this delusional idea. [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10466.22s)]
*  I know how to fight. [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10468.22s)]
*  I'll fucking figure this out. [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10469.06s)]
*  This ain't that big a deal. [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10470.14s)]
*  It's not that much different from taekwondo or kickboxing. [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10471.18s)]
*  Delusional. [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10475.58s)]
*  I got strangled over and over again by everybody. [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10476.5s)]
*  But this one guy in particular, he just was murdering me. [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10479.02s)]
*  And I remember thinking, I gotta learn this. [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10481.9s)]
*  This is really important to know. [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10485.18s)]
*  I didn't know how it was that vulnerable. [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10487.38s)]
*  Have you gotten choked unconscious? [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10488.66s)]
*  No, never unconscious. [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10490.06s)]
*  I always tap. [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10491.62s)]
*  Oh, that's terrifying. [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10492.460000000001s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10493.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta tap. [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10494.140000000001s)]
*  It's terrifying because you get that moment [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10494.98s)]
*  where you're like, uh, uh, uh. [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10496.300000000001s)]
*  I definitely sparked out a couple of times [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10499.5s)]
*  where I could see the door was closing. [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10501.34s)]
*  You have a second left before you go out, before you tap. [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10504.66s)]
*  And when someone's got a really good rear naked choke, [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10508.460000000001s)]
*  once it's locked in and they start to clamp down, [[02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10511.220000000001s)]
*  you gotta fucking tap. [[02:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10514.34s)]
*  You gotta tap. [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10515.98s)]
*  Especially in training, it's stupid to not tap [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10516.94s)]
*  because you could really get hurt, [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10519.86s)]
*  especially if you get caught in an arm bar, [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10521.22s)]
*  or worse is like a heel hook or a knee bar. [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10522.86s)]
*  Like you gotta tap immediately. [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10525.18s)]
*  You can't take a chance with ripping your joint apart. [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10527.18s)]
*  It's not worth it. [[02:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10530.3s)]
*  Fuck that. [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10532.5s)]
*  And I had a lot of injuries from not tapping in time. [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10533.42s)]
*  I had a bad camora injury on my elbow. [[02:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10535.76s)]
*  My friend Brent caught me in a camora [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10538.58s)]
*  and I couldn't believe that he got it. [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10540.14s)]
*  I was like, cause I usually get him. [[02:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10542.18s)]
*  I was like, I am gonna get him. [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10543.98s)]
*  And then he got me. [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10545.5s)]
*  I'm like, oh my God, he got me. [[02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10546.34s)]
*  This motherfucker got me and I didn't wanna tap. [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10547.46s)]
*  And I was trying to work my way out of it [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10549.3s)]
*  and work my way out of it. [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10550.74s)]
*  And eventually I had to tap and I was like, [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10551.74s)]
*  oh, I fucked my elbow up. [[02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10553.5s)]
*  And I couldn't do chin ups for like three months. [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10554.939999999999s)]
*  Really? [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10557.179999999998s)]
*  It was brutal. [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10558.019999999999s)]
*  It was horrible. [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10558.84s)]
*  Every time I do a chin up, I have agony in my left elbow. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10559.679999999998s)]
*  Do you still roll? [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10561.66s)]
*  No. [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10562.58s)]
*  Is that cause you're back? [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10563.58s)]
*  No, I want to again, but I've had a few aggravating injuries. [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10564.42s)]
*  I had some sciatica a while back, [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10569.5s)]
*  like real stiffness in the back. [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10571.779999999999s)]
*  But you know what's really changed that a lot? [[02:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10572.98s)]
*  Is stretching. [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10575.619999999999s)]
*  I've spent like an hour and a half every night [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10576.86s)]
*  just stretching. [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10579.62s)]
*  Really? [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10580.74s)]
*  Yeah, I loosened everything up. [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10581.58s)]
*  And I realized like, sometimes I go too hard [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10583.72s)]
*  and I don't give myself enough recovery. [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10587.48s)]
*  I just push a little too far. [[02:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10590.42s)]
*  And then I ignore, like I had this back thing [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10591.9s)]
*  that was bothering me from archery and I just ignored it. [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10594.3s)]
*  And it was just a muscle thing. [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10598.1s)]
*  So I wasn't worried about it. [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10599.62s)]
*  Where is it? [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10601.14s)]
*  Like right in the center of your back or the right? [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10601.98s)]
*  No, my right on the side. [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10603.36s)]
*  It's on the side by the hips. [[02:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10606.06s)]
*  So I know. [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10608.58s)]
*  Oh, lower, lower. [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10609.42s)]
*  Right, so I know it's not worrying me like a spine thing. [[02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10610.26s)]
*  Spine things worry me. [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10612.74s)]
*  But this was inflamed and I just kept shooting the bow. [[02:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10614.34s)]
*  I just was like, shut up pussy. [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10617.619999999999s)]
*  And I just, I pushed it to the point [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10619.06s)]
*  where it got kind of chronic. [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10620.779999999999s)]
*  And it bothered me for a while. [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10622.74s)]
*  It's much, much better now. [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10623.98s)]
*  But I'm being real careful to get it to 100% [[02:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10626.74s)]
*  before I think about doing anything. [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10629.619999999999s)]
*  Like right now I can kick the bag again. [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10631.06s)]
*  I can do pretty much everything again. [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10633.06s)]
*  But it's one of those things [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10635.22s)]
*  where I'm still getting better. [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10636.06s)]
*  When you say stretching, [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10639.22s)]
*  because after we did the, I did so much working out, [[02:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10640.22s)]
*  I had a masseuse come in and kind of test my flexibility [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10644.179999999998s)]
*  because I had some problems in my forearm. [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10647.98s)]
*  And my shoulder can't go, I can't get it past this. [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10650.179999999998s)]
*  And this one goes way. [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10654.38s)]
*  Do you have an injury? [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10656.06s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10657.0s)]
*  I have no fucking idea. [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10657.84s)]
*  I think it's no recovery and no stretching. [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10658.679999999998s)]
*  I do no stretching. [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10661.859999999999s)]
*  Benching's rough on the elbows, [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10662.8s)]
*  or the shoulders rather. [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10664.22s)]
*  Benching can get rough, especially if you bench heavy. [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10665.619999999999s)]
*  Especially when you watch. [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10667.859999999999s)]
*  Have you ever seen the dudes snap a fucking? [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10668.699999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, I have seen that. [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10670.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10671.9s)]
*  That's all I was thinking about. [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10672.74s)]
*  It pops off and then you're fucked. [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10673.58s)]
*  You know Cody Rhodes? [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10675.9s)]
*  No. [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10677.06s)]
*  Cody Rhodes is the WWE champion. [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10677.9s)]
*  He's a Dusty Rhodes son. [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10680.14s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10681.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10682.619999999999s)]
*  I fucking tell him I'm doing the bench press competition [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10683.46s)]
*  and he goes, oh, I tore my pec at 315. [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10686.3s)]
*  And I was like, that's the fucking bet. [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10688.939999999999s)]
*  And he was like, oh, you don't even see it coming. [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10690.98s)]
*  Look at his pec. [[02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10692.84s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10693.84s)]
*  He goes, it felt like Velcro. [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10695.2s)]
*  He just started. [[02:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10696.76s)]
*  And he wrestled even though his pec was torn? [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10697.880000000001s)]
*  He wrestled with a torn pec. [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10699.960000000001s)]
*  What a fucking animal. [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10702.28s)]
*  He is a beast. [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10703.12s)]
*  Jesus Christ, that's crazy. [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10705.58s)]
*  Yeah, we did a Go Big Show together. [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10707.28s)]
*  His dad was the best. [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10709.44s)]
*  How about a cell with a torn pec? [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10711.44s)]
*  These guys are animals. [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10714.28s)]
*  Well, you know, it's when you're young. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10715.6s)]
*  Well, it's also like wrestling. [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10717.0s)]
*  It's like the culture, the pro wrestling culture. [[02:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10718.220000000001s)]
*  The culture is like, you're gonna get battered. [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10720.48s)]
*  Like we're battering each other. [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10722.08s)]
*  More so in the past. [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10723.8s)]
*  Those guys really got fucked up. [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10724.76s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10726.4s)]
*  You know, I've had a bunch of those guys in here. [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10727.68s)]
*  They tell me the stories. [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10729.44s)]
*  You know, Hulk Hogan and fucking Jake the Snake. [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10730.52s)]
*  Like all these, you guys are animals. [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10734.119999999999s)]
*  Undertaker, animal. [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10737.02s)]
*  And they all drank six packs after the show. [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10737.88s)]
*  Everyone was snorting coke. [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10740.6s)]
*  They were going from town to town, [[02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10741.8s)]
*  beating the fuck out of each other. [[02:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10743.64s)]
*  How much better do you think [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10745.119999999999s)]
*  anabolic steroids are than testosterone? [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10748.8s)]
*  As far as like putting weight on and mass, way better. [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10752.88s)]
*  Is it so much more noticeable? [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10755.279999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, it's completely changed. [[02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10756.56s)]
*  Have you ever done an anabolic steroid? [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10758.76s)]
*  Nothing serious. [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10759.96s)]
*  I've never done anything serious. [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10761.08s)]
*  I tried Anivar once and I've done like some minor stuff. [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10762.72s)]
*  There was some stuff that I got [[02:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10766.4s)]
*  that you used to be able to buy at the store. [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10767.6s)]
*  You used to be able to buy it from GNC, [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10769.92s)]
*  like a vitamin store. [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10772.64s)]
*  And they eventually pulled it off the market. [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10773.92s)]
*  I forget what it was called. [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10776.36s)]
*  I forget what it's called, but it was pills. [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10777.88s)]
*  And holy shit, did this work. [[02:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10779.42s)]
*  It was like legit steroids that you could buy at GNC. [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10781.720000000001s)]
*  When I was in college, you could buy GHB at GNC. [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10785.84s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10788.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because you would take a little capful [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10789.720000000001s)]
*  before you went to sleep [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10792.04s)]
*  and it would burn fat while you slept. [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10792.880000000001s)]
*  Well, apparently I was reading about this conspiracy [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10794.84s)]
*  about GHB and about how safe GHB is in small doses [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10798.68s)]
*  and how good it is for you with sleep and recovery. [[03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10803.4s)]
*  But the problem is people would dump it in people's drinks. [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10806.84s)]
*  And then it was like a date rape drug [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10809.84s)]
*  because if you have a lot of it, you're out of it. [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10812.0s)]
*  You don't know what the fuck is going on. [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10814.56s)]
*  And so then it became the date rape drug [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10816.16s)]
*  and then it just got pulled from the market [[03:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10817.92s)]
*  or at least very difficult to get. [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10819.48s)]
*  But yeah, I remember during those days when it was out, [[03:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10822.24s)]
*  bodybuilders would always talk about it. [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10826.92s)]
*  They were all taking GHB before they go to sleep. [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10828.519999999999s)]
*  And it has some, like Google what the conspiracy is [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10831.92s)]
*  about GHB, but it has some profound effects on recovery. [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10835.84s)]
*  Puts you in deep sleep. [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10839.0s)]
*  And apparently at the right doses, it's very safe. [[03:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10840.6s)]
*  Really? [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10844.2s)]
*  Yeah, this doctor is explaining [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10845.04s)]
*  what had led to it being demonized [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10847.0s)]
*  but what the actual benefits of GHB are. [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10850.44s)]
*  Yeah, I remember taking it in college. [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10854.48s)]
*  You took it? [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10857.0s)]
*  Well, to party. [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10857.84s)]
*  First time I ever took it was on a rock in Greece [[03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10860.68s)]
*  in the middle of the ocean, [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10863.52s)]
*  a rock in the middle of the ocean. [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10864.44s)]
*  You're the problem. [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10865.84s)]
*  People like you. [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10867.2s)]
*  It was funny, it was funny shit. [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10868.080000000002s)]
*  What'd it do for you? [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10870.0s)]
*  Guys like, hey Mike, want a little liquid ecstasy? [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10870.84s)]
*  And I was like, sure. [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10873.720000000001s)]
*  Liquid ecstasy? [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10875.28s)]
*  That's what he called it. [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10876.12s)]
*  And I found out later it was GHB. [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10877.0s)]
*  But he had like a little dropper capful. [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10879.2s)]
*  We all took a sip and all of a sudden [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10881.880000000001s)]
*  you start blowing up a little bit. [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10884.0s)]
*  Used to do that and there were like these other, [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10885.560000000001s)]
*  the store pills that you'd get. [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10888.240000000002s)]
*  You took enough of those, you'd fucking feel it. [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10889.92s)]
*  Do you remember they used to sell salvia? [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10891.640000000001s)]
*  They used to sell salvia in like a head shop [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10893.560000000001s)]
*  or they'd sell bongs. [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10897.48s)]
*  Salvia was like a super potent psychedelic. [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10899.0s)]
*  Oh, I still have nightmares of Ari's salvia trip. [[03:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10902.4s)]
*  Oh my God, we played it on the podcast for him [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10905.76s)]
*  and he explained it to us [[03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10907.6s)]
*  that he had a whole life under the sea. [[03:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10908.439999999999s)]
*  He had a whole relationship under the, [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10911.119999999999s)]
*  I think he went to another dimension. [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10912.48s)]
*  That's what I think. [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10914.88s)]
*  He said he was there for months. [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10916.039999999999s)]
*  Had a whole life. [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10917.48s)]
*  GHB's mechanism of action has not been elucidated. [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10919.52s)]
*  It crosses the blood brain barrier [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10923.119999999999s)]
*  where it interferes with dopamine levels [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10924.76s)]
*  in a complex dose dependent way. [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10926.56s)]
*  GHB's relief of the symptoms of narcolepsy [[03:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10928.64s)]
*  is believed to be mediated [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10931.64s)]
*  via these dopamigenic, [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10933.199999999999s)]
*  dopaminergic effects. [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10938.48s)]
*  GHB facilitates deep, slow wave sleep [[03:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10940.039999999999s)]
*  during which growth hormone release naturally increases. [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10943.72s)]
*  This may explain why higher levels of growth hormone [[03:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10946.96s)]
*  have been detected after GHB administration. [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10950.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's why the bodybuilders would take it. [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10952.84s)]
*  This is Derek from More Plates More Dates [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10958.2s)]
*  was on the podcast and he was explaining [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10960.64s)]
*  how making steroids illegal when they did that, [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10962.32s)]
*  they've stopped all the research and development [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10966.2s)]
*  that could have made those things very safe. [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10969.68s)]
*  So because they stopped doing any studies on them [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10972.72s)]
*  and they made them a banned substance, [[03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10976.68s)]
*  then everyone's just reliant upon the ones [[03:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10978.76s)]
*  that are already in existence [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10981.88s)]
*  and no new ones have been developed. [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10983.56s)]
*  So all the steroids that people are taking [[03:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10985.64s)]
*  are all steroids that have been developed [[03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10987.56s)]
*  a long, long time ago. [[03:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10988.96s)]
*  And he said it stifled the innovation [[03:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10990.64s)]
*  and the ability to make better, safer ones. [[03:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10993.16s)]
*  The problem is the idea of cheating in athletics, right? [[03:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10996.64s)]
*  And it is a real problem. [[03:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=10999.519999999999s)]
*  Someone is taking steroids, [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=11001.519999999999s)]
*  they have an advantage over people who don't take steroids. [[03:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=11002.759999999998s)]
*  But if they could figure out a way to make them safe [[03:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=11005.199999999999s)]
*  where they didn't completely fuck up your endocrine system, [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=11008.519999999999s)]
*  there should be an argument [[03:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=11011.12s)]
*  where if it makes you perform better [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=11012.84s)]
*  but doesn't have a detrimental effect on you, [[03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=11014.72s)]
*  then athletes should take it. [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=11017.44s)]
*  But people don't like that idea [[03:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=11019.24s)]
*  because they don't want someone [[03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=11020.84s)]
*  to have some massive advantage in any sort of a sport. [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=11022.44s)]
*  It also goes into society, [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=11026.16s)]
*  the demonizing of anyone on a semi-glutide. [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=11028.8s)]
*  People get shit on. [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=11033.24s)]
*  I joke that Tom's on Ozempic all the time. [[03:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=11035.92s)]
*  I think he is, but whatever. [[03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=11039.880000000001s)]
*  Do you think he is? [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=11041.56s)]
*  Oh, fuck yeah. [[03:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=11042.4s)]
*  Really? [[03:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=11043.22s)]
*  When have we ever known Tom to put in the hard work [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=11044.06s)]
*  to lose the weight? [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=11045.8s)]
*  But he's been really disciplined. [[03:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=11046.64s)]
*  Or is he going, anyway. [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=11048.08s)]
*  No, I'm joking. [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjaGb87pjMc&t=11049.76s)]
