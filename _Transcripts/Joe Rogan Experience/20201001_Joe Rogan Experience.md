# Joe Rogan Experience #1544 - Tim Dillon
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [October 01, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikJq6wcgrXI)
*  I'm here with the COVID kid.
*  COVID kid baby.
*  You're free.
*  You're free.
*  You're COVID free.
*  Antibodies are negative.
*  Are you worried?
*  You're traveling in some risky circumstances.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, a lot of these clubs that you work are, they're pretty full.
*  They're pretty full.
*  I've been looking at those lines outside your club.
*  I'm like, how big is this place?
*  Were you going to socially distance all these people?
*  It doesn't seem that socially distanced.
*  But I don't know.
*  But we also don't know.
*  Nobody, you know, is it airborne?
*  Can you get it?
*  Yes.
*  It is airborne.
*  100%.
*  Well, that's not great.
*  No, you definitely can get it from the air.
*  But here's the thing, man.
*  This is so politicized.
*  It's been so politicized.
*  If you look at the numbers of deaths, the numbers of deaths are way down.
*  They're talking about the numbers of like cases are up.
*  But the deaths are way down.
*  Yeah, they're much better at treating it.
*  Yeah, way better.
*  But also, it's like people are better at taking care of themselves.
*  They're going to go out and do things too.
*  They understand you got to take most people are aware of vitamin D now.
*  I take it every day.
*  Five thousand I use.
*  There you go.
*  A lot of you aware of zinc, a lot of you aware of vitamin C, and a lot of people are also
*  that are high risk.
*  They're not going.
*  Yeah.
*  Sometimes you look at people in the clubs, like I'll look at some members of my audience,
*  I'm like, you shouldn't be here.
*  Right.
*  You're taking way too big of a risk for a few ha ha's.
*  Yeah, but I'm happy about the ticket and thanks for coming.
*  But I'm like just looking at them going, I wouldn't be in that chair if I were you.
*  But you got to make your own decision.
*  Maybe you have to.
*  I would.
*  I think if I was locked up for six months and I couldn't go out and then one of my favorite
*  comics is in town.
*  I'm like, fuck, let's go out.
*  Let's go out.
*  Let's go do it.
*  Well, you get to the point.
*  Mike, you coming?
*  Yeah, well, you got to be.
*  You obviously want to avoid getting it, but there's a level of fatalism where you have
*  to say, listen, you know, there's no guarantee you could walk out of your house and encounter
*  any number of things that could kill you.
*  Well, Florida just said, fuck it.
*  They just fuck it.
*  We're opening up.
*  Full capacity.
*  Everything.
*  Concerts.
*  Everything.
*  You could do like arenas.
*  They weren't even closed down for that long.
*  They closed down for a few weeks.
*  Long enough.
*  Yeah.
*  They were like, that's enough.
*  Everyone sobered up.
*  That was just a hangover.
*  Everybody got sober in Florida.
*  They sobered up and went, let's get back at it.
*  Disney World's been open forever.
*  Disneyland in L.A. is still closed.
*  They're about to go bankrupt.
*  Yeah.
*  Disney World.
*  They're like, come on in, wear a mask.
*  I don't give a fuck.
*  Yeah, who cares?
*  They don't care.
*  Yeah, just come in.
*  Be careful.
*  Don't get eaten by an alligator.
*  Yeah.
*  You might get eaten by an alligator or you might get a cough.
*  Right.
*  Or you might get a cold.
*  Yeah.
*  It seems like we're trending in the direction of things opening up.
*  Listen, you got to give people freedom.
*  The government was never supposed to have the ability to tell you what you can and can't
*  do in terms of what's risky.
*  The argument against that is that you're putting other people in danger.
*  At this point in time, we're six months into this fucking thing.
*  You got to peel the band-aid off.
*  You got to do something.
*  You can't just allow people to go bankrupt and never be able to work.
*  It's also like Thomas Sowell, the economist, said, one of my favorite quotes, he goes,
*  There's no solutions.
*  There's only trade-offs.
*  It's a trade-off.
*  If you tell everyone, yes, you might keep some people healthy, but at what level of
*  damage to the economy, to people's livelihoods, suicide is up, child abuse is up.
*  There's all kinds of problems that come from a lockdown.
*  It's way up.
*  Suicide's way up.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Suicide, child abuse.
*  That shocked me that child abuse was up because I was like, who?
*  I thought child abuse was like a fixed thing, meaning if you hit your kids, you just hit
*  your kids.
*  I think people react to heavy stress.
*  How many people are just broke and don't know what to do and their kids won't shut the fuck
*  up?
*  They just got a smack.
*  Yeah.
*  It's terrible.
*  It's very sad.
*  It's the saddest fucking time ever because people are losing their jobs and they're losing
*  their livelihoods and they didn't do anything wrong.
*  Right.
*  It's the only time.
*  Nobody's addressing that.
*  Right.
*  Nobody's addressing that.
*  Then there's a lot of people, celebrities and people that have a lot of money that are
*  shaming people who want to go back to work.
*  They're saying that these people just want to go out and party and have fun.
*  It's like, no, they need to earn money.
*  That's shaming people that want to do shows.
*  I've seen that.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  It's crazy.
*  They're fools.
*  They're people with money.
*  Listen, people can do almost anything that puts them at risk and freely.
*  You can BMX bike.
*  You can fucking bungee jump.
*  You could go sail.
*  You could eat anything you want.
*  Yeah, you could sail in the ocean.
*  You could fucking, you could hand glide.
*  You could do all these different things that are super dangerous.
*  You could eat anything you want.
*  You could go get drunk all the time, kill your liver.
*  The idea that this shouldn't be something that you should be able to try or do because
*  you're going to put other people at risk, boy, that gets real sketchy.
*  That gets real sketchy because the people that are at risk, they know they're at risk.
*  It's not like you're sneaking up on them.
*  It's one thing if you have a kid, this is where it gets dangerous.
*  If you have a 21 year old kid who parties all the time and then you're 60 and your kid
*  comes home and he gives it to you and you die, that's real.
*  That's real.
*  If you live with your fucking parents or you live with your grandparents, yeah, don't do
*  anything high risk, you fucking asshole.
*  But if you're a regular person who lives by themselves or lives with some friends and
*  you want to be able to go out and you're willing to take the risk, you should be able to.
*  People need to make money.
*  Well, the government's not supposed to be able to have that kind of power over you.
*  And once they have it, it's very difficult for them to let it go.
*  Yeah, well, we saw it after 9-11, right?
*  After 9-11, the government took a lot of power, supposedly for very good virtuous reasons of
*  keeping America safe and protecting everybody.
*  And a lot of those powers, they never let them go.
*  Are we going to go right into conspiracies?
*  They never gave them back.
*  No, I just thought it was a nice segue.
*  Do you have your QT shirt?
*  I just thought it was a nice segue.
*  That's all.
*  I just thought we could bring up 9-11 really quick.
*  We could go just a nice route to the underground military bases.
*  But I mean, it's true.
*  They have a lot of power and they don't give it back.
*  And none of the powers they get, they don't give them back.
*  They don't go, oh, the disease is over.
*  Now we're going to set the contact tracing.
*  It sounds great, right?
*  If somebody, oh, it doesn't even sound great.
*  But the idea of it is like if you're in contact with people, they trace who you were in contact
*  with because of COVID.
*  They're going to do that for other reasons and you're not going to like it.
*  They're going to use that technology to trace people that are considered antisocial
*  personality disorder or whatever it is.
*  They don't like what you posted on Facebook.
*  They don't like, I mean, that's coming.
*  But what if you get injured?
*  What if you hurt your back and they know that they put you on pills?
*  And then they say, hey, you driving, Tim?
*  What's going on?
*  Tim, you're driving?
*  Your back's hurt and you're on the pills.
*  Are you driving on pills?
*  Or whatever the fuck it is.
*  If there's someone, look, Snowden talked about how people could just read your emails, right?
*  Well, what's to stop someone from tracing you?
*  You have some political disagreement with some guy who's in office, but you also cheat
*  on your wife.
*  And they go, look, Tim's going over to this fucking lady's house and slipping out of the
*  old fucking schlozl.
*  Right.
*  It's a huge problem.
*  It's a problem.
*  That nobody, like we've all resigned ourselves to the fact that it's happening and we just
*  go, huh, you just shrug.
*  Well, we're busy.
*  That's how we feel about a lot of things.
*  It's true.
*  There's too much to think about.
*  It's how it is with the NSA, the mass surveillance.
*  People just sort of go, what are you going to do?
*  What are you going to do?
*  Most people are like, my favorite, and I've said it too, it's like, they're like, if you
*  want to surveil me, doing nothing.
*  That's everybody's like, hey, surveil me.
*  I get it.
*  I've said, I've made jokes like that.
*  When you look at tech and how much power the tech has acquired over the last five years,
*  for example.
*  Have you watched The Social Dilemma?
*  I did.
*  Holy fuck.
*  I thought a lot of that was pretty well known before it though, right?
*  It's well known to you.
*  But I think for people who don't really pay attention to it.
*  See, here's the difference between you and I and the regular folks.
*  People have a real job.
*  Say if you work for Microsoft, your fucking job all day is thinking about Microsoft.
*  You have real important shit.
*  You have bottom lines.
*  You have to bump up.
*  You have goals to meet.
*  You have meetings.
*  You have to get together.
*  They have things to think of.
*  We're just fucking off all day.
*  Yeah.
*  No, that is a good point.
*  Part of our job is to kind of fuck off.
*  Part of our job is to figure out what's funny out there.
*  You can't do that by really focusing on one thing.
*  You have to just go all over the place.
*  But I think The Social Dilemma, when I watched it, I was like, yeah, the thing with social
*  media is it's not designed to work well.
*  It's designed to work how it's working.
*  That was maybe the biggest thing about social dilemmas.
*  This is designed to work this way.
*  You should be fighting.
*  The negativity spreads very quickly.
*  People are going to go at each other's throats.
*  You're fighting with family.
*  I watch family members fight each other that don't even talk in real life.
*  They wouldn't even know each other existed.
*  They fight on Facebook.
*  They find each other and fight.
*  They would never see each other.
*  They would maybe do it once at a reunion every three years.
*  But what's the answer?
*  Is the answer to just log off?
*  That seems to be the only answer.
*  Logging off is not the worst idea.
*  I was in the woods recently.
*  I was in Utah hunting and no service for three days and it was great.
*  Do you feel a high?
*  People say you feel a high the day, like a day of no phone.
*  They say you feel like you get up the next day.
*  You're noticing birds.
*  You notice things.
*  You feel better.
*  Yeah.
*  If you can't check your phone all the time because it doesn't work, you don't check your
*  phone.
*  Yeah.
*  What, are you going to look at your pictures over and over again?
*  You're not.
*  That's what you want to check likes or comments.
*  That's what dopamine hit.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't read comments and I don't check likes and I don't check.
*  I have a very strict policy and it's made me very happy.
*  But even that, even that, I watch, I look at other people's shit.
*  So I would go to look at your page.
*  I would laugh at your stuff.
*  Okay.
*  And I'd go read your comments.
*  I'd go, this guy's a piece of shit.
*  I would read assholes being mean.
*  Even though it's not about me, it has nothing to do with me.
*  I would still occasionally run to things that bothered me or run into behavior that annoyed
*  me.
*  And then like, why am I focusing on some person that doesn't even have a real name?
*  Their name is like, you know, fucking A plus Y.
*  I stopped the comments when one of them was said that we think Whitney Cummings is Tim
*  Dillon's CIA handler.
*  I said, I'm going to check out now.
*  Like this is, yeah, they were like, he's not talking about Obamagate on his show.
*  It's because Whitney Cummings is telling him not to.
*  Like Whitney Cummings, I love her to death.
*  I don't think she knows what Obamagate is.
*  And I have mentioned it a few times.
*  It was like, but it was just so funny.
*  I started laughing, but I'm like, I, cause it's people's mental illness.
*  Like you're just living in people's very dysfunctional minds.
*  Well, there's people I know that I know, not good friends, but I know pretty casually that
*  will tell me that they think the CIA talks to me about who I can have on the show.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Because I've had Mike Baker on who used to be in the CIA.
*  He's still in.
*  Most likely.
*  I even joked with him about it.
*  But my interaction with him is about what we talk about on the podcast.
*  And then afterwards we talk about like fishing and his kids.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  It doesn't bring you into a room and threaten you.
*  There's no, there's none of that.
*  The CIA doesn't have a podcasting division.
*  Like they're not like who's on Marin this week.
*  That's not what they're, they're not booking podcasts.
*  I bet they do now.
*  That's interesting.
*  They might.
*  I bet they do now.
*  I bet they didn't before we came around.
*  But now they might.
*  I would imagine and understand.
*  They're big in movies.
*  Yeah.
*  They're big in movies.
*  That's huge.
*  Like movies, especially movies that are made about, you know, Zero Dark Thirty, things like
*  that about the torture, Catherine Bigelow.
*  Like they try to justify their policies through popular culture all the time.
*  Oh yeah.
*  It's propaganda.
*  Yeah.
*  But I just think it's hilarious the idea that they have to now check who's on a podcast.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know if it's the CIA.
*  I mean, I don't know who's doing that, but it's someone in government most certainly
*  has relationships with Hollywood.
*  And also, like the people in Hollywood, if the CIA calls you up and you're doing a movie
*  like Zero Dark Thirty, and they go, we'd like to talk to you about this.
*  Like, fuck yeah, we're going to talk to the CIA.
*  We're going to talk to the SEALs.
*  We're going to talk to the NSA.
*  Yeah.
*  You want to know.
*  Yeah, you want to know.
*  But then they can also feed you whatever information they want.
*  For sure.
*  There's that.
*  For sure that's happened.
*  For sure there's been propaganda that's been spilled through Hollywood.
*  There's no doubt about it.
*  I just think they missed the boat on this podcast thing.
*  They didn't know it was coming.
*  They should have gotten involved.
*  They should have gotten involved.
*  They need to have a few undercover CIA agents doing a podcast out of their Brooklyn apartment.
*  The thing is it wouldn't be good.
*  And making millions.
*  No, you have to have mental illness.
*  You have to be a little sick.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, when I think of how many hours I've talked for, how many hours you've talked for,
*  there's something wrong.
*  Something wrong.
*  Something very wrong.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Then people need to realize that.
*  Like, if you take my opinion seriously, like listen to me, I don't even take my opinion
*  seriously.
*  Why would you listen to me for half the time I'm just thinking out loud.
*  Right.
*  Like literally maybe 40% of the things that I say on this podcast, I don't know what I'm
*  saying when I'm saying it.
*  Right.
*  I'm just thinking out loud.
*  Right.
*  And that's the whole art form of doing this because you can't, you have to explore every
*  possibility.
*  Yeah.
*  And sometimes I have a thought that's very well thought out.
*  Sometimes where it's like, no, I've thought about this for a while and this is why I believe
*  this.
*  Yeah.
*  And there's a difference.
*  Like you'll hear things that I say that are like really clear.
*  I know what I'm saying.
*  Right.
*  And then you hear like rambling nonsense too.
*  Right.
*  And you got to, that's just how it goes.
*  Yeah.
*  If you think out loud, you're going to have both of those things.
*  Why do you think people get so angry at the idea of that?
*  Like people get very angry at the idea of like being, just being open to the idea of
*  being wrong.
*  Like people get angry and they're like every word out of your mouth has to be absolutely
*  the what you want it to be.
*  It's weird to me.
*  Because we're in a gotcha soundbite culture.
*  Right.
*  So one of the ways they'll digest your show or my show is someone will put a clip up,
*  and they'll look with this piece of shit Tim Dillon said, and it'll have something that
*  you said completely out of context in a two and a half hour rant.
*  Right.
*  Where you're just like talking nonsense about JFK still being alive.
*  Right.
*  Or whatever it is.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I end my live show every, every, every show I've been doing right now by saying,
*  thanks for having me everybody.
*  Ruth Bader Ginsburg is burning in hell.
*  And that's, and it's, that's fun because to me, I'm like, you know, all I've seen is praise
*  lavished upon her and deservedly so.
*  Right.
*  But the funny angle to me is that she's actually burning in hell and good night.
*  And that's what, but if you take that and you, and you, you know, you don't understand
*  that that's a funny thing to say.
*  Yes.
*  And that there is no hell probably.
*  And I don't know who's there, but that's the funny angle to say.
*  Of course.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's one of the things that Louis CK said when he was talking about comedy material
*  and, you know, getting in trouble for material.
*  He's like, comedy is often saying things that you're not supposed to say.
*  Right.
*  Like that's why you say it.
*  Cause everyone knows you're not supposed to say it.
*  And then you go and say it and like, oh my God.
*  And that's what's funny.
*  Yes.
*  The idea that you're holding people to those thoughts as if this is like an affidavit and
*  they've signed this and they've worked it out with lawyers and this is my position.
*  And this is, this is where I stand.
*  You're literally talking off the cuff saying something preposterous like Ruth Bader Ginsburg
*  is burning in hell right now.
*  Right.
*  And you're doing that just so everybody else goes, it gets a big, everyone goes, ah, because
*  it's crazy.
*  It's entertaining.
*  It's crazy.
*  And maybe true.
*  Well, but what is crazy about it is that it's, you know, it's the unexpected.
*  It's the, it's the crazy, just out there say the most insane thing you can.
*  Well, the thing about it today though is everyone is looking to catch people saying things you
*  shouldn't say and getting mad at you.
*  And then they want to silence you.
*  Right.
*  They want to stop you from saying the things that you, you shouldn't be saying.
*  You know, to me, it's like a lot of this is the death of curiosity, right?
*  Cause I, I grew up and I listened to all these different radio shows.
*  I would listen to AM talk radio guys like Bob Grant and Rush Limbaugh.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I remember Bob Grant.
*  He used to go, get off my phone.
*  You fake phony fraud.
*  And he would just hang up on people.
*  He would fight with people.
*  Guys would call him.
*  It was always like the same guy who was like, Bob, this is Tony from Seaside Heights.
*  And he would go and he'd go, you know, I think you're, you know, the Clintons, I think you'd
*  be a little lighter.
*  And Bob would go, will you shut up?
*  And they would just fight all day.
*  And I didn't know if the guy was right or if he was wrong.
*  I just knew what was happening was hilarious and interesting.
*  And I was curious about what other people in the world, I was a young kid being driven
*  around by my parents, but I'm like, I was curious about what other people in the world
*  thought, what they were saying.
*  Because when you listen to those talk radio shows, you're in a car, you're driving around
*  and you hear some psychopath on that's calling Bob Grant like they used to say to Bob Grant.
*  They'll be like, you know, you really disappointed me.
*  And Bob Grant would go, do you know me?
*  Do you have any knowledge of who I am?
*  Like I disappointed you.
*  And then you would try to look at the cars and be like, I wonder what psychopath went
*  home and called the guy, you know?
*  So I was just curious.
*  Now it seems like there's this death of curiosity where no one is curious about what anyone
*  else is thinking unless it happens to be what they're thinking.
*  It has to coincide exactly with how you view the world.
*  So uninteresting.
*  It's part of it is social media and part of it is Trump.
*  Trump has his brand of being president, his way of doing it has polarized people so hard
*  that they will do anything and everything they can to keep him from being president
*  again, from being president a second term.
*  And they're forcing compliance.
*  You have to comply with our view of what's going on in the world.
*  And I think I find it fascinating just going through my Instagram feed and looking at people
*  who are Trump supporters and Trump haters and looking at their perspectives and looking
*  at this this fucking giant Grand Canyon like divide.
*  And my favorite thing is vote.
*  Tell everyone to vote.
*  That's what everyone does now.
*  It's telling me.
*  I did a whole podcast episode this week.
*  I go, I'm not telling you to vote.
*  It's not my job.
*  Vote or don't vote.
*  I don't tell you to eat your vegetables.
*  I don't tell you to jog.
*  I'll tell you to do anything.
*  I'm not telling you have to meditate.
*  Hey, raise your kids.
*  You spend time with your kids.
*  You spending time with your son.
*  He's in college.
*  You and him don't talk like what in God's name?
*  Like you walk into a nightclub to see me.
*  I say, Ruth, Bernie, he's burning it out.
*  Then I turn around and go, everyone, make sure to have a voting plan.
*  Well, what's happened is there's a lot of these fucking idiots that aren't getting any
*  attention.
*  And we've found out why they're in show business.
*  They're not just in show business to create.
*  They're not just in show business to hone their craft and to be good as an actor or
*  be good as a comic.
*  They want attention.
*  And when there's no attention to be had on stage, they seek it out on Twitter.
*  And they seek it out by being correct about things.
*  Some people are using Twitter and they're just hilarious.
*  They're just saying ridiculous shit.
*  Very funny.
*  The same thing with Instagram.
*  Like Lil Duval is my favorite.
*  Yeah, he's great.
*  Never gets political.
*  Never gets serious.
*  Everything's just having a good time.
*  Occasionally talking about pussy.
*  That's mostly what he does.
*  But some people, they lack that self-awareness and all they want is likes.
*  Right?
*  So they try to figure out what can I say to get people thinking that I'm really
*  progressive and really open-minded and what can I say that really hits the tone
*  and gets a lot of juicy likes?
*  Yeah.
*  I'd like to hit about 2,000 likes with this one.
*  It's so weird because to me, social media is so fun because the people that are
*  really the best at it are 15.
*  They're the winners.
*  Like the TikTok kids are the winners.
*  The Damilio girls have like 80 million.
*  They're making money.
*  They're making real money.
*  Like millions of dollars.
*  More than their parents.
*  Yeah.
*  My fucking 12-year-old walks around the house all day.
*  So what are we all even trying to...
*  Your take is not half of them going like this.
*  So what are we doing?
*  Your numbers are not...
*  So I look at it, it's like it's a joke.
*  Social media should be a joke because it is a joke.
*  Because the people that are really monetizing it, like a lot of those people,
*  they're 16-year-olds and they're dancing around and it's like...
*  And it's unserious.
*  It's a silly thing.
*  The accumulation of time during the day, right?
*  If you look at people's phones, I'd love to grab a listen to Milano's phone and go,
*  eight hours!
*  Right.
*  Eight hours you're on your phone?
*  Eight hours?
*  How many of these people are interacting with other human beings for eight hours a day?
*  Not...
*  Yeah.
*  Not...
*  Very few.
*  Very few.
*  And certainly not having meaningful conversations and long...
*  What they're doing is they're seeking approval through others online and it's very
*  fake, hollow, shallow way and that's what Twitter is.
*  It's arguing with people and it can't...
*  But some people use it well.
*  There's journalists that use it well.
*  There's people that find interesting things to discuss and some people pull it off.
*  But it's not many.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm wondering if the answer is just abstinence because I don't think people can handle this, right?
*  That's what Ari found out.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that you might have to just disconnect.
*  And I wonder if subsequent generations will.
*  Like they'll just go...
*  Yeah.
*  We saw what happened in 2020 and this stuff almost led to a civil war and craziness.
*  We don't want any part of it.
*  Too many people like it.
*  Too many people like it for everybody to jump off.
*  But I think enough people can understand because of documentaries like the social dilemma and
*  conversations that they have with each other about it where they're going to check out.
*  And what is that?
*  The light phone?
*  Is that what it's called?
*  The one that it's like...
*  It's a black and white phone.
*  All you can do is text and make phone calls off of it.
*  It's like a small...
*  Yeah.
*  So it doesn't give you the like the vivid imagery of an iPhone.
*  Can't watch YouTube videos on it.
*  Just call 911.
*  But if you want to text me, you can text me.
*  And if you want to call me, you can call me.
*  And that's all it does.
*  So no data.
*  Is that what it's called?
*  The light phone?
*  Yeah.
*  Look at this thing.
*  See, this is for people that realize they're junkies and they're like, oh, I'm a junkie.
*  What it...
*  It's kind of...
*  It's a little embarrassing now that you got, I can't control myself.
*  I need a light phone.
*  It is and it isn't though, man, because there's something to be said for this.
*  There's something really good to be said for this.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a phone, an alarm.
*  Oh, you can play music on it.
*  You can get a taxi.
*  Taxi?
*  Where do you live?
*  You know, soon, soon, soon, soon, soon, light phones going to sneak in a messaging feature.
*  Like light phones going to start to creep in.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  I'm amazed that it has music on it, though.
*  I am shocked by that.
*  The light phone can call, text or set alarms out of the box.
*  What's up, Jimmy?
*  You might be right.
*  There's some parent will buy this for the kid, be like, you can have a phone, but all you can have is a light phone.
*  And then kids will hack it.
*  Oh, man.
*  It's coming.
*  Yeah, it's coming.
*  There should be, by the way, they should have like a fight phone where the only thing on it is Twitter.
*  You can't call anyone.
*  You can't text.
*  Just have a fight phone.
*  It's just Twitter and Facebook.
*  And you can't call 911 if you get hit by a car.
*  Optional tech available includes calculator, a simple music player and a podcast too.
*  Well, you fucked up there.
*  Big problem.
*  Here's an animation of some of the interfaces or future tools that are still in development.
*  Not all these tools are yet available.
*  You know, I know friends who have taken Twitter and Instagram and may like Sam Harris deleted Instagram off his phone a long time ago.
*  He told me he goes, I'm infinitely happier without it on my phone because he would get in arguments with people on Instagram.
*  I know. Excuse me.
*  Twitter, Twitter.
*  And I would text him.
*  I'd be like, what the fuck are you doing, man?
*  You're a neuroscientist.
*  You're brilliant. Why are you fighting with people?
*  Why are you fighting with these idiots?
*  But it's like you get wrapped up and people like saying disparaging things about you.
*  You're being defamed.
*  And you're like, I should read it.
*  You have to read it.
*  Keep moving.
*  You're big.
*  You're big with that.
*  Like you don't get into the fray when people say nonsense about you.
*  There's too many people saying nonsense about me.
*  I spend my whole day doing that.
*  Because it would take hours and hours.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's how you wind up not being productive.
*  You want to be successful.
*  You want to get things done.
*  You can argue with people about who you are.
*  Do you know who you are?
*  If you know who you are, you can't argue with people about who you are.
*  Right.
*  Makes sense.
*  People want to bring up mistakes you've made 10 years ago or 5 years ago.
*  Like, okay, great.
*  Good luck with that.
*  Try to diminish me.
*  It's a silly way to treat people.
*  I wouldn't do it to other people.
*  I don't want them to do it to me.
*  But I don't want to argue with you either.
*  If you want to talk in person and people want to talk in person,
*  that's how people work things out.
*  And most of the time when you do that, you wind up hugging or laughing.
*  It's fine.
*  Most people are cool.
*  It's a shit way to communicate.
*  It's bad.
*  I'll see people that are fighting on Facebook and I'm like,
*  I know you have each other's numbers.
*  Right.
*  And also, fuck the number.
*  If you saw each other in person, I guarantee you just talk.
*  Right.
*  Nine times out of 10.
*  Right.
*  You would just talk.
*  You would just be like, well, I think he's this and that.
*  Well, maybe.
*  I mean, I don't know.
*  Like, you'd work it out.
*  Right.
*  It's not that wall there that's between you on social media.
*  It's also like when someone's writing something and you can't,
*  you're not there in front of them.
*  They're just writing it and then you have to read it.
*  And then you write something back.
*  It's like we have an amazing way to communicate.
*  It involves looking at each other.
*  It involves being near each other.
*  It involves registering when you say something mean and it bothers a person.
*  Right.
*  All that stuff's out the window when you're just texting or when you're tweeting.
*  Tweeting is even worse, right?
*  Because then the whole world's seeing it and you know that someone's saying
*  something mean about you and other people are reading it.
*  This must be real.
*  Other people can read it.
*  It's a terrible way to communicate.
*  It's the worst.
*  It's probably the worst way in history we've ever had to have a productive conversation.
*  And there are so many people that are mentally ill because of it.
*  Yeah.
*  Mentally ill.
*  Do you think it exacerbated something?
*  100%.
*  Yeah.
*  100%.
*  And a lot of them are these fucking actors and actresses.
*  Yeah.
*  That are just, they're not getting any attention.
*  It's narcissism run wild and there's no puncturing it with any type of objective
*  reality or facts.
*  They're creating their own world to live in.
*  Does this get worse though?
*  I think it kind of gets worse.
*  I think it heads to a kind of dystopian place where everybody lives in their own reality.
*  We're seeing that right now and it just seems to be inevitable to a degree.
*  The real fear is that it's going to get more immersive.
*  The real fear is that the solution will be even worse than this.
*  And it's going to be like in your head, shit in the head.
*  Yeah.
*  Some neural link type shit that the next level of this interaction,
*  the next level of technology is going to be way more immersive.
*  That's what I'm worried about.
*  I'm worried it's not going to be something you escape from.
*  You just leave your phone there.
*  If that phone goes into your body, you're not escaping.
*  Yeah. You just hit the switch, Tim.
*  Just hit the switch.
*  Don't turn it on when you pee.
*  And you're in.
*  Don't check your messages while you're peeing.
*  Right.
*  Just let me see how people feel about this.
*  Everyone's mad.
*  Everyone hates me.
*  Oh, the Meghan McCain routine.
*  Yeah.
*  Woo.
*  I got to be honest with you.
*  It sounds so convenient, the chip already, because I lose my phone a lot.
*  So I'm like already, I could just get a chip and then just kind of click it on.
*  Just get the chip.
*  What are you worried about?
*  You're a strong man.
*  Yeah, you can handle it.
*  What are your words?
*  Sticks and stones can hurt your bones.
*  I know.
*  Maybe we should all embrace it.
*  Maybe we should just go that route.
*  Maybe there is no fight anymore.
*  Maybe we should just, maybe we're not spending enough time on Twitter.
*  Right.
*  Just be a cunt 24 hours a day.
*  Just lay in a spot and tweet.
*  Go to war.
*  Just go to war.
*  Just fire off tweets all day, every day.
*  Fight with people you don't know.
*  Just quote people and go, bad take.
*  Nope.
*  I love that.
*  You just quote tweet and go, nope, fuck off.
*  Bad take.
*  Be better.
*  Ah, be better is my favorite.
*  Be better.
*  Just keep going.
*  Just all the passive aggressive shit that you could say possibly.
*  You almost wonder, do you just jump in hard?
*  And then you have Facebook, which is to me the funniest one, because it is truly a graveyard.
*  It's elderly people screaming out into the void, into nothingness.
*  Writing long, multiple paragraph posts.
*  It's purgatory for people that are on their deathbed.
*  They're in the latter years of their life.
*  Their dog just died.
*  They've got a picture of their dead dog on Facebook.
*  They're saying, Max took his last nap.
*  And then they're writing three paragraphs about Kamala Harris.
*  It's like, this is crazy.
*  And then other people are fighting with them.
*  And it's really sick.
*  But I like it.
*  I enjoy it.
*  I do a thread sometimes.
*  Instead of a Netflix movie, sometimes I'll just do a 300 comment thread.
*  And just, yeah, just read it.
*  I'll just read it.
*  I'll just go, wow, interesting.
*  Some people are surprisingly smart.
*  Some people are so out there.
*  Some people that used to sell me cocaine are now big into family values.
*  So I love that.
*  A lot of my ex-coke dealers are now Q people.
*  So they're like, save the children.
*  I'm like, you didn't raise your children.
*  You sold me cocaine.
*  I was a child.
*  I was doing it when I was in my teens.
*  And now you're like, we need to save the children in the tunnels.
*  I'm like, what?
*  So it's fun to track the progression of people through those sites.
*  There's enough real child trafficking where those people get
*  like positive reinforcement of their ideas.
*  Of course.
*  We were talking about it recently, Jamie, those 35 people that were saved in Georgia.
*  Some were also saved in Ohio.
*  Yeah.
*  As long as they are, they're also right.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the thing about the Q people.
*  As long as they are, they're also right in certain instances.
*  There's human trafficking is a massive problem.
*  It's a real problem.
*  There have been massive cover-ups with our government and many other governments.
*  Do you know that right now?
*  And we're in the midst of one right now.
*  Today, there's more slavery today than when we had slavery in the United States.
*  25 missing and endangered kids rescued in Ohio over two weeks.
*  U.S. Marshals located dozens of missing children between the ages of 13 and 18
*  in a mission called Operation Safety Net.
*  The children found in Cleveland, East Cleveland, Akron, Mansfield, Euclid, Willoughby,
*  and even Miami, Florida.
*  Wow.
*  So right there, it's an operation.
*  That's a trafficking operation.
*  It's real.
*  Yeah, that is real.
*  And it's particularly real when you can get kids that are orphans.
*  Fall through the cracks.
*  Foster kids.
*  Yeah, and the government, I mean, this is what nobody really wants to admit.
*  That the United States government at all levels has in many ways been either a kind of,
*  I won't say a sponsor of this on the whole, but there's elements of the CIA that have allowed
*  things like this to happen in order to get information on people.
*  Well, that was the idea about the Epstein thing.
*  Absolutely it was.
*  Was that they let him do that.
*  Correct.
*  They would have something over these people.
*  And that is sick beyond human comprehension.
*  And most people don't want to really admit that's happening.
*  Right.
*  And when I think, like a lot of the cute people found that stuff out, then their brains melted.
*  And they were like, oh, but David Spade's eating kids.
*  It's like, that's not it.
*  That's not where it goes.
*  What it is, is that you have a lot of people that are getting educated overnight.
*  And their minds cannot handle the amount of information, much of it very disturbing.
*  Remember last week when you asked that that was the first time that that happened,
*  the Epstein style story.
*  And I mentioned that.
*  Which Epstein style story?
*  Just like that.
*  I think you said something like this has never happened before with senators.
*  Oh, that's right.
*  And then you found that other story.
*  He's the one I learned about it from.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, no, this happened before it happened in Omaha, Nebraska.
*  It was called the Franklin scandal.
*  A lot of people know about it.
*  A guy named Nick Bryant wrote a book about it.
*  And there was an interstate pedophile network that was trafficking kids to wealthy and powerful
*  people, many of them in the government.
*  I mean, there's a market, there's money here.
*  But this was the one.
*  That's separate from North Fox Island because-
*  North Fox Island also.
*  I mean, there's many, many.
*  He knows a lot of them.
*  There's many, I had some guys on the podcast that blew my mind.
*  I had no idea.
*  And I was a conspiracy guy and I had no idea that this was going on.
*  But a lot of it is blackmail.
*  And a lot of it is people allowing the worst things imaginable to happen to children in
*  order to gain leverage on other people.
*  That's what was happening with Epstein.
*  That's what was happening with Franklin.
*  But it's also people that have that hunger.
*  They have this appetite for sick shit.
*  Of course.
*  They're sick, sadistic pedophiles.
*  And then some group of people call it an intelligence agency or whoever.
*  Whoever wants leverage, whoever wants power is using this as a means to obtain it.
*  So even though the Q people are saying, because they're saying like, well, everyone in Hollywood
*  has been executed and other clones.
*  I mean, it's like, it's kind of funny.
*  It's kind of funny a little bit.
*  They're really, JFK juniors alive.
*  There's some real wild stuff.
*  But the core premise, which is that human trafficking is a horrible, insidious thing
*  that is connected to many high powered people, isn't necessarily wrong.
*  No, it's not.
*  It's not wrong.
*  And there's a lot of evidence throughout history.
*  That's why that Pizzagate shit turned out to be nonsense.
*  But they're creepy.
*  And that art is creepy.
*  What's not just that the art is creepy.
*  Yeah.
*  It's that the, the, do you remember Breitbart wrote a tweet about.
*  John Podesta.
*  And he said is something to the degree of when will it come out that John Podesta is
*  like protecting, you know, sexual predators or something like that.
*  I forget the tweet.
*  Jamie could find it.
*  But it was along the lines of that.
*  It was almost like that he was helping them.
*  Enabling.
*  Correct.
*  Enabling.
*  Yes.
*  And I forget.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, there have been people like that in high levels of government and in leadership.
*  There it is.
*  How prog grew John Podesta is in household name is world-class underage sex slave op
*  cover-upper defending unspeakable dregs escapes me now.
*  2011, February 4th.
*  He died shortly after that.
*  Yeah.
*  He didn't die long after that.
*  Not long.
*  But he also was unhealthy and crazy.
*  He was kind of crazy too, right?
*  I don't know much about him, but I'm sure he was a little wild.
*  To get into that business, you have to be, right?
*  I would imagine.
*  He was a guy that did a lot of stunts.
*  He was very incendiary.
*  He made a name for himself and made a name for his company.
*  That's the problem with those guys is whenever someone goes way out of their way to do stunts
*  and to do things, it's like, ugh.
*  And then something else, if you're involved in something and then it's legitimate,
*  now I have to go.
*  Right.
*  What is it?
*  The guy, what the fuck is his name?
*  That guy that's always doing the undercover shit.
*  James O'Keefe.
*  James O'Keefe.
*  He's got a new one now about Ilhan Omar.
*  The ballots in the car.
*  The ballots in the car.
*  And he's got these guys saying, look at all these ballots.
*  Look at all these ballots.
*  But you got to go with that guy.
*  You got to go, okay.
*  But didn't he, there was some shit with Roy Moore where they were trying to get girls
*  to say that he knocked them up.
*  There was a lot of sting shit.
*  It's like anybody that you know he's coming to this with an agenda.
*  Like a strong agenda.
*  But then he also catches shit that's real.
*  He caught those people on Twitter, the Twitter executives talking about how they shadow ban
*  people, talking about how they ban conservatives or how they block conservatives.
*  That's all real.
*  Absolutely.
*  Whenever someone can't be straight with you and they have little tricks and they have
*  stunts.
*  Whenever that, you go.
*  I think the argument that those guys make is that to get any attention in the climate
*  that we're in, it's almost impossible to do it with a sober, reasoned, rational approach.
*  You have to, because it's the circus.
*  They're competing with Trump.
*  They're competing with anybody.
*  They're competing for oxygen with some of the most entertaining president in history.
*  By far.
*  By far, right?
*  Anything you do now has to be on that level of spectacle to get any type of attention.
*  You look at the intellectuals, whether they were left-wing or right-wing from 30 or 40
*  years ago, they're appalled at the people now who are carrying their message.
*  But the people now who are carrying their message are like, we're existing in the climate
*  that we're in now.
*  What is the general consensus?
*  How is the media treating this Ilhan Omar thing?
*  Am I saying her name right?
*  I mean, look at me.
*  Do you think I know how to pronounce?
*  Do you think you know her better than me?
*  Ilhan Omar's name?
*  When I looked today, because I saw it yesterday, the initial response I saw was probably more
*  from liberal sides for being like, this is just to fog the conversation because of all
*  the tax stuff that just came out.
*  And that, like, take this with a grain of salt because of his history.
*  Yeah, but it takes time to gather up that kind of information.
*  I don't buy that it's just when the tax stuff came out, because that seems like something
*  that's been working out for a while.
*  He's got absentee ballots in the car.
*  Just filling them out.
*  People fill them out.
*  If it's not, here's the thing.
*  If that's not real, and this turns out to be bullshit, there should be a punishment
*  for that.
*  Absolutely.
*  Because you are absolutely manipulating people.
*  You know who was fun?
*  Remember the kid, Jacob Wool, who got banned on Twitter?
*  This guy would just set up these blatantly fake things.
*  Like they tried to get, I forget, maybe Robert Mueller or somebody.
*  They tried to get somebody accused of sexual assault.
*  He would do these stunts all the time, this kid, Jacob Wool.
*  And he would just, he's a fun young guy from Orange County.
*  He's a fun guy.
*  And he would just go on Twitter and like try to, he would do fake press conference, Joe.
*  They would call the whole media and they would go, we're about to reveal something spectacular
*  and crazy.
*  And none of it was ever true.
*  And I mean, he would just do this over and over again.
*  So that was just his thing.
*  It was just, he was just having fun.
*  He's a kid having fun.
*  But what I was going to say is, but if it turns out to be true,
*  there should be punishment as well.
*  And like when something like that gets revealed and the more of those that turn out to not be true,
*  like there should be a number of those you could pull off before we go, all right,
*  we can't listen to you anymore.
*  Right.
*  And is he there?
*  Like, I don't know.
*  Because I am, that kid is.
*  That kid is.
*  But the James O'Keefe guy isn't.
*  No, because I have intelligent friends that sent me the Omar thing and they're like,
*  this is very disturbing.
*  Well, I think a lot of it is.
*  I mean, like we were talking.
*  If true, they said.
*  If true.
*  If true.
*  Yeah.
*  Caveats very important.
*  If true.
*  Those two words are like.
*  Yeah.
*  If true.
*  Get that in there.
*  I mean, if I'm in any of the James O'Keefe videos, you know they're a lie.
*  If James O'Keefe has me with a bunch of ballots in my car, we know it's.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're driving a cab all of a sudden.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm driving a cab, you know, and I got all these ballots and I'm speaking to Jamaican accent.
*  Yes.
*  Then yes, unfortunately, I don't know if it's true.
*  I mean, it was it was funny because he was tweeting out that she said something about
*  how vote fraud voter fraud is like this, like the numbers of voter fraud are so minuscule.
*  It's like 0.0006%.
*  Yeah.
*  And then he tweets out this stuff about her and voter fraud.
*  Right.
*  And I'm wondering how big I don't know how big voter fraud is.
*  That's something I have no idea.
*  I've never met a person in my life that's like, you know what I'm going to do today?
*  I'm going to go vote seven times.
*  I've never met that person.
*  The one thing I mean, watching the video, just watching it, it's obviously highly edited.
*  So like you can't say it's not an edited video and that doesn't take a lot of things away
*  because you have to edit the video.
*  You kind of have to edit it, right?
*  Because it's got to be small.
*  You don't know who the people are that are being covered up.
*  I think when I was reading through people that are like,
*  I think Newsweek was digging into each piece of it today.
*  And like, I don't know that they could verify everything because they weren't saying
*  that this was necessarily false.
*  But they asked if that guy worked for who they said he worked for.
*  And I don't think they got a response that said, yes,
*  he verifiably worked for this couple, like these people or something.
*  So that's where it kind of gets.
*  But why would if someone was doing something that illegal, why would they be like,
*  who are you?
*  Strange man with camera.
*  Come look at break law everywhere.
*  What is James O'Keefe's deal?
*  He just goes, I'm just going to figure out a fun conspiracy that's happening.
*  Like he goes, like, how does he get into these things?
*  And then he goes, let's just get some cameras in there.
*  I don't know.
*  It's like a YouTube prank show fused with like political exposés.
*  The problem is the Twitter stuff.
*  The problem is the stuff where he actually did on executives or, excuse me,
*  catch employees that were talking about how they make it so that conservative voices
*  don't get heard.
*  Yeah, which is we know it's a hundred percent.
*  How do you feel?
*  It's real.
*  It's real.
*  And whether or not it is top down or whether or not the tools are available to employees
*  and they act as activists, that's possible too.
*  Right.
*  The other thing too I was reading about this, I think it's about ballot harvesting.
*  And according to this article, it says that it's actually not illegal in Minnesota,
*  but there have been propositions currently.
*  I think Tulsi Gabbard put something up to like have it be made illegal, I think nationwide.
*  So like ballot harvesting is not something I understand.
*  What the hell is ballot harvesting?
*  Explain ballot harvesting.
*  I wish I could, but from what I read quickly about it, certain workers who are not supposed
*  to be paid by anyone, which is part of like, you're not supposed to be paid for this,
*  is where it gets muddy.
*  You're allowed to go collect ballots from people to turn them in.
*  Right.
*  But only three.
*  I think it can't be more than three.
*  Right.
*  That's where it gets really...
*  Yeah.
*  That's what I read.
*  And this guy had like a whole bag of stuff I do on camera.
*  You for me?
*  Come with me.
*  I show you my face.
*  Stupid as that guy.
*  I show you the ballot.
*  Something feels off about it, right?
*  Something feels...
*  Yeah, it feels a little fake.
*  He might want to go to jail.
*  But it might be rigged.
*  He might be the kind of guy that you hire to do something like this,
*  because he's a crazy guy who works for a cab company.
*  Right.
*  And you know, he doesn't give a fuck and he doesn't know there's a camera on him.
*  He doesn't care.
*  Maybe he doesn't know there's a camera on him.
*  And maybe what's edited is this guy going, you know what?
*  Fuck Trump.
*  I hope I'll fucking...
*  If I could vote 30 times, I'd vote 30 times that we need to get him out of office.
*  He's fucking racist and he's sexy.
*  He's a piece of shit.
*  You know, he didn't pay any fucking taxes.
*  That fucking guy is always going off about socialism.
*  He's a fucking socialist.
*  He's like, look, I got the 30 ballot.
*  I fucking cheat.
*  I'm a cheater and a liar.
*  I get paid.
*  I throw these away.
*  I watched that.
*  I was like, what is this?
*  Like what...
*  I mean, people should watch it because it's interesting.
*  So what is this?
*  What is this?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, this election is going to have problems.
*  It's going to be chaos.
*  That's why I'm in Texas.
*  You should move here before November 3rd.
*  I'm locking myself in my studio.
*  I'm doing an event where I go, I'm not leaving the studio until there's a president.
*  Oh, well, you'd be there for years.
*  Well, I hope not.
*  But I'm going to lock myself in.
*  I'm thinking it's going to be Pelosi.
*  48 hours.
*  You think it's going to get that bad?
*  Yeah.
*  And she's going to do all of her press conferences from that very beauty salon
*  where she didn't wear a mask.
*  I heard if...
*  I think if the president doesn't accept the results or whatever,
*  and there is like a time period where it's not decided, she does become the dean.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  She's the third person in charge.
*  She's the speaker of the house.
*  That's how it works.
*  That's real.
*  Well, we need a landslide.
*  We need whoever wins.
*  We need someone to take Florida and Ohio early in the night.
*  I don't know if it counts without the ballots.
*  If they're encouraging mail-in ballots...
*  Here's what disturbs me.
*  When one party wants mail-in ballots and the other party doesn't.
*  I'm like, why do they want it?
*  I don't know the answer to this.
*  I'm just speculating.
*  Why do the Democrats want it?
*  And why does Trump not want it?
*  Democrats are saying COVID is going to keep people from voting.
*  Is it?
*  I don't believe it is.
*  I think that's wrong.
*  Come on.
*  Is it keeping people from buying groceries?
*  Is it keeping people from going to Jack in the Box?
*  Yeah.
*  And I know people that...
*  These people hate Trump so much.
*  It's like, well, then have that be your last act.
*  Have that be your last earthly act.
*  How beautiful would that be?
*  Because all you've done...
*  There you go.
*  All you've done is say this guy's ruining your life every day.
*  Go and die and get rid of him.
*  I wish there was someone to root for.
*  I know.
*  There's no one to root for.
*  I wish there was someone who just stood out as being like this fucking perfect person that I really love.
*  No, we don't have any of that.
*  I wish it was Tulsi Gabbard.
*  I'd fucking vote for it naked.
*  I'd be out there coughing my mouth.
*  I'm voting for it.
*  Well, there were people that were interesting.
*  Sanders was interesting because he didn't seem like he was in the system like everybody else was.
*  It also seemed like maybe a lot of what he wanted to do never would have gotten done.
*  I was interested to see if he could pull it off.
*  When people were talking about what he wanted to do versus what he was talking about what he wanted to do,
*  I was like, oh, they're distorting your voice.
*  They're distorting your narrative.
*  And when I had him on the podcast, we talked for a while.
*  I'm like, you're not crazy.
*  You're just a good guy who wants to do well for the working people.
*  I mean, if that was what it was, I think a lot of people would have been in, but he's just one of those small group of politicians that doesn't get the airtime.
*  You gave him airtime, but you rightly said he had to explain that in 30 seconds.
*  Yes, under normal circumstances.
*  But then I gave this tepid endorsement of him and they used that with all the jokes, the shit that I said.
*  He's homophobic, transphobic, racist, that fucking everything.
*  And they took him out.
*  They took him out with their and then the fucking DNC all aligned together to get Mayor Pete and Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren.
*  That's who they want.
*  All dive out.
*  They quit.
*  And so that they had Biden would get the whole thing was dirty.
*  The DNC has rigged this now like twice against him.
*  Price.
*  Price, they did it.
*  Donna Brazil's book talks openly about it.
*  Right.
*  You know, I mean, dude, it's a dirty organization.
*  They're both dirty.
*  But Sanders was a little too nice.
*  Trump, like Trump just lit the Republican Party on fire.
*  I mean, he went in there.
*  He said McCain's not a hero.
*  I like people who didn't get captured.
*  Went right at Jeb Bush.
*  I mean, they were masked.
*  They were the political dynasty in the Republican Party.
*  He just laid waste to them.
*  Low energy, Jeb.
*  Low energy.
*  Jeb just went in there and Sanders was like, oh, these are my colleagues and I respect them.
*  I'm like, that's not the way to do this.
*  The reason why he did that is because that's who he really is.
*  I know.
*  And that's true.
*  Bullshit.
*  He's not full of shit.
*  And that's why I liked him.
*  I enjoyed talking to him.
*  Yeah, I really did.
*  Now we'll get to sit in Vermont.
*  He'll write a book.
*  Nobody's going to buy that book.
*  No one's going to buy it, but he can write it.
*  He could have a little ice cream.
*  But if you won in the big game, you got to go on thing.
*  You got to look at Klobuchar and go, shut up, you centrist bitch.
*  You don't even know who the president of Mexico is.
*  Then he has to go and just lay waste to everybody.
*  Every time Kamala talked, he should have went, cop.
*  That's what he should have did.
*  Cop.
*  That's what Trump would have done.
*  He needed to be the left Trump.
*  Like Biden talks.
*  Sanders goes, this guy's dead.
*  He's in bed with credit card companies in Delaware.
*  He had the worst criminal justice bill ever.
*  That guy's a corpse.
*  Sanders should have nicknamed everyone like Trump did.
*  Corpse, cop.
*  What's crazy is when there's corruption, but they'll ignore it
*  because it'll interfere with what they want.
*  Like this Hunter Biden shit.
*  Yes.
*  Bro.
*  This was Donald Trump Jr.
*  And is Hunter the one that passed away or no?
*  No, he's the one that's still alive.
*  He's the one that took millions of dollars.
*  Did he marry the wife of the brother?
*  I hope so.
*  I don't know.
*  Something went wild there.
*  What happened?
*  Didn't something go wild, Jamie?
*  Something went weird with the brother that died's wife.
*  And Hunter, I think I could be wrong.
*  Don't quote me on this.
*  But the scandal is that he took a shit ton of money from Russian billionaires.
*  Right?
*  Isn't that the scandal?
*  Jamie's double Googling right now.
*  Hold.
*  Let's start with the brother, the wife of the brother.
*  I could be wrong about this.
*  Hunter Biden, father child with the woman.
*  While dating brother's widow.
*  Whoa.
*  I mean, this is a wild family.
*  Could I see a picture of this girl?
*  Good point.
*  She might have been hot as fuck.
*  Joe Biden is the one on the right.
*  Okay.
*  Hunter and Haley Biden.
*  They broke up after nearly two years of dating.
*  She filed a paternity suit.
*  Same month, Hunter Biden, 49, marrying Melissa Cohen after just six days of dating.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, okay.
*  Maybe he found the perfect girl after he'd already knocked up this other chick
*  and this other chick he fucking hated, but he vowed to take care of the baby.
*  You know?
*  But essentially he's dating the brother's widow.
*  That's interesting.
*  Messy.
*  Sure.
*  People are messy.
*  Sure.
*  Listen, the brother's dead.
*  Maybe he's in love with the widow.
*  Maybe it's a perfect relationship.
*  Sounds good.
*  I don't have a problem with that.
*  I mean, it's weird.
*  It is strange.
*  It's certainly salacious.
*  It's odd that Biden is holding up children and sniffing them.
*  That's odd.
*  That is odd.
*  He's a sniffer.
*  The other thing that bothers me is how much did he get from some billionaire?
*  He got money from a Russian billionaire.
*  I think it was like some very large amount of money.
*  They're all involved in this energy company.
*  They all find these little scams that nobody knows about.
*  And then eventually they come out like once every four years, election year.
*  But I think a lot of them were working for like this same energy company
*  in the Ukraine that's involved with all of these problems.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I mean, Hillary Clinton was involved with the Russians.
*  You know what's hilarious?
*  There's one meme.
*  It's a really good meme.
*  Here it is.
*  Hunter Biden received 3.5 million wire transfer from Russian billionaire.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  He was briefed about sons and Biden was briefed about sons involvement,
*  according to Hunter Biden's barisma.
*  Hunter Biden barisma.
*  What does that mean?
*  Oh, okay.
*  Okay.
*  Scroll back.
*  Oh, the company's barisma.
*  Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son Hunter made money from Russia, China.
*  Okay.
*  All right.
*  I don't know.
*  Maybe he earned the money.
*  Right.
*  But I just know that it's weird that the media is kind of ignoring it.
*  Well, the media is 100% in the tank.
*  They don't want Trump winning.
*  90% of the media.
*  90% of the media.
*  Except for Fox News and Candice Owens.
*  Meanwhile, is she media now?
*  You have.
*  Candice Owens is bigger than anyone.
*  She is.
*  She's on Facebook.
*  She's got like 300 million views.
*  I mean, she's crazy.
*  Giant.
*  And I got to be honest with you.
*  You can't not watch her.
*  Whether you like her or not, she is very smart.
*  She's very articulate.
*  She really knows how to talk.
*  She knows how to talk.
*  But every now and then she'll do something wild.
*  She'll do a GoFundMe for like, Timothy McVeigh.
*  Just toss his suit over Trump affair story after Fox News argues,
*  no responsible viewer takes Tucker Carlson seriously.
*  So their defense was that it's basically like parody almost.
*  And that's why it's not news.
*  Tucker Carlson is parody?
*  Yeah.
*  No.
*  Yeah.
*  His lawyer's defense of what they were saying was that.
*  But this is a smart legal defense.
*  This is what they all do.
*  That's a sneaky move.
*  That's a sneaky move.
*  It's fun.
*  It's the second public time I've heard in a lawsuit that Fox News has admitted they're not news.
*  They're entertainment.
*  Yeah.
*  I think they kind of have to do that like wrestling does.
*  You have to say they don't really wrestling.
*  I know what you're saying.
*  I know what you're saying.
*  But they choose to.
*  It's a smart move.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a little work around.
*  Did you see the thing where Tucker Carlson was playing all these videos of Chris Cuomo
*  talking to Michael Cohen, coaching him on what to say when he interviews him?
*  Did not see that.
*  Oh my God.
*  Fox News, CNN just ignored the fuck out of it.
*  They ignored it and pretended it didn't even happen.
*  Right.
*  And they didn't address it at all.
*  And Fox News played it multiple times over multiple nights.
*  It is clearly Chris Cuomo talking to Michael Cohen and he is coaching him on what to say
*  when he talks to him about the hush payments.
*  It's crazy.
*  But it's just like, I don't know why he would even do.
*  I don't know why they did that.
*  Well, the Cuomo, I don't like the idea that one of them is a governor and the other one's
*  in the news.
*  Yeah.
*  I think maybe he's friends with Michael Cohen and he was just trying to help him out as a friend.
*  If you were going to be, let's just be honest.
*  I'm going to be honest with you folks.
*  If Tim Dillon was involved in some fucked up shit and I had an interview on my podcast,
*  what do I say?
*  You coach me.
*  You and me alone, I would coach you 100%.
*  I would say this is what you should say.
*  Especially if I was trying to help you.
*  Right.
*  I understand that.
*  But if he's friends with that guy, I get it.
*  I understand.
*  The problem is he's a broadcaster on CNN, which is the cable news network.
*  Was.
*  What is it now?
*  It's nothing.
*  I mean, it's nothing.
*  I mean, it's absurd.
*  Chris Cuomo is on there talking about he's got Corona.
*  I mean, they're doing like home videos.
*  I'm like, what is not news?
*  Here's another scandal.
*  Yeah.
*  He pretended to have Corona.
*  There's a little bit of the pretending to leave his basement.
*  I'm pretty sure he had Corona.
*  Well, he said he cured it by chest exercise.
*  I don't buy that.
*  But here's another one.
*  There's a picture of him sitting at his desk holding a 100 pound dumbbell up in the air and
*  bodybuilders are calling bullshit.
*  Oh, interesting.
*  I didn't see that.
*  Also because of the angle that he's holding.
*  Now, Chris Cuomo is, I'm Italian, I could say this.
*  He's a Guinea.
*  A lot of those Guineas are stupid strong.
*  They're monkey strong.
*  I bet he is.
*  A lot of them.
*  Yeah.
*  Listen, there was a guy that used to run a sandwich shop near our house who could curl
*  his own body weight 10 times.
*  Nobody believed him.
*  And this guy barely lifted weights.
*  And he did it before a wrestling meet.
*  He was like a big time wrestler in Newton South.
*  And he wound up losing the wrestling meet.
*  It was like legend in the town because his arms were blown out because he made like 100
*  bucks showing people that he curls body weight 10 times.
*  I don't know if he's trying to be serious with this.
*  This is no, he's fucking serious, bro.
*  Okay.
*  This is where we get our news in America.
*  No, there's a photo and he's wearing a t-shirt.
*  This is different.
*  That's real.
*  That's a real weight.
*  Whether or not that weighs 100 pounds, it might weigh 100 pounds.
*  I don't believe that he has a fake 100 pound weight.
*  He's a big person.
*  I think that guy is pretty large.
*  I'm sure he's not.
*  I'm sure the weight isn't fake.
*  That's the picture.
*  Here's the thing.
*  I saw these people that are complaining and saying it's not real and all this shit.
*  I listen.
*  You can do that.
*  That can be done.
*  People who think you can't do that are crazy.
*  He's bigger than me.
*  He's bigger than me.
*  And there's a video of me on Instagram with a 92 pound kettlebell and I'm cleaning it and
*  pressing it 10 times over my head.
*  That guy's a lot bigger than me.
*  He could hold 100 pounds over his head and do it like that.
*  If I have a 100 pound dumbbell in my arm right now, I could press it.
*  He's bigger than me.
*  He could do it.
*  Some people are fucking strong.
*  I don't have any problem with doing that.
*  It's when he does the news.
*  Challenge to Chris Cuomo.
*  Prove you're not a liar.
*  Prove you can actually lift that weight you're showing with.
*  See, this guy just wants attention because you should know that there's people that are
*  freak strong that could lift that.
*  I like Frank's Country Store.
*  I'll throw in $1,000.
*  That was the guy's name.
*  Frank's Country Store in Newton.
*  It was in Newton.
*  It wasn't Newton Upper Falls.
*  Somewhere in Newton, Massachusetts.
*  Newton Center.
*  That's such a great Boston story where it's like the guy loses the team.
*  We always talk about it because we'd go buy subs there because we'd walk there from school.
*  We'd buy subs from Frank.
*  I thought the guy could curl his own body weight 10 times.
*  He was a tank.
*  He was just a legend.
*  He was just a fucking stacked little guinea.
*  Like this 5'7 guy who's like 5'7 wide.
*  I don't mind people not liking Trump.
*  It's weird when they're angry.
*  I see Chris Cuomo a lot.
*  He's angry.
*  They're angry.
*  But isn't that his job?
*  It shouldn't be.
*  But it's entertainment.
*  Tucker Carlson's entertainment.
*  He's entertainment on the other side.
*  But anyway, Tucker Carlson's been ruthless.
*  Say what you thought about Tucker Carlson.
*  That guy is very good at shitting on people and being smug about it.
*  And Tucker also, if you look at a lot of where he stands politically,
*  he's not like a corporate right-wing guy.
*  Listen, he's wealthy.
*  He's from a rich family, blah, blah, blah.
*  But he actually seems to find a lot of merit in some of the more socialist-y
*  type programs.
*  Like he talks about...
*  He balances his statements out very well.
*  He does balance them out.
*  You'll watch him and you'll go,
*  this guy doesn't seem like some radical lunatic.
*  But he's in that category where everyone's like,
*  oh, he's a white supremacist.
*  Oh, he's a racist.
*  You don't even give him a chance.
*  But this is how partisan we are, how politically divided we are.
*  When nobody wants to listen to anything that anybody says that doesn't even agree with
*  them at all.
*  There's a great fucking documentary from a few years back about the 1960s.
*  And it is, I think it's called Bitter Enemies.
*  It's...
*  I've talked about it before.
*  It's Gore Vidal versus William F. Buckley.
*  Yeah, best of enemies.
*  Best of enemies.
*  Best of enemies, yeah.
*  It's amazing.
*  Unbelievable.
*  It's so good.
*  And you have this conservative in William F. Buckley,
*  who really seems like a cunt.
*  And you got Gore Vidal, who's like,
*  my version of what a liberal should be.
*  That's what I like.
*  Right.
*  An intelligent, open-minded, very well-read, very articulate person.
*  Right.
*  I love that debate.
*  And then when Gore Vidal gets under William F. Buckley's skin,
*  and he says crazy shit to him, and he says, I'll sock you.
*  Yes.
*  Something real dated.
*  You fairy or something.
*  He calls him a fairy.
*  But it's very dated.
*  You'll stay plastered or something.
*  I'll sock you in your...
*  It's like an old timey.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, political cartoon fight.
*  But he was like, obviously, lost is cool.
*  And he lost the debate because of that.
*  Now we couldn't have a debate.
*  We'd have to hide the location because there would be riots outside.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Everybody would hit fire alarms and shut down the thing.
*  Yeah, they'd be shooting fireworks into the debate stage.
*  You can't even have a remotely controversial, non-orthodox opinion anymore.
*  And I hate to say this because I am a left-wing person.
*  It is from the left.
*  Right.
*  The left are the people that are doing this.
*  For the most part, it is.
*  The right might...
*  They might mock people on the left, but they're not trying to shut down speech.
*  The right is not...
*  Well, the right used to do it.
*  They did it a lot in the 90s.
*  They did it a lot with art.
*  They did it a lot with people that were anti-religion.
*  They did it a lot like the Family Values.
*  All those coalitions used to do it a lot.
*  They used to do it a lot when a cartoon did something they didn't like.
*  Well, the left did that too, though, dude.
*  Tipper Gore was the one who was trying to stop the rap music.
*  Absolutely, but she was kind of...
*  That's Al Gore's wife.
*  100%.
*  But she was kind of an anomaly at that point.
*  It was a lot of it was coming from the Christian right.
*  But now all of that has been transferred to the left.
*  Yeah, that's why it's so confusing.
*  Primarily, it's transferred to the left.
*  The left was supposed to be about tolerance.
*  Open-minded views.
*  I remember there was a...
*  I forget the artist's name, but he had a piece called Piss Christ.
*  And it was...
*  Do you remember that?
*  During Giuliani.
*  Yes.
*  Yes, I remember it.
*  Yeah.
*  It came to Boston because I remember...
*  It was a crucifix submerged in urine.
*  That's...
*  There is this Andres Serrano.
*  It's a small plastic crucifix submerged in a glass tank filled with piss, with his own piss.
*  And people were losing their fucking minds that this guy
*  dunked a plastic statue in a bucket of piss.
*  It was like pawning it off.
*  Yeah.
*  And it was like there was like civil war about this.
*  It was a real big issue.
*  Yeah.
*  And I want to say...
*  I don't know.
*  Look at the date here.
*  I want to say this is like 87.
*  85.
*  What?
*  85, I think.
*  85.
*  85.
*  Yeah.
*  He was probably just a bad artist.
*  Yeah.
*  This was post high school for me, and I was still trying to figure out what made sense.
*  I was like...
*  This was your first...
*  I was just getting...
*  So 87 means I was 20, which means I was just getting out of the house.
*  I was just getting out of the house when I was 20,
*  and I was living with my friends.
*  And I was kind of a loser who was also a winner.
*  Right.
*  Like I was a martial arts winner, but I was a loser as far as...
*  If you looked at me on paper, you're like, what are you doing with your life, kid?
*  Right.
*  Like, I don't know.
*  It's a problem.
*  Yeah, it was a problem.
*  And I was trying to figure out what made sense, and I heard about this, and I went to see it.
*  And I also went to see a Yoko Ono art exhibit.
*  One of the Yoko Ono art pieces.
*  Jeez.
*  Yoko Ono, she had a block of wood with nails in it, and there was a box of nails and a hammer.
*  And she encouraged people to participate in the art.
*  Like she wanted you to pick up a nail and knock it into the wood.
*  Wow.
*  And that was her art.
*  She's like, I want to encourage participation.
*  And I had a bit about it back then.
*  I was like, if you want to encourage participation, take the nail, put it in your forehead.
*  I know there'll be a fucking line around the block.
*  There'll be a line of people to get it.
*  This is when I was an open-micer.
*  That was one of my first jokes.
*  You look at that, and it's so bad.
*  But certain comedy specials will be remembered like that.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah, certain things.
*  Certain comedy specials will be like, oh, that was our nail moment.
*  Yeah, don't try that.
*  We've already figured out the art form.
*  You don't need to reinvent it with no audience.
*  You need to redo it.
*  Yeah, there's no need.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's crazy.
*  And this is probably overinflated, all that Spotify stuff.
*  Is this just complete fodder?
*  They have literally said nothing to me about it.
*  Zero.
*  It's never come up.
*  Now, is there someone at Spotify that's complaining about the Abigail Shrier episode?
*  I'm sure.
*  I'm sure there's someone that's complaining about it.
*  Is it a transphobic episode?
*  It's not.
*  They're wrong.
*  They're not.
*  It has nothing to do with that.
*  It has to do with the fact that human beings are actually malleable.
*  We all know that.
*  That's why cults exist.
*  There's a thought process now that if you're talking at all about trans people,
*  you have to be 100% supportive.
*  You can never question whether or not children should be allowed to transition,
*  babies, hormone blockers for prepubescent children.
*  All this is madness.
*  Here's the question.
*  Are there some people who are horribly sad that they transitioned and regret it terribly?
*  The answer is yes.
*  Are there some people that are very happy they transitioned
*  and they're much more happy in the gender of their choice,
*  how they feel than the gender of their birth?
*  The answer is also yes.
*  They vary wildly.
*  What Abigail's talking about in her book, Irreversible Damage, is large clusters of kids
*  who are mostly kids that are socially awkward.
*  Many of them are autistic.
*  Many of them have never had any praise at all in their life.
*  They transition and they get all this praise from people
*  because right now it's in vogue.
*  It's a social contagion amongst that subset of people.
*  And they're at high risk for, they're easily influenced.
*  That was the problem.
*  The word contagion was one of the things they had an issue with.
*  They called it deeply transphobic.
*  It's not transphobic.
*  Contagion is also used to talk about diseases.
*  So that's, but that's not right.
*  But it's social.
*  But yeah, it is language.
*  And this is the problem is that they look at this and they say this is openly transphobic.
*  It is not transphobic.
*  It's not transphobic.
*  No, it's not.
*  I think there's got to be space for conversation.
*  And I think that a lot of this, you know, rigid allegiance to, I mean, listen,
*  we all know that trans people are, in many cases, are much happier when they transition
*  and they have better productive, fulfilling lives.
*  Everybody, I don't think anybody does.
*  Like there are people that don't want that, but they're probably a minority.
*  But here's the thing.
*  It's probably a small minority of people.
*  The spectrum of human beings and their happiness is so fucking broad.
*  Yeah.
*  That to say that all heterosexual people are happy or all homosexual people are happy
*  or all trans people are happy is nonsense.
*  Not true.
*  It's crazy.
*  Right.
*  So when you talk about a particular issue where the uptick of girls transitioning,
*  it's called rapid onset gender dysphoria.
*  This is psychological.
*  Psychologists are talking about this like it's a real issue because there's an uptick
*  of several thousand percent over the last decade.
*  They're looking at this and they're trying to figure out what the fuck is going on.
*  Right.
*  So when that does happen, if you can't discuss it,
*  you will.
*  We've found ourselves in this terrible place where there's no longer nuance.
*  There's no longer informed discussion and you have decided that a subject is off bounds
*  or out of boundaries.
*  Now, if people think that I should have trans people on and talk to them about it,
*  I'm happy to do that.
*  Right.
*  But that's not what they're saying.
*  Right.
*  Now, I don't know what the actual conversation has been from Spotify talking to these employees,
*  but if these employees are listening, I would tell you emphatically,
*  I am not in any way anti-trans, not in any way, in any way.
*  I am 100 percent for people being able to do whatever they want as long as it doesn't harm
*  other people.
*  If you choose to do anything, whatever you want, whatever your personal choice is,
*  I am happy if you're happy.
*  I don't care.
*  Of course.
*  100 percent open-minded.
*  But if you say that I can't talk about something when a woman wrote a whole book and researched
*  it deeply and is talking about not just these children themselves that have grown up and then
*  gotten out of school and then realized they've made a horrible mistake and it's irreversible,
*  that's the name of the book, Irreversible Damage.
*  Right.
*  We can't discuss this.
*  Look, I had a friend who reached out to me and was saying thank you because my daughter
*  has friends and four of them just decided they're trans together and they're all awkward.
*  I've been trying to tell her that this is probably statistically not even possible,
*  that they would all be trans like this.
*  Right.
*  This is, there might be something else and then they read this book or they hear about
*  this conversation and without even looking into it, they just decide that it's transphobic.
*  It's not transphobic to say that some people will regret transitioning.
*  It's just a part of being a person.
*  People are so malleable.
*  They're so easily influenced.
*  For us to deny that doesn't do anybody any good.
*  No.
*  Anybody any service.
*  So this is the main issue they had with that.
*  Apparently, this is the main problem they had was this one particular episode and I'm sure
*  they've had issues with other episodes as well.
*  But like I said before, I'm talking off the top of my head and a lot of times I'm saying
*  shit that I don't even mean because I'm saying it because this is a fucking podcast.
*  If you have a problem with people saying terrible shit and you work for Spotify,
*  maybe you should listen to some of the lyrics.
*  Because some of the lyrics and some of the fucking music that you guys play over and over
*  and over again makes my shit pale in comparison.
*  Pale.
*  Right.
*  If you're listening to some rap music right now, I'm not anti-rap.
*  I love rap music.
*  I'm fucking say it all.
*  Do whatever you want.
*  Go back and listen to NWA.
*  Go back and listen to some of the early shit.
*  Go back and listen to Ice-T, Cop Killer, when the body count days.
*  Yeah, it's wild.
*  A lot of rap is not female-forward.
*  Listen, I'm a fan, man.
*  I fucking love rap music.
*  I'm a big fan.
*  I met Willie D from the Ghetto Boys recently when I did gigs in Houston.
*  I was like a little kid in the candy store.
*  I'm a huge Ghetto Boys fan.
*  I love rap music, but it's a standard.
*  If we're going to apply a standard.
*  It's a type of art and talking shit is also a type of art.
*  You might not like that type of art because it seems too much like a real statement.
*  Sometimes it is a real statement and sometimes it's just talking shit.
*  Yeah.
*  But just-
*  And the fun is in deciphering which is which.
*  Right.
*  I mean, half the fucking time that you and I are talking.
*  If you took what we say out of quote, which is one of the things they did with the Bernie
*  Sanders thing, they took things and put them in quotes and some of them were so ridiculous.
*  That is what people do when they're trying to discredit someone.
*  And what they're doing is they're not being honest.
*  It's not an honest take.
*  It's not a real honest take on who a human being is.
*  It's denial of nuance.
*  It's a denial of all the complexities that make a human being.
*  It's like deciding.
*  Like you said this and you said Meghan McCain.
*  Fuck these tits.
*  Right.
*  She fucked her dad.
*  You're a bad person.
*  You're a bad person.
*  I did not mean she had a baby with her dad.
*  It's certainly possible, but I didn't mean it.
*  But that this is-
*  I get it.
*  If you're a 23 year old woke kid and you're working for this company,
*  you think you're going to put your foot down.
*  Well, isn't it just in the beginning of tech,
*  everybody that got into tech was nerds.
*  It was woke people.
*  People that are like-
*  Right, but here's me on the outside reading these fucking articles.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, oh my God, Spotify censoring Rogan.
*  Spotify's doing this.
*  But it's not happening.
*  Spotify has said nothing.
*  Listen to me.
*  Nothing.
*  They haven't said anything to my manager.
*  They haven't said anything to me.
*  They've said nothing.
*  Right.
*  They've apparently had meetings, but they have a lot of meetings.
*  They have meetings about all sorts of shows.
*  They have meetings about the music they have.
*  They have meetings about-
*  They have people that have problems, especially in this day and age.
*  Look, it's a great company.
*  They're open-minded.
*  They treat their employees very well.
*  They let them have discussions about things.
*  And I don't know what these discussions are like.
*  I don't know what happens.
*  I really don't.
*  But in terms of them silencing me, zero.
*  There's been nothing.
*  Right.
*  There's been nothing.
*  Yeah.
*  And then, well, the new thing I was Roe V. Wade, right?
*  With the new Supreme Court justice.
*  This is a big deal.
*  It was always interested in me about abortion.
*  That lady has like 80 kids.
*  She's got a lot of children.
*  She wants to just fuck and make babies.
*  She's a Catholic woman who likes being on her back, and God love her, and she's a smart judge.
*  Spread that seed.
*  She loves Christ and her husband.
*  And babies.
*  And babies.
*  And she's adopted.
*  Some of them are adopted.
*  She brought them in.
*  She flew them in.
*  Listen-
*  Yeah.
*  God bless her.
*  Yeah.
*  Abortion is a fucking- it's a weird conversation.
*  It's a weird one.
*  You know why?
*  Because it's a particularly human subject where it's like a messy one.
*  I am 100% in favor for a woman having her right to choose.
*  Let's just get that out of the way right away.
*  I'm 100% pro-choice.
*  But when it's like nine months old, what age?
*  Six months?
*  I'm-
*  Five months.
*  Yeah, I'm in favor of abortions.
*  Four months.
*  Up until-
*  18 years old?
*  Up until they start attending meetings at Spotify and complaining.
*  That's when I think you should be able to abort your kids.
*  But anybody who says you are anti-abortion.
*  Yeah.
*  What if it's two cells?
*  Right.
*  What if the process-
*  But those are the same people that are against stem cell research.
*  They're against any type of contraception in many cases.
*  Maybe not, but let's generalize.
*  Yeah, no, but they are.
*  A lot of people that are hardcore anti-abortion are like, we shouldn't be doing anything.
*  Condoms are no good.
*  Birth control is no good.
*  Those people are crazy.
*  They're crazy.
*  Those people are crazy.
*  They're wild, but again-
*  But also the late term abortion people are crazy too.
*  Those are crazy people too.
*  That's a baby.
*  That is a baby.
*  That baby is alive.
*  If you took it out of the body, it would be alive.
*  That's crazy.
*  That's a weird one, man.
*  It's very strange.
*  But people will take a hard line ideology party stance.
*  They feel like I am left-wing.
*  I believe in abortion rights no matter what.
*  No matter what.
*  And if you say up till eight months, what do you think about eight months?
*  Yeah.
*  What do you think about nine months?
*  Can't do that.
*  Can't do that.
*  It's weird, but some people believe in that.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's such a human issue because it's so-
*  There's so many things going on there.
*  Roe v. Wade, if it's overturned, goes to the states.
*  It's not really possible.
*  It's not really possible.
*  I mean, it could be theoretically.
*  You're going to make women carry rape babies?
*  I don't know, but here's what would happen.
*  I think it would go back to the states.
*  Right?
*  It wouldn't be a ban on abortion.
*  It would just make it a state's rights decision.
*  So there would be abortion in still most American states, which again, I don't agree with.
*  I think it should be available in all 50 states.
*  I think those people want to cut off federal funding, any type of federal funding for-
*  Is it available in every state right now?
*  I believe so, yeah.
*  Federally it has to be available, right?
*  I believe so, yes.
*  Yeah.
*  That is what Roe v. Wade stands for.
*  So what happens is if they get rid of that, then states would vote on it and states would decide
*  what the appropriate- they would have to make their laws.
*  See, the problem is what if there's an 18-year-old girl and she lives here.
*  Abortion in the United States is legal, 73 case.
*  Abortion is legal in all states.
*  Every state has at least one abortion clinic.
*  There you go.
*  Right.
*  But here's the thing.
*  If you make it the state's rights and a girl just turns 18 and the law comes into place
*  and all abortion gets shut down, she doesn't have any money.
*  She's fucked.
*  She's fucked.
*  She's fucked up.
*  She doesn't know what to do.
*  And also if she's too poor to afford to go to the state where you can get an abortion.
*  Right.
*  She might never be able to go to it in her state if it's far away.
*  Exactly.
*  It's very tough.
*  It's tough.
*  It's one of those issues where I think that we're never going to have everyone on the
*  same page.
*  We just have to realize that.
*  There's issues in America.
*  We're never going to come together 100% on that.
*  As long as you still have people with a very religious view of when life begins.
*  Because you can't argue with somebody who says if life begins the minute that you have
*  conception then stem cell research, which is very beneficial to people.
*  Stem cell research is advanced to the point where they don't have to do that anymore.
*  Well the good news is two people I think are getting smarter and realizing that they can't
*  legislate things based on a book that was written 2000 years or whatever.
*  I mean you hope that that's the case.
*  But now they're legislating from they're writing the books as we they're writing the new religions
*  as we speak.
*  So this lady that Trump wants to
*  Amy Coney Barrett.
*  What is her deal?
*  Catholic judge only been a judge for three years.
*  Like a guy.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's I think she was only on the district court for three years or something.
*  She's he wants he likes her.
*  She's a traditionalist Catholic.
*  The anti-abortion people dig her.
*  I mean although in and culture doesn't think she's conservative enough.
*  So it's like it's a weird mix out there of like she's a woman.
*  So it's very tough for people to sell.
*  Well they are slamming her now.
*  They're slamming her because she has two black kids, which is pretty disgusting.
*  That she adopted from Africa, which is pretty heinous that they're there.
*  They're writing all these things about.
*  Oh, she's still a racist or let me tell you.
*  And it's like you're going at her family.
*  It's so grotesque that yeah, that's doing that.
*  It's grotesque.
*  She's she's obviously if she's got that many kids, she's obviously a person who cares about
*  children.
*  She cares about.
*  She's not a bit like this is what I don't understand.
*  I don't understand why you're trying to make this woman into a monster.
*  But what their argument on help it because they want someone.
*  First of all, they want Biden to win and they want someone to come in.
*  It's going to be nominated by my opener.
*  My opener has a great joke about that.
*  This guy, Dan Carney, he basically says that like what happened?
*  He basically said he's like Biden's getting lowered into the ground a day after the inauguration.
*  He's got three weeks.
*  It's President Kamala.
*  You're voting for Kamala.
*  You really are.
*  So he made a good point there.
*  So it's like Biden's like Biden's going to spend a few months in the Oval Office,
*  couple of photo ops, and then Kamala's getting in and you're going to jail.
*  Yeah, he just wants to get it on the books.
*  Yeah.
*  I really did it.
*  And then faceplant.
*  Done.
*  Yeah.
*  Bounce off the hardwood floors.
*  Kamala's coming in and then everybody.
*  And then she's going to yask Queen away all over and lock everyone up.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what?
*  So what?
*  Maybe we need that.
*  Maybe we all need to go to jail.
*  I'm open.
*  Maybe that's the only way we turn this country around.
*  Maybe I'm open to it.
*  We have to go so far crazy people on the left that we come back to the middle.
*  Maybe like everyone's so angry at Trump, it'd be a good time to take the crazy train on the left-hand side.
*  People in jail than Trump.
*  Oh, she would.
*  Yeah.
*  Who she has.
*  Yeah.
*  Correct.
*  Who she has.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Not only that, withholds evidence.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Shady prosecutor.
*  Oh, kept people in jail after they were supposed to be released to use them as cheap labor for the state.
*  Disgusting.
*  Fight wildfires.
*  I've heard one good thing recently is that she's into decriminalizing marijuana.
*  I'm voting for you, baby.
*  There we go.
*  Let's do it.
*  She's coming around.
*  Come on, Kamala.
*  Come on.
*  She's coming around.
*  And as far as vice president, she'll be the hottest.
*  She'll be into criminalizing tweets.
*  She's the hottest vice president.
*  She'll be into criminalizing Facebook statuses.
*  Do you think so?
*  No.
*  Who knows?
*  I get really worried about what could happen with big tech if they're, if they just are allowed to-
*  Run amok.
*  Run amok.
*  Trump hasn't done anything to stop him.
*  Nothing.
*  What has he done?
*  Not much.
*  I don't know what he can do.
*  I think he did a very anemic week thing where he was like, you can now try to institute some appeals process if you get the platform.
*  But it doesn't have any teeth.
*  These are private companies.
*  They can do what they want.
*  So the real debate is like, are they public utilities?
*  Are they private companies?
*  I don't know the answer to that.
*  I'm not smart enough to figure out the pros and cons of either.
*  But I just know that when you have such a small three or four companies, these motherfuckers have more power than Carnegie, Rockefeller, all of the people.
*  I mean, these people have access to your thoughts.
*  Look at this.
*  Judge blocks Trump's administration's ban on new TikTok downloads from US app stores.
*  They tried to do that.
*  Overstepped authority with TikTok ban.
*  But the TikTok thing is slightly different because we're not talking about TikTok banning anybody.
*  TikTok will take anybody.
*  They're not banning anybody.
*  Right.
*  What TikTok is doing is they are taking information from you at an astonishing rate.
*  Yes.
*  Like they had an engineer, back engineer of the software, and he said this is the worst violation of privacy features I've ever seen ever in any application.
*  Right.
*  Like it's maddening.
*  It's crazy.
*  It's following you.
*  But let me ask you a question.
*  If they looked at US companies, aren't they doing that?
*  And I'm not saying that China should have our information, but aren't Google and Facebook, aren't they doing the same thing?
*  This is one step up for Apple.
*  And I'm very happy that Apple did this.
*  Yeah.
*  Apple just stepped up recently.
*  And now Apple is going to make it so that you have to pull this up because I don't want to butcher this because this is actually pretty important.
*  Facebook is furious about this because it'll limit the amount of ads.
*  Like you have to sign off on whether or not they can sell your data.
*  OK.
*  Whereas Facebook is saying this is going to cut our money in half.
*  Right.
*  If you give people the option, you say do you want Facebook to be able to sell your data?
*  And you're like, fuck yeah, sell it.
*  Right.
*  Then no one's going to say that.
*  Most people, if you have to click yes or no, they're going to say no.
*  But do we believe them that that's the only way they're getting our data?
*  Look at this.
*  App ad tracking.
*  iOS 14 will give users the option to decline app ad tracking.
*  But no, it's not the only way.
*  But this is a big deal.
*  It's a big step.
*  So scroll up, please.
*  So a new version of iOS wouldn't be the same without a bunch of security and privacy updates.
*  Apple on Monday announced a ton of new features that bake into iOS 14.
*  Expect it out later this year with the release of new iPhones and iPads that it will use.
*  It will allow users to share your approximate location with apps instead of your precise location.
*  It'll allow apps to take a rough location of your identifying precisely where you are.
*  Another option users will have is when they give over their location.
*  OK, but I want the...
*  Oh, wait a minute.
*  Camera and mic recording.
*  Here is it.
*  It will also get a camera and microphone recording indicator on the status bar.
*  Oh my God.
*  Is that what that light is?
*  Then someone's been recording me all day long.
*  Shit.
*  This is what I mean.
*  That's how it pops on usually too.
*  Dude, they're just recording me.
*  This is what I mean.
*  They're all day long.
*  Could be.
*  Motherfuckers.
*  I'm talking shit about people too.
*  Here's like, what's your pops up, I guess.
*  Pal About would like permission to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies.
*  Wow.
*  I just think that, yeah, obviously opt out, but I just think it's like data has become what?
*  They say more valuable than oil.
*  I mean, they're going to find a way to harvest that data from you,
*  whether you're consenting or not.
*  I don't know if that's the case.
*  They have up until now, but if Apple can figure out a way, because it doesn't benefit them.
*  Here's what they'll do.
*  If these apps harvest the data.
*  What it benefits them is if the apps give them a piece of the pie when you sign up,
*  and there's some apps that now are requiring subscription on their website.
*  They'll probably just start giving people a better deal on certain things if they share their data.
*  I mean, that will enable people to go, hey, I want to save a few bucks.
*  I don't care if you.
*  100%.
*  That's probably the direction they're going.
*  Well, there's a great-
*  They're not going to give up these billions and billions of dollars of selling.
*  But it's not whether or not they give up.
*  Right.
*  Apple cuts them out of it, and then everybody has a choice.
*  You can get a Google phone, get an Android phone, and then you just give away all your
*  information for free.
*  Or Apple institutes these new privacy laws or privacy features, and you get to decide
*  who tracks you.
*  You get to decide whether or not they can use your information and sell it.
*  You get to decide whether or not you get ads sent to you.
*  If Apple does that, it'll commit to them forever.
*  Your data is a commodity that you never really signed off on, and you didn't even realize.
*  Look, there's benefits to it.
*  Your phone knows how many minutes it takes for you to get home.
*  You just look at your phone and it says, Tim, you'll be home in 22 minutes.
*  It's like, oh, okay, great.
*  But how does it know that?
*  Because it's tracking you.
*  If your phone knows what you like and where you're going or what's on your calendar,
*  there's certain conveniences to it tracking you.
*  Right.
*  And the trade-off for that is that you lose all privacy.
*  But the trade-off that's positive is, say, if you go to a website and it recommends you
*  an ad, and the ad is some things you're into.
*  Maybe you've been looking for a nice Yeti Tumblr, and it recommends it.
*  And you're like, oh, I don't know.
*  I think all of it ends up being okay if you always trusted the government.
*  If you always trusted the federal government.
*  But it's not the government.
*  Well, but.
*  This is companies.
*  Yeah, but there's government people that are using that information, 100%.
*  But that is not the real problem.
*  The real problem is government, companies rather, like Facebook,
*  are literally making hundreds of billions of dollars off of your data.
*  Right.
*  And you're like, well, what are you providing?
*  You're providing a way to get addicted?
*  A way that I'm just arguing with my grandma about Trump?
*  They want to keep you on the needle.
*  That's what they want.
*  But there's an argument to be made that this is a commodity that no one knew was
*  a commodity until it was too late.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  The cat was ready out of the bag.
*  Yeah.
*  It's too big.
*  It's a big thing.
*  It's a big thing.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a gigantic thing.
*  And if a company comes along like Apple and says, you know what?
*  You shouldn't be allowed to do this.
*  We're going to make it so like if you want to give away your privacy,
*  you should have a little boxy check on every little app that you saw.
*  And then if that comes along, I will be a fucking loyal Apple customer for life.
*  I just think whether it's the government or whether it's private corporations,
*  the whole fear here is that malevolent forces or bad actors get a hold of this data.
*  Right.
*  They do.
*  And so that is the major problem, whether it's intelligence agencies, whether they're
*  keeping tabs on you for a reason.
*  You know, say you're-
*  Snowden uses Signal.
*  Right.
*  Do you know what that is?
*  I don't know what it is.
*  Listen, iOS is far more secure than SMS, right?
*  Right.
*  But iOS, whether it's iMessage, iMessage is more secure than SMS.
*  If you have a Google phone, unless you're using WhatsApp,
*  you're sending a regular text message.
*  What is this?
*  Speak freely.
*  Signal.
*  This is what Snowden recommends.
*  And the thing about it is it's encrypted you to me and it doesn't go to a third party.
*  So iOS, if you have an iMessage, it goes to the Apple server.
*  Signal does not.
*  So Signal, if you and I are sending messages to each other on Signal-
*  They're not going to the server.
*  Right.
*  And you can set it so that your message self-destructs in two minutes.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  There's different things you can do, but it's not going somewhere else where someone
*  else can intercept it.
*  It's all encrypted.
*  SMS, which you have if you have an Android phone.
*  I have an Android phone and I have an Apple phone.
*  I just have an iPhone.
*  My iPhone is iMessage, but occasionally like the green text message,
*  those green text messages anybody can pick up.
*  Right.
*  And they're also disgusting on the phone.
*  They look horrible.
*  They look weird.
*  It's vomit colored.
*  They don't look that bad when you have the night mode on.
*  No, they do.
*  I don't mind them.
*  Why do you have an Android?
*  Is it to fill what the poor people feel like?
*  I like to have both operating systems because look, this doesn't look that bad.
*  Look at that green.
*  Tim Poole has an Android.
*  He sends me Android.
*  I would say I look at that green and I'm reminded of sewage.
*  I'm reminded of golfing.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe a nice pool table.
*  Green, green cloth.
*  Yeah.
*  Perhaps.
*  iOS is more secure.
*  It's more secure in that regard.
*  Like iMessage is more secure.
*  The thing about iMessage that's superior, there's a couple things.
*  One, the big one is pictures.
*  If you send me a picture in iMessage, it's a big high resolution picture.
*  If you send me a video, it's a nice high resolution video.
*  And you can send it to me through AirDrop and it's like in perfect quality.
*  Right.
*  If you send me a fucking video through a Google phone, it comes out looking like a flip phone
*  from the late 90s.
*  It's so bad.
*  I've sent it to people.
*  I'm like, oh my God, I have one of them notes, a Galaxy Note.
*  It's a beautiful phone.
*  It's like beautiful screen, high resolution, the camera, the video is amazing.
*  But if I text it to somebody, it looks fucking like dog shit.
*  The Galaxy cameras, like a lot of the Android cameras are better than iPhone cameras.
*  They're not better.
*  Okay.
*  They're just great.
*  Very good.
*  They're really good.
*  But so is this.
*  Everything's great now.
*  They're all great.
*  Sony makes ridiculously good cameras on their phones.
*  They have an Xperia.
*  I think it's an Xperia 2.1 or 1.2, I think it's called.
*  I forget what it is.
*  But they have like amazing video stabilization and all these different like their cameras
*  are off the charts.
*  And if you're a photographer, the Sony ones allow you to get in there and tweak shit.
*  And so the Samsung ones, you can do a lot of tweaking and fucking with the settings.
*  And Samsung has incredible zoom.
*  Like they have this Galaxy S20 Ultra and it has this crazy zoom on it, man.
*  Yeah.
*  You can shoot movies on a lot of those and the iPhone.
*  Amazing.
*  And the Galaxy also has a 5,000 milliamp battery.
*  So it's like the battery will last you forever.
*  But you're still sending text messages.
*  They haven't figured out an encrypted version of a messenger.
*  So unless you have friends, you got to talk them into getting WhatsApp
*  or you got to talk them into using Signal.
*  It's like, why can't they get that shit together?
*  And they don't even have an ability to transfer data.
*  Like you can't send me a picture through Bluetooth.
*  Like if you have an Android phone and I have an iPhone, you can't send me a picture.
*  Not native at least.
*  I mean, there might be applications that are after the fact now.
*  Yeah.
*  They're just not quite there yet.
*  They're not there yet.
*  But I still feel like it's just, you know, it's a system of control that is going to
*  be more and more omnipresent.
*  Here's the other thing I should say.
*  When I have my Samsung phone, my texts are not green.
*  I can make my text any color I want.
*  It's totally customizable.
*  Like just on my phone.
*  If you're texting me.
*  Yeah, I've only ever seen the green ones.
*  You've only seen them come to you.
*  Correct.
*  That's because iMessage, they make you look like shit if you send a green text.
*  They know people hate it.
*  They know comics like you have bits about how poor you look.
*  I mean, it's disgusting.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just it's weird that Google hasn't figured that out.
*  That Android hasn't figured out a way to make a version of like iMessage that works on iMessage.
*  It's like I guess Apple has it locked down.
*  They want it locked down.
*  Yeah.
*  That seems to be what they want.
*  They want you in that walled garden.
*  Yeah.
*  That walled garden.
*  That seems to be the issue now is that you can't do anything without being in business
*  with some of these companies, whether it's Facebook, YouTube, Google, Amazon.
*  Like you have those five companies that run tech.
*  You got to be in business with them if you want anything.
*  You got to be on the grid.
*  You don't really have too much of an option.
*  And now they're instituting this thing saying, oh, well, you can opt out of the data.
*  But I guarantee they find a work around with that.
*  Probably find a work around.
*  And that's the real issue.
*  And then you start thinking about like what kind of now they want to get rid of cars.
*  They want everybody to be in fleets of self-driving cars.
*  This is something that people want.
*  I mean, Gavin Newsom has said, let's phase out cars by 2035.
*  Well, he said phase out gasoline cars, new gasoline cars.
*  But he's a fucking idiot.
*  Yeah.
*  The fact that they're doing this in the middle of like their education system is falling apart.
*  These poor kids were getting a terrible education before.
*  Their top priority should be fixing their education system.
*  Instead, how much time are they wasting putting together this thing, this virtue signaling thing
*  where you're trying to make banned cars that new cars that are gasoline cars by 2035.
*  Their whole argument is now that the fires are here and people realize that it's a problem,
*  blah, blah, blah.
*  That's true.
*  There's a political will.
*  But listen, you got to fix what you haven't fixed first.
*  Agreed.
*  You know, I mean.
*  The other thing is, you know, they pass a carbon tax in New York City and they start,
*  the Ubers started costing a lot more money.
*  A lot of people in New York City use Uber pools to get to work because the subway in New York,
*  which is an old legacy system, doesn't always run efficiently.
*  So people that were going to work in Ubers and especially the pool, Uber pool feature,
*  it was very cheap.
*  They instituted a carbon tax and a congestion tax.
*  All of a sudden, the Uber rates went up.
*  And now people were unable, couldn't afford to get to work.
*  So it's like, yes, you're helping the environment, but you're damning people in that respect.
*  Here's my favorite thing.
*  They just passed.
*  They're allowing transgender inmates to go to the prison of the gender they choose.
*  So violent male sex offenders who decided they're trans can go to women's prisons.
*  That's going to work out well.
*  There's no way that's going to be bad.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  There's a threat that Bridget Phetasy sent me a thread on Twitter where this
*  this journalist goes over all of the issues that they've had with people turning trans in Canada
*  and doing this and all the horrible people that have gotten into female prisons.
*  Abusing it.
*  And the difference between female prisons and male prisons about how much more violent male prisons
*  are and how horrific.
*  Aren't female prisons violent?
*  Barely.
*  Well, that is disappointing.
*  Yeah, I see some of the women going in there and I'd like to believe that they are violent.
*  I think some of them are not violent.
*  Damn it.
*  I just want equality, Joe.
*  Well, I just want violence.
*  Yeah, I just want equality of violence.
*  It's not going to happen.
*  I want women out there beating the shit out of each other, throwing each other.
*  It's mostly pillow fights.
*  Yeah, they're in their underwear.
*  They're just talking shit about each other.
*  Just waiting for guys to come and fuck them.
*  Yeah, that's girls prisons.
*  Just pillow fights and cattiness.
*  It's all only fans.
*  What percentage has OnlyFans grown during the pandemic?
*  Massively.
*  Well, everyone's become a whore.
*  I mean, everyone, people that were one or two steps.
*  I didn't know how many people were one step away from legitimate prostitution.
*  I have told several of my friends that are better looking than me, be a whore.
*  Like, do it because there's no jobs.
*  Christina Paszynski was explaining this to me.
*  Yeah.
*  Her and Tom are moving out here, by the way.
*  Yeah.
*  And they were out here the other day.
*  We went to dinner and she was telling me that Aaron Carter, is that his name?
*  The singer with the tattoos on his face.
*  He has a little meth thing.
*  He's got an OnlyFans account and he jerks off in front of people.
*  Well, listen.
*  He makes a lot of money, apparently.
*  Good for him.
*  His career has been not great.
*  She said it in front of my kids, though.
*  She's like J and his D.
*  That's what she said in front of my kids.
*  Yeah.
*  So he's J and his D.
*  Yeah, on OnlyFans.
*  And I'm like, well, no one knows what that means.
*  Well, I mean, it's one of the only jobs left.
*  My 12-year-old's eyes are lighting up.
*  Listen, you're either a cam girl or you're instigating a race war.
*  Those are the jobs.
*  Those are your two jobs in America.
*  There it is.
*  Oh, Aaron Carter is now doing porn.
*  Former child pop star recently joined cam soda.
*  Oh, same shit.
*  So he was a former child pop star.
*  Well, they're real new.
*  Yeah.
*  Aaron Carter.
*  I mean, these face tattoos.
*  I mean, you see everybody in LA with them.
*  A lot of these young kids have them.
*  Yeah, a lot.
*  Well, not everyone, but a lot of these kids in LA have them.
*  And they just, OK, so you had an OnlyFans.
*  His brother was in the Backstreet Boys.
*  Can you not do porn on OnlyFans?
*  You can do whatever you want, really.
*  But most people use it for.
*  $27 a month.
*  Look at him holding his pecker.
*  People get on OnlyFans because they want a reasoned discourse.
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
*  What is this?
*  $72 for three months.
*  What is the most a gal can charge?
*  You can get a lot.
*  And I've seen people then explaining how this whole system works for them.
*  And like, they have a whole, it's not pyramid scheme.
*  But like, if I got you guys to both sign up for a certain amount of time,
*  I get shares of your money, too.
*  What?
*  It's like incentives for growing.
*  Really?
*  It's a pyramid scheme.
*  So he got a bunch of his other buddies to jay their D's in front of people.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Whoever got him to sign up.
*  That's what pimps used to say to hookers.
*  They'd be like, find a few of your friends.
*  This is Jizz Lane Maxwell.
*  There's no difference.
*  Yes.
*  He's got 120 people to look at if you feel like signing up.
*  Wow, how many fans does he have?
*  It doesn't tell you that part, I guess.
*  Oh, he's private.
*  But some of them then show their back and details.
*  Keeps it private.
*  Not safe for work content.
*  1,200.
*  1,200, that's it?
*  I mean, I don't know if this is better than doing cameo.
*  OK, well, let's think.
*  It's not cameo.
*  So he's basically making somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 grand a month.
*  Jay and his D.
*  Sure.
*  1,200, 2.27 bucks.
*  Not bad.
*  It's not that bad.
*  It's not bad.
*  It's better than working.
*  Listen, if he had to work a job and he had that thing on his face,
*  and people are like, you're the guy who jays his D for 27 and 1.
*  They get mad.
*  Go back to doing that.
*  Hey, shut up.
*  I'm just trying to work.
*  But it's amazing how that during the pandemic,
*  because everyone's home, nobody's doing anything.
*  I guess everybody's just jerking off.
*  He also sings and plays guitar in the nude.
*  Oh, nice.
*  Dancing, fan Q&As, other sultry activities that you'd expect from a 10-show.
*  I love that he's playing guitar in the nude.
*  He's still trying to hold on to it.
*  You know what I mean?
*  He's like, I got a new song.
*  And everyone's like, buddy, let me see your asshole.
*  Yeah, that's not what this is.
*  Spread your cheeks.
*  He's like, I wrote this about.
*  Yeah, no one cares.
*  Can you fit the neck in your asshole, please?
*  I paid money.
*  I paid American money for this.
*  Be very disappointing to pay for his OnlyFans.
*  And then he's strumming a guitar.
*  Maybe the music's really good.
*  It's not.
*  How do you know?
*  I'm guessing it's not, Joe.
*  He throws a fit in court after ordered to forfeit guns.
*  500 of them he was forced to.
*  Oh, my god.
*  A result of his sister.
*  What does it say?
*  Scroll back up.
*  Sister winning a restraining order case.
*  Oh, well, that's not good.
*  He's threatening his fucking sister.
*  A lot of these people that get famous very young, it's a rough road.
*  It is unmanageable.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know anybody who's managed it.
*  Yeah.
*  Miley Cyrus was on the podcast a couple of weeks ago, and I told her, I said,
*  you've done it about as good as you could do it.
*  Right.
*  She's got a lot of barriers up, though.
*  You tell.
*  You could tell.
*  She's been through it.
*  Yeah.
*  You can't get that famous that young.
*  She's 12 years old playing arenas.
*  How the fuck?
*  It's crazy.
*  Yeah, man.
*  I mean, I just who and it was funny, her talking about on the show that
*  was it her mom or grandma was saying, well, it's better than her being in LA doing drugs.
*  Like, what's right?
*  Yeah.
*  Why is that the choice?
*  Like, what are you talking or better than being back home doing drugs?
*  Well, I guess they felt like this is her ticket out of the life of but hurt.
*  She was never going to be her life.
*  Her dad was a famous country music star.
*  Her voice is so harsh.
*  She's got a great.
*  She's a she's a phenomenal talent.
*  Oh, my God.
*  She's amazing.
*  I mean, her talking voice is so harsh.
*  Yeah.
*  Sounds like mine a little.
*  It's rougher.
*  Wow.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yes.
*  Then mine.
*  You want to play it?
*  Let's play some of it.
*  Play some of her.
*  Play some of it.
*  Listen.
*  And by the way, I should say this.
*  I'm not knocking her.
*  I'm a fan.
*  And that's one of the people like, oh, Spotify, you put my service on.
*  No, I fucking love Miley Cyrus.
*  Right.
*  I really do.
*  I'm a giant.
*  I think exactly what it stands for.
*  Oh, my Jesus Christ.
*  That's it.
*  She's a 45 year old waitress in Florida.
*  An X ray.
*  And it kind of shows you almost like in those thermal type colors of the activity of your brain.
*  There we go.
*  She had operation on her throat.
*  Can she still sing?
*  Was it polyps?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Like an angel.
*  Kill, right?
*  Like an angel.
*  Yeah.
*  Great.
*  Well, that's good.
*  Dude, I listened to her music before.
*  I told her this.
*  I showed her an image of me before I filmed my Netflix special.
*  I was listening to her song Malibu and like dancing around backstage.
*  Wow.
*  Gets my mind off of comedy.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  Trying to lose myself.
*  Yeah.
*  And I've been a big fan of hers for a long time.
*  I think she's fucking super talented, man.
*  Her voice is beautiful.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Have you ever heard her cover of Jolene?
*  It's amazing.
*  Fuck, man.
*  I've heard it's great.
*  It's so good, man.
*  It's so good.
*  Let's hope she's not an OnlyFans in two years.
*  Vocal cord surgery will require weeks of silence to recover.
*  And this was in 2019.
*  All we need Trump to do is like, I was going to say have vocal cord surgery,
*  but his biggest thing is Twitter.
*  So it doesn't matter.
*  You can't.
*  I mean, that's what's great about Donald Trump.
*  He could lose his voice and it wouldn't matter.
*  He could still inflame people with just his fingers.
*  Yeah.
*  You have to cut his hands off.
*  It would maybe even be better if he had one of those.
*  Yeah.
*  Joe Biden.
*  If he had one of those things.
*  The debate is tomorrow night.
*  That's so ridiculous.
*  It's crazy.
*  Are you going to be here or you're doing a show?
*  I'm doing a show in San Antonio tomorrow night.
*  There's a few tickets left, but I just added it because I said I just want to do a show
*  while I'm here and everything in Austin is RIP Cap City.
*  Gray Club is not open.
*  I'm hoping we can bring it back.
*  Wow.
*  I'm going to open up a club here.
*  I hope you do.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm just in the middle of a lot of things.
*  I'm in the middle of a lot of things.
*  I'm working on a lot of stuff.
*  We got a lot of things happening.
*  Yeah.
*  But that will be one of the things that I'm going to work on.
*  That would be great.
*  I mean, none of us know when the store is opening.
*  Nobody knows anything about anything in LA.
*  My concern is I don't want to, there's a bunch of things.
*  I don't want anybody getting sick.
*  Of course.
*  I want to be able to do it where the people who work there, wait staff and folks can be
*  safe and can make a living.
*  Um, there have been talks about promising vaccines that are, they're showing promise.
*  There's four in trial.
*  Yeah.
*  Moderna, AstraZeneca.
*  Johnson and Johnson, is that one of them?
*  I believe that's one of them.
*  And then Pfizer.
*  Like there's, there's, there's a few that are, and I spoke to a doctor who said they
*  all seem to their safety ratings are good, but their effectiveness is, that's what's
*  going to be debatable.
*  But he did say it's better to have safe vaccines.
*  It may not work as well because you could always get other ones instead of ones that
*  have all these other problems.
*  Oh, Jesus, Jamie.
*  Well, vaccine trial stopped after neurological symptoms detective.
*  Listen, I'm glad he's telling us the truth.
*  Can you go back to iron Carter's dick?
*  We're trying to be positive.
*  Jesus.
*  Drug maker says it halted a coronavirus vaccine study because a woman who received the
*  experimental shot developed severe neurological symptoms.
*  Jesus.
*  All right.
*  No vaccines.
*  Sorry.
*  Here's the thing.
*  If it's a trial, I don't want the vaccine.
*  I'd let everyone else get it.
*  There's only one person that gets that out of a hundred people that are on the trial.
*  When you ramp that up to millions though,
*  you got thousands and thousands of people that are fucked.
*  The way I feel about it is I would like everyone else to get it.
*  The vaccine and I because when everyone says we need a vaccine,
*  no one's thinking about getting it themselves.
*  My manager, her dad got the Lyme disease vaccine back in the Dizze and it gave him Lyme disease.
*  Geez.
*  Yeah, they stopped doing it.
*  They stopped doing the Lyme.
*  I think they deny that it gave people Lyme disease, but he got fucked up from this vaccine.
*  Yeah, interesting.
*  It's actually a coincidence.
*  You actually got Lyme disease right before we gave you the vaccine.
*  A tip in the doctors.
*  Sorry.
*  We didn't mean it.
*  Really sorry.
*  Vaccines are creepy.
*  I've never gotten a flu vaccine.
*  I've never gotten the flu.
*  I wanted to ask you this.
*  I'm glad we brought this up.
*  Robert Kennedy Jr.
*  Praising?
*  Legit?
*  Anti-vaxxer?
*  Pro-vaxxer?
*  I would take what he says and literally think about it.
*  I've heard him speak.
*  I mean, he has that disease with his voice.
*  What's his voice, Alan?
*  I don't know, but he has like, there's some very rare disease he has, I believe, with his voice.
*  He just doesn't like vaccines.
*  I mean, listen, there's a lot of credible people that not saying all vaccines are bad,
*  but saying that there are real problems with certain vaccines and the amount of vaccines
*  that kids are getting.
*  They're getting a lot of vaccines in a very short period of time.
*  So he was on Mike Tyson recently.
*  Let's listen to him.
*  My grandfather and grandmother, Joseph Kennedy and Rose Kennedy, were major figures in my life.
*  Imagine you're on Mike Tyson's hot box and you're high as fuck and you're talking to
*  those guys.
*  So that's how he talks?
*  Is that Chris D'Alea to the right?
*  Right.
*  Chris D'Alea's found a job.
*  Isn't it interesting that he's doing Mike Tyson's show?
*  I watched this, though.
*  At the end of it, he says he's not an anti-vaxxer.
*  No, I don't think he is.
*  People are just a clarification.
*  The thing about vaccines is the thing about all medication and basically everything.
*  There's a certain number of people.
*  If you make things mandatory, if you make everyone have to take a vaccine,
*  think about there's 300 million people and most of them have been vaccinated.
*  You're going to have a lot of people that have problems.
*  That's just a sheer numbers issue.
*  Yeah, it's just going to be a big issue.
*  And if you look at the vaccine court, how many settlements, and by the way, I should say right
*  away, I'm pro-vaccine.
*  I've been vaccinated.
*  My kid's been vaccinated.
*  Right.
*  But I know people who have had problems and I know people whose children have been vaccinated
*  who said that immediately Ron Funches was talking about it.
*  And he's like, I don't know if that's what caused it, but right away my kid shut down.
*  And we noticed it.
*  Like it was instant and we thought he would come back and never came back.
*  He was different before.
*  And he's not the only one that I've talked to.
*  So there's a lot of concerns about things like that happening.
*  But they don't know if this was something that was inevitably going to happen or if
*  the vaccines were a catalyst, if it's, you know, but vaccine courts have paid out money
*  to a large number of people.
*  Does that mean vaccines are bad?
*  No, vaccines are the reason why most people are.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a reason why we haven't died from fucking smallpox and syphilis and all the
*  other disease.
*  Syphilis?
*  Oh, they have a vaccine for syphilis?
*  I don't know if they have a syphilis vaccine.
*  I think that $4.2 billion has been awarded as of October 2019.
*  Wow.
*  It's just one of those things I think where people know so little about it and people
*  are very uncomfortable because a lot of the-
*  Scroll up.
*  Let me see what that means.
*  No, you're right.
*  Well, it's scary.
*  I was breaking it down by a year.
*  That was just so I could get you the biggest overall that this is the Wikipedia for.
*  For vaccine compensation.
*  National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.
*  That's what he was talking about, which is what he got into.
*  He's still a lawyer and he's into all, he's fighting this fight.
*  This is the thing.
*  It's not that we shouldn't vaccinate because if we didn't vaccinate all these fucking kids
*  that are getting the mumps now and measles and all these different serious diseases,
*  it can really fuck people up.
*  They're coming back.
*  They're coming back because people don't want to vaccinate their kids.
*  Right.
*  It's fucking complicated, man.
*  Most things that involve people.
*  They're very complicated.
*  Yeah, but I think that a lot of people are, because with coronavirus, they are just skeptical
*  because the whole thing has been just handled poorly and nobody knows what's going on and
*  the information is so bad and nobody trusts anybody anymore.
*  The idea that you're just going to show up to CVS and somebody's going to just shoot
*  you in the arm with this synthetic coronavirus, people are kind of, that's scary.
*  It's not even a synthetic coronavirus.
*  Whatever the hell it is.
*  I don't know what it is.
*  They're called mRNA viruses and what that is is it's vaccines, rather mRNA vaccines.
*  It's a vaccine that stimulates the production of certain proteins that will fight off the
*  coronavirus.
*  Okay.
*  So it's not like you're getting an inert version of the virus like every other vaccine.
*  So, okay, well now we got a whole new fucking thing.
*  Now it's a whole other problem.
*  It's a whole new one.
*  This is a new thing.
*  Well, people are just, people just are uncomfortable with any, all information being disseminated
*  right now is just, you know, up for debate.
*  You have people that are screaming at each other going, this is their thing.
*  I read an article the other day that said vaccines are on their way.
*  The next article said there'll never be a vaccine.
*  I don't know what to think.
*  I'm reasonably intelligent and I don't know what to think.
*  A lot of this country is not reasonably intelligent.
*  So they don't necessarily, like I don't blame them for being skeptical and being a little
*  scared and going, you know what?
*  I'll take my chances out there instead of getting a shot in the arm in a Walgreens.
*  They vaccinate you in like a shitty pharmacy.
*  You're buying like eggs and you get a shot and they say, good luck.
*  And who's doing it?
*  Somebody making minimum wage who has no idea what they're doing.
*  Like, yeah, yeah, it's, it's a little terrifying.
*  Yeah.
*  I'll take my chances.
*  Take my chance with coronavirus part, which I've heard not to get conspiracy on this part,
*  but like I've heard the word nano getting added to RNA and vaccine stuff.
*  And then when I heard the nano chips, Bill Gates, Bill Gates got a nano robot,
*  but I don't know what's accurate or what's not accurate.
*  Boy, nobody took a bigger hit during this coronavirus lockdown than Bill Gates.
*  Well, he became a villain.
*  I don't think he's a villain, but I also think that, listen, we're living in a time now of
*  Batman era villain, like where like these guys have billions and billions and trillions of dollars.
*  I don't think he's a villain.
*  I'm not saying he's a villain.
*  I don't think he's a villain.
*  I'm not saying he's a villain.
*  Listen, but here's what's fucked.
*  Bill Gates has done more for humanity than most rich people would ever imagine doing.
*  That guy's built schools and wells and help people get educated.
*  Look, him and his, his wife, the Gates Foundation,
*  they've done a tremendous amount of positive work.
*  But what I'm saying is-
*  But he's wading into the controversial waters of the vexed.
*  So listen.
*  But what I'm saying is that during this pandemic, he's become a villain for the first time ever.
*  He's like 70s.
*  Because he wants to deliver people the mark of the beast.
*  That's all.
*  That's the only reason people are upset with him is he wants to deliver people the mark of the beast.
*  But listen, when he go, listen, you got to expect a certain amount of,
*  a certain amount of discussion when you're making,
*  when you are the guy inserting yourself into this very kind of volatile debate about public health
*  and you're telling people they need to be vaccinated to travel.
*  And these are the standards that you want people to adapt.
*  Listen, man, he could have just been a billionaire that swam in his fucking pool.
*  Why do you think he talked about that?
*  Like telling people that they need to be vaccinated?
*  He, I guess he, if you give him the benefit of the doubt, he wants to help people, I guess.
*  Let's not give him the benefit of the doubt.
*  Okay. If we don't give him the benefit of the doubt, we'll say that he wants the world to look
*  exactly like he thinks there's necessary and unnecessary things.
*  He thinks that he should be in charge of people's health, public health,
*  or that he thinks that a group of scientists or him and his foundation
*  should be in charge of public health.
*  To his found, really?
*  No, I mean, listen, there's also billions of trillions of dollars to be made off some of
*  these vaccines.
*  Does he, is he making money off vaccines?
*  I don't know what he's doing, but I'm telling you.
*  He has so much money. Why does he need more money?
*  Why does anyone need more money? I don't think he's doing it for money.
*  I'm not saying he's an evil guy. I'm saying that we cannot write a blank check.
*  I feel like you're saying he's an evil guy.
*  We cannot write a blank check to anybody.
*  We can't write a blank check, Joe, to anyone.
*  Look at him. The next app. Well, that's in 2015. That's when he planned it.
*  Listen, I don't trust anybody who wears an outfit.
*  This fucking sweater with this.
*  Can I just say this? I'm being totally serious.
*  The button shirt underneath him and Dr. Fauci created AIDS.
*  That's all I'll say.
*  That's all I'm going to say.
*  Why?
*  You know, people fuck around.
*  Just for fun.
*  And they created AIDS. So that's the only reason I'm a little skeptical.
*  No, but in all seriousness, our society shouldn't be structured where one guy stands up.
*  Because, by the way, in order to travel and go places and open your businesses,
*  here's what you need to do.
*  And we talked about that in the beginning of the show, but the government doing it.
*  Why is it better for private billionaires doing it?
*  Well, here's the thing.
*  Why are we listening to him talk about public health issues?
*  Like, yeah, he's the guy who founded Microsoft.
*  Phenomenal question.
*  Yeah. I mean, that's a great question.
*  Is it just because he's rich?
*  What if I stepped up and started telling everyone it's time to get vaccinated?
*  Everyone's got to get vaccinated.
*  People be like, hey, hey, hey, relax.
*  You're a fucking comedian and a cage fighting commentator.
*  Why are you telling everybody to get vaccinated?
*  That's why I don't tell people to vote.
*  So why is he doing it?
*  Well, that's why people are a little suspicious.
*  He's stepping out of his lane.
*  Now, that sweater with the shirt on.
*  Isn't the sweater the creating of AIDS, the mark of the beast?
*  All of it's a problem.
*  There was a great, somebody made a great meme.
*  I've said this before, in the show, he wanted to shoot a missile
*  of dust and sun to help climate change.
*  I heard about that.
*  When you have the capability, when you have the capability to do that type of shit,
*  someone's got to check.
*  No one's checking him.
*  No one checks Bill Gates.
*  You know why I don't trust him?
*  Why?
*  Because he talks shit about Tesla.
*  Oh, did he?
*  Yeah.
*  Interesting.
*  And him and Warren Buffett, that other fraud,
*  Warren Buffett's like, oh, I live in my little house.
*  I've always lived in and I drink Coke.
*  He does.
*  He's a trillionaire.
*  He's a cold-blooded trillionaire.
*  God love him.
*  But stop with the act.
*  Stop with that's an act.
*  He has a military base under the house.
*  Stop with this fucking act.
*  I eat Dairy Queen and all this horse shit.
*  You've got 80 billion dollars.
*  Can you stop with the horse shit?
*  He lives in a small house and he drinks Coca-Cola.
*  I'm sure.
*  It's not that small.
*  It's small for a guy who's worth 80 billion dollars.
*  Yeah, but you don't.
*  But those are the guys you got to watch.
*  I want my billionaires in palaces like Donny T.
*  It's a nice little house.
*  I want my billionaires living like Trump in a gold apartment.
*  Well, listen, he's a cheap fuck.
*  He likes to keep the same house.
*  I know.
*  Look at that.
*  What about that?
*  Go there.
*  A sneak peek.
*  Go down, Jamie.
*  To the left.
*  It's a beautiful little house.
*  A sneak peek.
*  What is that?
*  A sneak peek into Warren Buffett's what?
*  His other house.
*  Oh, no.
*  That's a shit house.
*  He's got other houses.
*  This motherfucker.
*  Whatever.
*  How many houses you got, Warren?
*  Him and Gates are such good friends because they're both doing this thing where they're
*  like, we're just little old men.
*  I'm just saying everybody's got to get watched.
*  I understand.
*  Everybody's got to be watched by me.
*  You should think that people are watching when you open your trap and tell everybody
*  they've got to get vaccinated.
*  People are not predisposed to trusting billionaires delivering them edicts.
*  I don't want an edict from anybody, from the government, from a billionaire.
*  I don't want anyone to go, here's what you have to do.
*  Explain to me why.
*  Tell me why it's beneficial.
*  And then, by the way, even still give me the freedom to do it or not.
*  So here's what he said about Elon and Tesla.
*  He was saying that this Tesla truck thing, that building semis is not likely because
*  of the fact that the batteries are very heavy.
*  Elon's like, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
*  We're already doing it.
*  They're already deep.
*  They have 500 mile semi trucks.
*  They're already operational.
*  They're a year away from implementing them nationwide.
*  They have them.
*  Have you seen a Tesla semi?
*  Yes.
*  Yeah, they exist.
*  So he's talking about it's not likely planes.
*  SpaceX, Tesla, and...
*  What is he saying?
*  All these billionaires have egos.
*  They all fight each other.
*  Okay, good day.
*  What's your opinion about Bill Gates decorations referred to electric trucks regards?
*  He has no clue.
*  Yeah, he doesn't have a clue.
*  Elon is balls deep into that world.
*  And then Elon's also mad because Bill Gates bought a Porsche, Taycan, electric Porsche.
*  These...
*  And he said, after he bought that,
*  Elon said, I've been underwhelmed when I talked to him.
*  Oh, that's funny.
*  Well, you know, the whole thing is that these guys have egos and everybody wants to...
*  Just give me a little info before you put a chip in my arm, please.
*  There's a company that we were watching the video.
*  They put chips in people's arms so they could use a vending machine.
*  Yes.
*  See, I don't think that's good.
*  A lot of Americans, they'll go for that.
*  What if they fire you?
*  They turn your chip off.
*  Well, they're going to do that.
*  I mean, they're going to do that.
*  I mean, this is going to happen.
*  They cut it out.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, they can deactivate you.
*  Hold you down and cut your chip out.
*  You have two choices, Tim.
*  Keep that chip in your arm for the rest of your life and it's just inert.
*  But we'll still track you.
*  We have to track you.
*  Right.
*  Or...
*  Well, Spotify chipped me on the way in, which I thought was strange.
*  They told me they weren't going to do that anymore.
*  They just did a chip in my neck when I walked in.
*  They told me they weren't going to do that.
*  I was like, okay.
*  Well, they knew that you talk shit on trannies.
*  They do.
*  They said he's only...
*  I liked the Republican ones.
*  I love Caitlyn Jenner.
*  I love...
*  If you're a transgender person, you're against gay marriage, I'm already a fan.
*  I think I fucked up by saying tranny.
*  You can't even say that anymore.
*  You can't say it.
*  Even though trannies call each other trannies.
*  And gay people call gay people faggots, but you can't say that.
*  Don't say it.
*  Don't say it.
*  You can say it because you're gay.
*  Yes, but if...
*  You get a pass.
*  Can you hand out passes?
*  I look too racist to say it.
*  My wife still doesn't believe you're gay.
*  She says you're just doing that just for the jokes.
*  We had a meeting at WME and they said, we've got to figure something out.
*  And I said, well, can we try?
*  And they said, gay guy who's kind of uncomfortable and says the wrong things.
*  And I said, let's try it out.
*  And I told my wife, who lives in Jersey with our three kids, who I send money home to,
*  every week, she's a lovely woman, slightly larger, but working on it.
*  And, you know, she gets it.
*  We're just making the money, you know?
*  But well, it's just the gay in the media is like is gays become annoying now.
*  Everybody's annoyed because gay people are like, you better be.
*  And it's like, shut up.
*  Nobody wants supposed to be fun.
*  They miss the will and grace gay.
*  They become moralists.
*  It takes all the fun out of it.
*  You're not supposed to take balls out of your mouth and tell people how to live.
*  That's really the reality.
*  That's the reality.
*  They miss the queer eye for the straight guy type of gay.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, they that's a fun guy.
*  Well, yeah, because now the gays are bookish and angry and they're in Antifa.
*  And they're angry.
*  And it's just like, it's not fun.
*  It's supposed to be a little fun, a little dirty and naughty and wrong.
*  That's the whole fun thing about everything.
*  Naughty.
*  It's not supposed to be, you know, Norman Rockwell.
*  Like, I'm sure that you listen, you could do it.
*  You could have the family could do anything you want.
*  But part of what is fun about being gay is that it's not like a fucking you're not sitting there.
*  Like we have the transgendered lot, the drag queens reading to the kids.
*  I'm like, great.
*  I don't care about that.
*  But it's just like, why are you doing that?
*  It's horrible and not fun.
*  Nobody wants to read to kids in a library.
*  Nobody.
*  What do you think is happening?
*  Do you think it's because on Twitter and social media, people can say things and get likes so
*  that they make these statements and they feel like they did a good job in making that statement?
*  A lot of people have resonated with them.
*  People are just very invested in being a victim.
*  So when gay people started to mainstream and you got marriage and you got this and that,
*  you weren't really a victim anymore.
*  So then what happened is people started saying queer and this and that.
*  And we're very different.
*  And now we don't.
*  And so now, like a lot of these non-binary people with all due respect, it's not a fight,
*  is that a lot of these people are white women in upper middle class colleges like Wesleyan
*  and Oberlin and places like that who don't want to be a victim.
*  I mean, they don't want to be an oppressor, but they're rich white chicks.
*  So by saying I'm non-binary, you're automatically now you're not in
*  the hierarchy of oppression anymore.
*  You've been victimized by a gender patriarchy that has enforced these things on you.
*  And that might non-binary.
*  It might stick.
*  Great.
*  I have no problem.
*  I don't care.
*  But it also might be like bell bottoms.
*  Like 20 years from now, a guy might be like, yeah, your mother had no gender in college.
*  She was a nut.
*  She used to burn down the federal courthouses in Seattle.
*  What did Douglas Murray say about not calling them the really neat attention people?
*  He's funny because he makes so many people mad.
*  He's always just sitting there.
*  He's just a very large and it just says, you know, Joe, let me say a few things and
*  we'll be in the news in four minutes.
*  You know, like he's brilliant.
*  His book, The Madness of Crowds is fantastic because he nails it all.
*  All the craziness is going on.
*  A lot of it is weird generational because older gay people don't understand this.
*  A lot of them.
*  Oh, no, they don't get it.
*  Yeah.
*  They don't get it.
*  That's like Palm Springs, those gay guys.
*  No one took COVID less seriously than gay people that had money.
*  Like they were all buff, these buff guys walking around, no masks.
*  They took it less seriously than people that watch Infowars.
*  Like they were like, this is fake.
*  They survived HIV.
*  They're like, we all beat AIDS by lifting weights.
*  No one cares.
*  We're not fucking taking COVID seriously.
*  So this whole idea, they don't understand.
*  They'll be very honest.
*  They go, I don't understand.
*  They go, what do you mean gender is not real?
*  The whole point of my life is that gender is real.
*  That wasn't attracted to that gender.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the whole point.
*  Yeah.
*  So at the end of the day, like, what do you mean that's not real?
*  So I've just been an idiot forever.
*  I just wanted to get beat up in school and then have to join a gym and get buff.
*  Like, what are we doing?
*  That gender is not real thing is so dumb.
*  Where it's like space is fake.
*  The thing you bring up.
*  It's the same idea.
*  It is the same thing.
*  It's sick.
*  We're in trouble.
*  Who cares?
*  No one cares.
*  This is the other thing.
*  I think people are so invested that people hate them and people care.
*  No one cares.
*  No one cares about your life.
*  No one cares if you want to be a man or a woman.
*  Nobody gives a shit about anything.
*  Nobody cares about anything.
*  Truly.
*  They care about if there's a line of Chick-fil-A and if their water bill's paid.
*  They don't give a shit about your life.
*  But this idea that people are oppressing you and they're constantly invested
*  and they're hunting and they're behind the trees and they're coming for you.
*  No one gives a shit.
*  There are small motivated groups of people that want to restrict your rights.
*  But by and large, most people, they might be like, oh, that's weird.
*  Or, well, that's a little odd.
*  But they're not fuming with hatred at you.
*  No.
*  No, they're not.
*  They're not.
*  And it makes people feel powerful or worthy.
*  If someone is.
*  Yes.
*  I want to be hated for the right reasons.
*  You are.
*  Yes.
*  And I believe I am.
*  I think you are.
*  When I used to say I was gay on stage, people would be shocked.
*  Now, sometimes people start clapping.
*  Oh, you don't want that.
*  I don't say it anymore.
*  You know what I say and said?
*  What?
*  I say Ruth Bader Ginsburg's burning in hell.
*  Because I want that reaction.
*  I'd rather that reaction.
*  I've chosen another way to say it.
*  You know?
*  It's a fun time to be bad.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a fun time to say ridiculous shit.
*  Because even though there's a lot of blowback,
*  there's also a lot of people that get really happy that you're doing it.
*  Yeah.
*  There's not enough people that are pushing back.
*  A lot of people aren't.
*  And the people that come out to these shows, they've been having so much fun
*  because they want this.
*  This is what they want.
*  Everybody wants somebody to push back and do it in a funny way that everyone can enjoy.
*  And that's what I think we need to do.
*  And I want people that are free to express themselves because they're not.
*  Most people are not.
*  Yeah.
*  Most people are not.
*  And also let Hollywood go in this crazy direction.
*  They're going into who gives a fuck.
*  We have all the tools to just create our own thing.
*  You've showed everyone that.
*  And it's just like people are over it.
*  People are over.
*  What are you going to sit in a writer's room and write for some show?
*  Did you see that Emmy's shit?
*  Horrific.
*  Jimmy Kimmel and it was an Anthony Anderson?
*  I don't know.
*  Who was it that he was with?
*  I am checking.
*  I think that's what I heard.
*  Was so weird.
*  It's weird.
*  That they that he said, yeah, this sounds good.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You're supposed to clap here, Jimmy.
*  Say Black Lives Matter.
*  He says Black Lives Matter.
*  Say it louder, Jimmy.
*  Yeah.
*  Black Lives Matter.
*  And he's like clapping.
*  I'm like, what are you doing?
*  Is it a parody?
*  I didn't know.
*  It's a hard thing that when you're looking at it, you're like, are they making fun of it?
*  What is it?
*  It's weird.
*  They're trying to make it funny.
*  It's just there's no audience.
*  And they didn't try it out in front of an audience.
*  And that needed work.
*  Like I see what you were trying to do.
*  There's probably, you got some really good writers to do that.
*  But you got to take some chances.
*  There you go.
*  Anthony Anderson.
*  Jimmy Kimmel looks a little uncomfortable.
*  I can't.
*  Yeah.
*  It's well, I think that's part of the sketch, though, is that he's supposed to kind of look
*  uncomfortable.
*  That's part of the fun about it.
*  But it's just not good.
*  Nobody needed someone to write something really that.
*  Yeah.
*  Something someone to write something really funny.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, and then take a risk.
*  It just it just.
*  Comedy's supposed to live in those gray areas and there's no gray areas anymore.
*  So like, that's a real big problem.
*  That's a big problem.
*  That's a big problem.
*  Especially for anything corporate.
*  Louis made a good point.
*  He said that when you criticize both sides, you end up illustrating a deeper truth, which
*  is about humanity, which is what comedy is supposed to do.
*  Yeah.
*  So if you look at two sides and go this and this, you kind of try to make fun of them.
*  You have no sacred cows or whatever.
*  You end up illustrating something deeper about humanity, which people can learn more from.
*  And then, you know, reorient themselves in a productive way about any issue.
*  Yeah, that does make sense.
*  Yeah.
*  And that is you have to be able to look at both sides.
*  And in this day and age, that's not possible.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like you if you're on I should say it's not possible if you're on a corporate television
*  show.
*  If you're on television, if you're doing a late night talk show, you got no shot, man.
*  There's too many cooks in the kitchen.
*  And they're the worst.
*  I mean, they're just not funny.
*  They're very strange.
*  They don't look happy.
*  Jimmy Fallon does not look happy doing his show.
*  He looks like he's chained to that desk.
*  It's very strange.
*  He's talking to muppets.
*  He's talking to Miss Piggy.
*  There's muppets singing on the show.
*  It's dystopian.
*  It disturbs people.
*  They're running at high altitude.
*  Yeah.
*  I guess just air in the room.
*  Get that kind of money.
*  And you say to yourself, like, I just want to be stay.
*  I always wonder why those guys don't just jump ship and like, oh, go make a movie, go
*  do something else.
*  They can't make movies.
*  Yeah.
*  Because none of those guys like Jimmy Fallon, they're not going to make movies with Jimmy
*  Fallon.
*  Right.
*  They're not.
*  I mean, maybe they can make a movie, but I'll make an Indy.
*  Go do something else.
*  The guys who make the movies are already making the movies.
*  Right.
*  Seth Meyers or Seth Rogen, rather.
*  He's making the movies.
*  These famous guys that are, you know, Adam Sandler, they're making movies.
*  Right.
*  Like for you to say, I've never made any movies before, but I've been a talk show host.
*  I want to make a movie like that might work, but you got a gig that pays you fucking 10
*  million a year.
*  Why stick with this gig?
*  What are you stupid?
*  Why risk it?
*  Why risk it?
*  Well, maybe I'll just do a podcast.
*  Well, what are you going to say?
*  Wild shit on your podcast.
*  And then they're going to cancel you from your show.
*  Then you're in trouble.
*  Your podcast doesn't make enough money yet.
*  You can't do it.
*  But nobody, what's amazing to me is nobody leaves.
*  Like Ellen's back.
*  Nobody walks away.
*  Nobody retires.
*  Like she's got hundreds of millions.
*  She's got so much money, but she's back.
*  She doesn't care.
*  She's back.
*  Well, I think she wants to redeem herself.
*  That's probably true.
*  Like during the COVID, nobody got, she got taken down harder than Bill Gates.
*  She did.
*  So Bill Gates was like here.
*  She got taken down.
*  But I think they'll forgive her.
*  By the way, if you were having a problem, if you were in a car accident, everything like that,
*  and you just sit in there and you want somebody to help you,
*  and you see Ellen and Bill Gates, does that make anyone feel comfortable?
*  No, I think they don't give a fuck.
*  Let's be very honest.
*  Like if two of them were walking towards me and I had like a tire out, I would fake my own death.
*  I just, I don't, something on a guttural level, I go, oh.
*  She dresses like an executive on Westworld.
*  She's waiting for you to die.
*  Yeah.
*  Watching you on the screen.
*  She's tough, man.
*  Is the Indian going to shoot him?
*  Hmm.
*  Did you see Vin Diesel's song?
*  And they had the crowd dancing to it.
*  Don't tell me Vin Diesel's singing.
*  Don't you do it.
*  This is very-
*  Don't you do it.
*  It's very bad.
*  The Emmys, who's that for right now?
*  Nobody.
*  What's your target audience?
*  Nobody.
*  If you're sitting at home and you're an Emmys writer, who are we doing this for?
*  Not the 27 million people that are about to be evicted.
*  That's true.
*  That's not who it's for.
*  That is what's real too, right?
*  Yeah, that's what's real.
*  Yeah. I mean, they should have not had it.
*  I think it's for young kids in high school that want to one day be on 30 Rock,
*  you know, or a show like that, create a show like that.
*  Vin Diesel, this is on Kelly Clarkson's show?
*  Yes. She's got a crowd.
*  She has a show?
*  People, like they have screens flipped up vertically for the audience so she can see
*  them and there's people at home like they're doing for the NBA games.
*  Okay.
*  I guess Vin has a new song and-
*  Is he singing right now?
*  No, I think he's talking to her and then they play it here for the audience.
*  Where is it?
*  Yeah, right here.
*  So they're showing, which is the weird part where they must have told these people they'll
*  have to dance and see the smiles.
*  Let me see what this is.
*  Give me a little bit of it.
*  Stop.
*  I heard enough.
*  Horrible.
*  No, not as bad as Drew Barrymore's talk show.
*  How bad was it? Everyone said it was horrible.
*  It doesn't even make sense.
*  What's wrong? Is she on drugs? What is it?
*  All of it.
*  Yeah.
*  Just, I don't know. Like the writing, the overacting, it's just, it's confusing, man.
*  It's like, have you seen it, Jamie?
*  There was some clip I saw that I think it might've been Tom and Christina put up.
*  It was like not-
*  It's so bad. It's like, how did you let that slide through?
*  Like someone needs to tell her.
*  I've heard her on talk shows though.
*  Who let that?
*  Yeah, who's selling the chopping block?
*  She seems smart and funny and interesting on talk shows and then doing her own, she's
*  over the top and really acty-owdy.
*  Yeah, it's bad.
*  It's, oh, you want to hear a little bit of it? Here we go.
*  Pay your offer normally. I just thought since you were closing soon anyway, and I just think
*  your bosses should actually know what an amazing person you are, that you will simply not break
*  the rules. But then I was curious, has anyone else ever tried to find a clever way in when
*  like the signs say no entry, so to speak? I love receiving a no after I've tried everything.
*  Stop. That's enough.
*  Yeah, I mean, all the good writers are dead.
*  They're all dead and this has got to die. And they should, I mean, at the end of the day,
*  it's just, that's why you should just like, it's just like podcast Drew and if people like it-
*  But if she podcasted and just be herself-
*  Yeah, I think it would be better, be much better.
*  She's doing stand up there.
*  Well, she's trying to be very big and animated and no one, yeah.
*  But she hasn't done stand up before.
*  It's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  She's doing stand up, but you haven't done stand up.
*  She's another one who's been famous and she's two or something, right?
*  Oh, that's right.
*  So I mean, it's like, I mean-
*  What was the ET? Was she on ET? Is that what she was on?
*  Oh my God.
*  She's been in the business forever.
*  That's so long ago.
*  Yeah.
*  That's so long ago.
*  Yeah. I mean, that's where it ends.
*  That's 82?
*  This is a lesson for everybody in a theater arts class right now.
*  You could be Drew Barrymore doing that show or Aaron Carter jerking off.
*  Those are the two options.
*  Just wait until you're older.
*  You got to develop a personality and go through some struggle and pay your own bills.
*  Like, I just don't think it's right.
*  And this is one of the things that I was talking about in Miley Cyrus.
*  I was a child actor as a kid and I failed.
*  Congratulations.
*  No, I was on Sesame Street three times.
*  Were you really?
*  Twice.
*  I was on Sesame Street.
*  You could snuffle up.
*  I did the polka with snuffle up, I guess.
*  Legitimately.
*  I was a child actor and I failed because I had the same voice I do now and it was disturbing
*  to the casting director.
*  I'm glad it didn't work out.
*  I was a cute little kid but I would say, I would be like, hello.
*  And they'd be like, this is gross.
*  When did you give up?
*  I was from sixth.
*  First play was sixth, sixth to 12th and then 12th.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Thank God you gave up before your puberty kicked in.
*  Yeah.
*  And then, but I got out but I was in that game and I was trying to audition against people
*  like Jonathan Taylor Thomas, like real deal dudes who made it.
*  Whose idea was it for you to do that?
*  I really liked doing it and I was really like into it.
*  I wanted to be, I wanted attention.
*  I wanted everything.
*  And so my mother and father, they're boomers.
*  They're like, fine.
*  Make a little money, pay our mortgage.
*  You know what I mean?
*  They're with Long Island scum.
*  Love them both but you know, so.
*  I have a friend who got famous when he was young and his parents ripped him off.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Found out later in life.
*  They would have done that to me too.
*  They would have absolutely taken everything.
*  Those two.
*  Yeah.
*  They would have mismanaged it.
*  Did an audit.
*  Yeah.
*  They would have screwed it all up, both of them.
*  So I'm glad that it didn't work out for that sake because they would have taken all the
*  money and blown it.
*  It wouldn't have been funny.
*  I'm glad it worked out because you gotta go through some shit.
*  You gotta live.
*  You gotta live.
*  You gotta live.
*  It's just, it's hard enough to be a person, just a grown person.
*  Everybody knows that.
*  It's hard to be a grown up.
*  It's really hard to be famous.
*  It's hard.
*  It's hard to manage it and it's way harder if you grow up famous.
*  Because you never had a reality.
*  Old people know who I am now.
*  You know they always know who you are?
*  Right.
*  Well, you're fucked because it's like cement, but you're mixing it wrong.
*  You got too much water and it's never gonna harden.
*  You can't take the water out.
*  Yeah.
*  Like you're already fucked.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what it's like.
*  It's a difficult thing.
*  Your level is very difficult.
*  Somebody that's really well known, it can be very difficult.
*  I got a slow drip.
*  My level is kind of fun because I get a few people in a restaurant go, hey man, that's fun.
*  Meghan McCain.
*  Yeah, you were fans.
*  We like your podcast.
*  That's fun.
*  But then at your level, it gets a little invasive.
*  It gets weird.
*  It gets invasive.
*  But I had a slow drip.
*  I got it over a long time.
*  Right.
*  I've had a slow fame drip since 94.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  And then now it's just this is a...
*  Yeah.
*  You can't go to an airport without people.
*  It's a whole thing.
*  It's a thing.
*  Yeah, it's a thing now.
*  People come up to you.
*  I've been at the comedy store.
*  People come up to you and they're like, dude, let me just show you this video.
*  Well, they want me to do things with them.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what's weird.
*  I need you to help me with this project.
*  Let me help me with this project.
*  Oh, dude, you'd be amazed.
*  The fucking a number of people during the day that email me or get a hold of friends.
*  Like, hey man, I don't want to get you this, but this guy wants to talk to you about this.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's hundreds.
*  Yeah.
*  It's constant.
*  Yeah.
*  Because they think that they know, hey, you know that guy?
*  Hey.
*  Right.
*  I got this thing.
*  I've been trying to make this new kind of pickle.
*  Right.
*  Like, if I could.
*  Yeah.
*  Can you invest?
*  If I could just get a hold of him.
*  I've had no bullshit.
*  A thousand people asked me to invest in things.
*  What's the weirdest way someone's tried to get on the show?
*  Has there been like weird ways?
*  Oh, sure.
*  I don't know.
*  Somebody FedExed himself to the studio.
*  The beautiful thing about me not reading comments or anything like that is I don't
*  have to read any of that.
*  Right.
*  And I have good people that filter out all that shit.
*  Right.
*  You know, they've done like Twitter campaigns.
*  Right.
*  Tweet at him.
*  Tweet at him.
*  Here he is.
*  So here he is.
*  This is me.
*  See?
*  Look at that.
*  Look at that.
*  I should have made it.
*  We just had to walk around Snuffleupagus.
*  How did you know it was Tim?
*  Is that you?
*  Yeah, it's me.
*  And come on.
*  Dancing with that small Hispanic woman.
*  Are you sure that's you?
*  That's absolutely me.
*  How do you know that's you?
*  It was MK Ultra Mind Control.
*  I want to see your little face.
*  I look different now.
*  It's all from the fucking bird's eye view.
*  I don't see shit.
*  I'm not buying it.
*  Wait a minute.
*  You can tell.
*  So I was starting to get fat.
*  Tim Dylan.
*  I was starting to get chubby.
*  That is you.
*  You can tell.
*  I was starting to get chubby.
*  That is you.
*  Yeah.
*  So weird.
*  What were you thinking right there?
*  Like, I'm really on TV.
*  I was thinking that this is really not what I thought it was going to be.
*  Did you meet Snuffleupagus outside of the outfit or did they keep that a secret from you?
*  Big Bird used to smoke cigarettes outside.
*  He was this really kind of guy named Carol something and he looked very like,
*  like creepy.
*  Well, no, just meth-y.
*  Dangerous.
*  Like just smoking cigs and kind of like.
*  Big Bird smoked cigs in front of the kids?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, he was sitting outside in a storia, coffin of storia studios.
*  What year is this?
*  19.
*  I was, you know, nine, so 1994.
*  Wow.
*  You could still smoke cigarettes in front of kids back then?
*  Oh, back then it was kids would just shut up.
*  We would take my friend's mother would drive us around.
*  She would smoke butts.
*  My friend's father would smoke butts and roll the windows up.
*  Oh, that's the dirtiest.
*  That's the dirtiest.
*  He would smoke Marlboro's.
*  We're not getting cold.
*  Yeah.
*  Because of you kids.
*  Yeah.
*  The windows go right up.
*  So that was when you could treat kids like, you know.
*  Smoking sections in restaurants seem like such a thing of the past,
*  but it wasn't that fucking long ago.
*  What year was that?
*  I worked in them.
*  So it must have been like 2000 and three, four, five, somewhere.
*  New York was earliest.
*  New York was first.
*  Well, LA was a big deal because they stopped it in bars.
*  And I remember Drew Carey was complaining.
*  They said, I don't think Drew Carey even smoked,
*  but he was just complaining for the business for Barney's Beanery
*  because they blocked it at Barney.
*  And everybody's like, what?
*  Barney's Beanery.
*  We even have a smoking section was a little ridiculous
*  because just smoke goes everywhere.
*  Everywhere.
*  Yeah.
*  How could you have a section?
*  I guess the world just smelled like smoke when you were growing up,
*  like all the time.
*  Yeah, but casinos, you could still smoke.
*  Yes.
*  That's what's fucked.
*  They barely can, you know.
*  Really?
*  Really?
*  It's frowned upon.
*  Half the area you can't, like if you're at a table, you can have a cigarette.
*  But like walking around most of the places, like no smoke.
*  But please, no smoking.
*  I think they probably don't want you dropping ashes on that floor
*  and burning the carpet.
*  Part of it, yeah.
*  There's a lot of assholes who walk around with cigars too.
*  I'm in Vegas, I'm a fucking, I'm a winner.
*  It also might be the casino dependent.
*  Well, the ceilings are so high and they filter the oxygen.
*  Do they really pump oxygen in there to keep you awake?
*  That's what they've said.
*  Not awake, but it's probably because it's such an enclosed space,
*  you have to get some fresh air in there.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know about keep you awake.
*  Have you been since the COVID?
*  No.
*  I've only been to Vegas for the fights and the fights are at the UFC Apex Center.
*  Have you stayed or do you just fly back?
*  No, I fly in and out in a day and it's weird being there, man.
*  It's like everybody's wearing a mask and they have very strict laws in Nevada,
*  so like everybody's masked up.
*  Yeah, I just think that that town's gonna have a tough time back.
*  They're gonna have a real tough time bouncing back, but if they are back,
*  they will make money.
*  Yes, of course.
*  People love Vegas.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  They love being there.
*  It's just whether or not, the town itself though, my buddy Randy was telling me,
*  it's hurting, he lives there, he said it's hurting bad.
*  He's like, it's hurting bad.
*  Most people burnt through their savings within the first month or two.
*  Do you think LA's gonna come back?
*  Dude, I don't know.
*  Jamie, you were just there, you said it was horrible.
*  Yeah, it was weird.
*  I was in three airports, LA, well four technically I guess.
*  LA, Columbus, Austin, all pretty empty,
*  for like you would think the pandemic is happening.
*  O'Hare Airport last night.
*  Packed.
*  Slammed.
*  Slammed.
*  People were running around everywhere, full flights, every plane,
*  everyone was saying it was full, every flight I got on they were like,
*  this is a full flight.
*  That would make me uncomfortable.
*  A full flight with strangers wearing a mask.
*  I haven't done a full flight, but I've done flights and I gotta be honest with you,
*  you don't feel that in the plane because the oxygen's, they circulate, they refilter the air.
*  They said that the transmission rates are probably lower there than if you were in
*  like an elevator or an enclosed small room or something like that.
*  It's weird how contagious this disease is.
*  Well, you say that, but I know a guy who just tested positive and his girlfriend's
*  not positive and they've been living together.
*  It's so weird.
*  It's like very strange.
*  It's weird.
*  She's probably healthy.
*  Yeah.
*  But he's healthy too, they're both like fitness people.
*  Taking the old schloss.
*  She might've been doing that.
*  I don't know.
*  Just taking a little laugh.
*  Is that the antidote?
*  Is that the vaccine?
*  Maybe it's in the loads.
*  It might be.
*  Antibodies.
*  But listen to this, he was, Bill Gates comes out and says we need semen.
*  I guess he was in breast smoke today, someone was saying.
*  The antibodies?
*  I just take the vitamin D and I think that's what you can do.
*  Yeah, vitamin D is huge.
*  Zinc, vitamin C, vitamin D.
*  Don't eat white sugar and inflammatory ice cream and bullshit.
*  Try to sleep, that's hard.
*  Well, that's the thing about breast milk too though.
*  Breast milk is phenomenal for a kid's immune system.
*  There you go.
*  Makes sense.
*  But it's not nearly as big of an issue with children anyway.
*  The one of the things the Florida governor did is he put up a chart that showed
*  the fatality rate for people that are under this age, over that age, and he went through
*  all the things, which is accurate.
*  But you're just talking about fatality.
*  The long-term effects are creepy.
*  Yeah, that's an issue.
*  There's some people that have devastating long-term effects and they don't know how
*  long that's going to last because obviously this has only been around for six months.
*  But there's people that got it four or five months ago that are still suffering from fatigue.
*  But they're also saying that that's a lot, a lot of diseases that aren't reported.
*  People just have some weird neurological reaction to it and it just flares up some type of whether
*  it's chronic fatigue or Epstein-Barr or something.
*  I mean, dude, it's just a bad situation where you hope that we get out of it,
*  but there doesn't seem to be ... There's no great option here.
*  The great option is take care of your health.
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  Just that's the option.
*  Make sure you make your immune system as durable as possible.
*  This is what's driving me the most crazy about our government.
*  You don't hear a peep about that.
*  You don't hear a peep about that, which is why I was talking on my podcast, I said as a joke,
*  I said, tell people to eat their vegetables.
*  It's like you got to tell people to vote.
*  There's so much better advice or equally as good advice.
*  Tell them other things and nobody tells anyone anything.
*  So yeah, they've said not a word about immune health and they've said not a word about
*  preventative measures you can take other than sitting in your house and going broke.
*  Yeah. The crazy thing in LA, they're talking about schools and when a school is going to open up.
*  They said after the election.
*  Could you at least try to pretend that you're not being political?
*  This isn't totally political.
*  After the election, do you have science?
*  Kamala Harris will open the school.
*  She'll cut the ribbon to open the school when it's ... Yeah.
*  Do you have science?
*  She's going to smother Biden with a pillow.
*  I mean, Fauci ... Fauci's got to go.
*  They're going to celebrate. They're going to celebrate in the hotel room.
*  And she's going to get on top of them, film out.
*  She's on the vitamin D thing. I've saw this in the last week.
*  This guy's got to go. This is a big mistake.
*  Yeah. He's been taking that. He's been saying about taking vitamin D.
*  He says if you're deficient, the problem with that is everyone's deficient.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, people don't think they're deficient. 79% of America is deficient in vitamin D.
*  Yeah. The other thing about ... but Fauci just seems to me ... like I've always believed
*  Italians shouldn't be doctors. Or governors.
*  Yeah. Or governors. Correct. They shouldn't make cars either.
*  100%. But we should have a Jew or an Asian giving us advice.
*  I like that.
*  Nobody wants a short ... Fauci. Nobody wants a pizza.
*  Fucking delivery guy giving people advice on coronavirus.
*  Give us an Asian. Give us a Jew. Nobody wants an Irish guy either.
*  Nobody wants a guy that looks like me whose name is Maliki.
*  What about Kennedy?
*  Nobody wants that.
*  Get an Asian or a Jew, please.
*  What about Kennedy?
*  Nobody wants ... you want a doctor or an Indian guy, like a Pakistani guy, something?
*  Indians.
*  Listen to him. Listen to the Italian guy.
*  I like what you're saying.
*  What it is. I think that's fair.
*  I like when people are racist against white people. It's like clearing.
*  It's clean. You can get away with it.
*  It's all we have left.
*  Yeah. You get away with it.
*  You get away with it.
*  Yeah. Shit all over them.
*  All you have left. And Italians are barely white.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  Truly.
*  That's my people.
*  So we're Irish. We're barely white.
*  Well, we were slaves.
*  We were slaves.
*  The potato famine was a tragedy.
*  People tend not to remember that.
*  Oh, they gloss over at these folks and they eat potatoes right in front of you.
*  Yeah.
*  They don't even think about you.
*  This was a hard time.
*  But I don't know. This debate tomorrow is going to be like ...
*  It might be the funnest thing ever.
*  I hope ...
*  And the scariest thing.
*  I hope it falls apart.
*  I hope Biden forgets what he's talking about and just falls asleep.
*  I hope Trump goes crazy and starts making shit up.
*  Yeah.
*  And I hope the United States the next day puts time out.
*  And stop.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's start over.
*  It's an hour and a half commercial free.
*  It's an hour and a half commercial free.
*  Wow.
*  Who's the moderator? Chris Wallace?
*  I don't ... Let me see. I know they've announced all three.
*  I think it's Chris Wallace.
*  It's a TikTokker.
*  Let me tell you something about that Chris Wallace guy.
*  He is very reasonable.
*  He's not bad.
*  He's very reasonable. He's a good choice.
*  He will hold your fucking nuts to the fire if you say stupid shit.
*  Yeah. He's good.
*  Yeah.
*  He's good.
*  And he's a Fox News guy, but he's ...
*  He's good.
*  And even liberals are looking at him and they're like, okay.
*  It's going to be a really crazy debate.
*  I'm kind of ... I mean, I'm doing the show instead of ...
*  But I'll watch it. And I'm sure it'll be ...
*  Well, you can always watch it afterwards.
*  It's going to be available.
*  It's just going to be around.
*  The election is what's scary to me.
*  We should do ... Last year or last ... In 2016, you weren't in LA yet, but we did a End of the World podcast.
*  Yeah.
*  We should do something like that on November 3rd.
*  That'd be hilarious.
*  We should get some people in here. Jamie.
*  Sure.
*  Who do we have on ... Do we have anybody booked?
*  Hold on. Don't tell me who it was.
*  Don't say anything. Don't say anything.
*  Nothing. There's nothing that works.
*  Don't say anything, Jamie. There might be.
*  That I know of.
*  Okay. It just says election. Damn it.
*  You have different knowledge than me.
*  Don't let the fucking Spotify people know. I got to keep the guests quiet so I can sneak them in.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, by the way, I'm sneaking some people in.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, there's going to be some nuclear bombs we're going to drop.
*  Yeah.
*  But yeah, let's do that. Let's get together a few guys, like maybe Normand.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe Shafir.
*  Yeah, why not?
*  Some crazy people.
*  Yeah.
*  Do it all in here and do it live.
*  Why not? Skype options might be available too if someone can't make it.
*  We might not be in this room anymore by then.
*  I got ideas, motherfucker.
*  You're moving on.
*  I'm doing shit.
*  I'll take this, studio, when you're done. I'll take this.
*  Well, you want to move here, right?
*  I might. Yeah. I mean, it's getting a little crazy over there.
*  Listen, if you move here, I might have this available for you.
*  Getting a little crazy over there.
*  Yeah, good internet.
*  You know?
*  If you're into red and black, this is your spot.
*  Yeah, this is the spot. I like it. This is like a Boston Chinese restaurant.
*  I had to put this thing together. I mean, I didn't put it together, but Matt Alvarez did.
*  More red.
*  Yeah, we can make it more red.
*  Yeah.
*  We had to put this thing together.
*  I literally decided from... I like that. Leave it like that.
*  Leave it like that. That's great.
*  That's tight.
*  This is nice.
*  Yeah, it's tight. From deciding we were going to leave LA to living here for six weeks.
*  It's quick.
*  Six weeks.
*  Quick.
*  We were from deciding we were going to leave LA to shipping everybody, moving the whole crew,
*  like everybody, security people, Jamie, my family.
*  Fucking... we had to move all the equipment. We had to set everything up.
*  They had to put together this fucking room.
*  People are like, I fucking hate this new studio.
*  It's a spot where I talk.
*  What do you give a fuck what's behind me?
*  Yeah, yeah. But I got plans.
*  Yeah.
*  I got plans for stage two.
*  Well, I liked the way you addressed it the other day. You said, folks, relax.
*  Settle down.
*  Settle down.
*  It's not the most important thing.
*  It'll all be okay.
*  It's like there's a thing. These are sound panels.
*  Yeah.
*  I just thought they looked cool.
*  Well, I appreciate that. And thanks for letting me use your backyard for my pop-up show.
*  Whenever you want. Just tell everybody where I live.
*  I was like, are there any clubs open?
*  That's fine.
*  I don't think so. I'm like, I'll just bring everyone to the backyard.
*  Just get 100 people in the backyard for you.
*  Yeah.
*  I'll just clear it off real quick.
*  Yeah.
*  I think there's going to be... I mean, there's a Velveeta room here.
*  Yeah, it's a great spot.
*  Are they still doing stand-up now?
*  I don't know what's going on. I think a lot of stuff is Austin has closed.
*  The whole 6th Street was sketched the other day. I drove down 6th Street during the day
*  and I was like, whoa, this looks sketchy.
*  Nothing looks good right now because...
*  Everything's closed up and weird.
*  At night it opens up.
*  Does it?
*  I hear music at night downtown.
*  Well, I heard music for sure, but I also saw a lot of very homeless-y looking folk
*  wandering around.
*  Yeah. Well, that's going to get worse and worse unless people figure out a way to get
*  people back to work and get people mental health care and get people all kinds of shit.
*  Bridget Phetasy sent me a video that she took from Venice.
*  It's bananas.
*  What's going on?
*  A mile straight. I mean, a mile straight of tents.
*  The fucking video just keeps going and going and going and you're like, no, no, that can't be.
*  Hold on.
*  It's like, why are there no tents in Beverly Hills though?
*  Because there's people with a lot of money there.
*  Right. That's exactly what it is.
*  But then they tweet on Twitter about...
*  Well, the Venice people are like...
*  They have this stupid idea of what's okay.
*  The Venice people think it's fine.
*  It's fine. Look at this. Watch this.
*  Can you watch? See that, ladies and gentlemen?
*  Yeah, this is crazy. This is crazy.
*  Look how long this goes. I'll send this to you, Jamie.
*  I'll air drop it to you because people need to see this because a lot of people think,
*  oh, you're exaggerating.
*  It's not that big a deal.
*  No, it's bad.
*  It's not that big a deal.
*  Here, young Jamie. It's on the way to you.
*  See that?
*  It's not good.
*  It's a fairly long video.
*  It's sent already?
*  This is the thing that Android's missing. Air drop.
*  They can eat shit. As long as there's air drop
*  and as long as Apple's better with privacy, they can eat shit.
*  You can't put it up there?
*  Check this out. Watch this.
*  Let's watch how long this is.
*  This is like a minute long video.
*  And watch. Here we go.
*  I'm not exaggerating.
*  It goes on and on and on and on and on and on.
*  And you fast forward. It keeps going.
*  It keeps going.
*  Like, this is a long fucking video.
*  It's more than a minute long.
*  And it's just all tense.
*  It's crazy.
*  And that's just some of it.
*  That's just some of it.
*  Yeah, there's real bad problems and there's no good ways to solve them right now.
*  Nobody knows how to fit.
*  Well, they're doing this dumb shit like putting boulders under the things.
*  And you can't do that.
*  You're just going to make them move and then they're going to be somewhere else with a tent.
*  I guess you fix it with mental health care.
*  The problem is they keep trying to build this low cost housing,
*  but I think it's like $740,000 per unit of low cost housing.
*  I was like, why is it costing that much?
*  There's so much regulation and red tape.
*  They won't let them do drugs there, so they leave.
*  And if you don't make it illegal for them to just have tents on fucking sidewalks
*  where you can't walk around, you got to walk on the highway because there's fucking tents everywhere.
*  What about mental health care?
*  But that's still a long play.
*  That's not going to fix anything overnight.
*  Would you say shoot them, kill them?
*  Is that what you just said?
*  Well, a mental health care clinic that they would walk into thinking it's a clinic and then you
*  would vaporize it.
*  I don't know what's going to fix it.
*  I don't know either.
*  I think it's one of those things where it got too far.
*  It's too far gone.
*  They didn't have a few tents and they said, hey folks, what's wrong?
*  Can we help?
*  Let's put together a program to help these people.
*  And then COVID came along and everything magnified by 10.
*  Yeah, the system seems to be buckling in certain places, and that's one of the places
*  it seems to be buckling the most noticeably is in Los Angeles.
*  And the people with money are just like, fuck this.
*  People with money are out of it.
*  They're just completely, I suppose in Hamptons, I spoke to some guy in Hamptons,
*  he had no idea what was going on.
*  He said to me, he's like, aren't all these problems on Twitter?
*  Are these real problems?
*  I'm like, no, they're real problems, but they're out.
*  They're out to lunch.
*  People that are just insulated by their own social circle or wherever they are.
*  But I mean, these problems, whether it's the fires, the economy, the homeless people,
*  it's a perfect storm.
*  And Los Angeles is just in deep, deep trouble and they're not opening up anytime soon.
*  It seems so poorly managed.
*  It's very poorly managed.
*  I didn't realize how important it is to have a good mayor until I saw this shit happen
*  and a good governor.
*  Well, if you want to feel better about Los Angeles, go right over to New York City and
*  Bill de Blasio has destroyed 15 years of progress in five months.
*  It really has.
*  Yeah.
*  It's crazy.
*  Absolutely.
*  It's crazy.
*  That city right now at night does not feel fun to walk around in.
*  Yeah, tell me what it was like.
*  Well, it was weird.
*  We had an Airbnb.
*  Me and the dude who opens for me, we had an Airbnb.
*  Beautiful apartment on like, but it was in Hell's Kitchen right by Times Square.
*  But we were in one of those high rises.
*  I said, we're all the way up.
*  And then the Uber, we got in an Uber that was a hazmat.
*  It was wrapped in, literally ducked.
*  The guy was in a hazmat suit in the Uber.
*  The Uber was cellophane wrapped, like the partition.
*  It was from 12 Monkeys.
*  Remember that movie?
*  Yeah.
*  That's exactly what it was from.
*  And then he dropped us off two blocks from the Uber and he had a camera.
*  We're filming stuff.
*  And the walk from the Uber to the apartment was, I never felt that way in New York.
*  I mean, it was pretty wild.
*  You were looking at stuff and you were going like, this is teetering on a real big problem.
*  There's just people out in the streets now.
*  If you were a tourist, you would not be, yeah, that's our Uber driver.
*  If you were a tourist or if you were somebody visiting the city,
*  it would not be a place you would feel comfortable or safe.
*  And they defunded the police by like a hundred million dollars.
*  Yeah, they're taking money away and they're going to have less cops.
*  And then instead of trying to figure out and solve some of these problems,
*  they're just trying to like, again, they want to win on Twitter.
*  They want to win the war on Twitter, right?
*  It's like, that's what Hillary Clinton, she tried to win the election on Twitter.
*  That was a big thing.
*  Like the thing is even the progressives are attacking de Blasio.
*  Well, they hate him too.
*  I mean, he's across the board.
*  Incompetent.
*  He eats pizza with a fork.
*  Yes.
*  And nobody trusts him.
*  And he's just, he's an empty headed goon.
*  Yeah. That's a good way to describe it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. There's no de Blasio fans now.
*  It's a dark time for New York City and I don't know how it bounces back.
*  I don't know who's right.
*  James Altucher or Jerry Seinfeld, but that was amusing.
*  They're both wrong because neither one of them are living in New York City.
*  So Jerry Seinfeld has a trillion dollar home in the Hampton and James Altucher is in Florida
*  selling God only knows survivalist kits out of his basement.
*  And I like him, but you know, I think it just ebbs and flows.
*  I think it's a cycle.
*  I think you're in for some years of darkness.
*  Ari likes it.
*  Good. The artists are going to move in.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Who are the artists Ari?
*  New York City needs to be gritty.
*  Yeah. Who are the artists? The Tik Tokers?
*  Tik Tokers are moving in.
*  They're going to take over.
*  Yeah. That's what we need.
*  We need punk rockers.
*  Yeah. I think that's possible that it happens in a few years.
*  Things get bad.
*  Lower the rents.
*  Right. Lower the rents. The artists come in, you know, people.
*  And then maybe, you know, listen, then you see like architects start taking big chances again
*  because the rents are cheaper.
*  They start building cool buildings, reinventing public spaces.
*  There's some type of Renaissance.
*  I mean, look after World War II, we had a real big boom in the 50s.
*  They're going to need a Giuliani.
*  Well, they're going to need somebody.
*  They're going to need someone like that.
*  They're going to need somebody.
*  And so is LA. LA is going to need some guy who comes in and puts his fucking foot down.
*  And it'll have to get really bad before that.
*  You know, when Giuliani got elected, I think it was in 1990, there was like 29 or 3000 homicides
*  in Manhattan.
*  That's a big difference. 29 or 3000.
*  No, it was 2900 or 3000.
*  But it was literally, it was almost 3000 homicides.
*  And then we got it down to like 400 or 500 a year.
*  That's a massive difference in the amount of people getting killed.
*  Forget maimed and shot and all these other crimes.
*  Well, the feeling of Times Square, I remember it from back in those days.
*  It was weird.
*  Yeah.
*  You'd be like, this place is sketchy.
*  Like, let's get out of here.
*  Now it's like, it was like a mall.
*  And Giuliani, because he did a great job, but he because he's kind of a little bit of a cretin
*  and a lot of people forgot how bad it was.
*  They don't, they don't give him any of the credit for that.
*  They say all the credits to go to somebody else.
*  But the reality was it was a lot of the new initiatives that he kind of brought forward.
*  Well, here's the thing.
*  As much as you like to think progressively and be a person who's open minded and that's who I am.
*  Yeah.
*  You need law and order.
*  You do.
*  You need a civilization.
*  You fucking need it.
*  You need a society.
*  We need a society.
*  You need punishment for people to break those rules.
*  We need to have a society.
*  Otherwise, we have nothing else.
*  That's why the amount of people that glorify or excuse random acts of violence against people
*  and private property in the pursuit of a political aim to me is the crazy.
*  That is a single craziest development in my life.
*  I'm 35 that I've seen that the media and even political figures
*  excuse random violence against innocent people and their property
*  in service of an overall political point.
*  That is crazy.
*  CNN.
*  Chris Cuomo.
*  Yeah.
*  Since when does a protest have to be peaceful?
*  That's crazy.
*  That is a crazy thing to say.
*  Do you think that someone scripts that for him?
*  Someone says that.
*  No.
*  How does that work?
*  I don't know, but I don't think it's scripted.
*  I think he has a mind virus.
*  I think he's sick.
*  I think they're all sick and something's eating their brains.
*  Maybe drop one of those other founders.
*  I think they all think that when the revolution or whatever happens,
*  they want to be this.
*  I want to be the good white guy who said, go out there and burn it all down.
*  I'm your friend.
*  Remember me?
*  Even though I'm a rich white guy and you don't like them,
*  I told you to burn it down.
*  We're good, right?
*  We're not.
*  They're going to get you too.
*  You're their enemy too, dummy.
*  You know what they are?
*  You remember that video where there's these kids in the house
*  and they're watching these people march by and they give them the thumbs up.
*  People start throwing rocks at the window.
*  But we agree with you.
*  Hey, I'm on your side.
*  That's exactly what when you unleash chaos, you're inviting chaos.
*  There's no way to contain it.
*  I think the comas of the world and all of those people are trying to marshal
*  the forces that they're opening up.
*  A comedian friend of mine, Giannis Pappas, said it.
*  He goes, they're opening up the gates of hell.
*  They're opening up the gates of hell.
*  And then they're trying to instruct everybody where to go
*  and how bad the fires are going to get.
*  And it's like, dude, when you open up those gates,
*  you have no idea what's going to happen.
*  November 3rd.
*  We'll talk.
*  Let's go.
*  Let's make it happen.
*  Let's go!
*  Tim Dillon, ladies and gentlemen.
*  Thank you.
*  Follow him on Twitter and the Instagram.
*  What is it?
*  Tim J. Dillon on the Instagram?
*  Tim J. Dillon, D-I-L-L-O-N on Instagram and Twitter,
*  where I think we should all be spending more time.
*  Woo!
*  Thanks, brother.
*  Appreciate you.
*  Bye, everybody.
