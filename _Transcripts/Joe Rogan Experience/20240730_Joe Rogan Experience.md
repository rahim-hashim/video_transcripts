# Joe Rogan Experience #2182 - Michael Malice
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [July 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3fA-zGu-EU)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day.
*  I have to announce, because Netflix is making me announce this,
*  that I have a Netflix special that's live Saturday night from San Antonio.
*  Oh.
*  So it's going to be live all over the world.
*  I'm going to see you tomorrow.
*  Oh yay. Oh yeah, we're coming.
*  Yeah, yeah. It's going to be a lot of fun.
*  I've seen your set. It's really funny.
*  It's tight now. It's good. It's like I'm very happy with it.
*  How long has it been since you dropped the special?
*  Six years.
*  Wait, seriously?
*  Yeah, I was ready to do one in August of 2020 when the shit went down.
*  So when the shit went down with the COVID stuff, I was preparing.
*  So that was like March, right? I was preparing to do one in August.
*  And then I didn't do stand-up for like eight months.
*  And then we started doing stand-up out here again.
*  And then I started changing a lot of bits and moving stuff around.
*  And I'm like, I'm going to do one right now.
*  And I sort of just really enjoyed fucking around and just doing comedy for doing comedy, you know,
*  and then doing it at the club.
*  And when the club opened, it was just so much fun.
*  It was just, it's just such a fucking joy to be there all the time.
*  It's like I get anxious to get back there. Like, I can't wait.
*  I was there opening night.
*  Yeah.
*  And I was there with my protege Trey.
*  We're in the green room and I'm very much like, okay, this isn't your house.
*  Like, be respectful of the space, you know, because I'm not a comic.
*  Tim Dillon's there who I'm pals with. Ron White. Oh my God, Ron White.
*  Tony, you know, the crew.
*  And then I hear the voice and Rosanne walks in.
*  Right. And I'm like, oh, fucking shit.
*  And I'm like, all right, keep it cool.
*  And I hear her say, yeah, when you get to be my age, you either have diarrhea or you're constipated.
*  So when I was on Tucker Carlson, my son's like, Mom, you've never been more personable.
*  I go, yeah, that's because I shit myself.
*  And I'm sitting there. I'm like, okay, here's your opening.
*  And I go, you stole that line from the president.
*  And she goes, what? No, who said, like her head's still looking around.
*  And then I'm talking to her.
*  She didn't know you.
*  Of course she didn't know me. You know, she's a boomer. Right.
*  So I'm sitting there.
*  And the thing is, look, you hang out with like part of your act.
*  You hang out with Elon. You hang out with like these major figures.
*  Who do I get? I'm like the Make-A-Wish kid who's got a cold.
*  And they're like, we can get you Dave Smith, maybe Lex Friedman. Right.
*  So I'm chatting with her and she's going on about how there's the book of Esther,
*  which is a Jewish story from the Old Testament, the story of Purim, which I learned when I was in Yeshiva.
*  And she's going on about Vashti's one of the characters is trans and she's got a dick.
*  And they didn't teach us this in school. I assure you.
*  She's like, you didn't know Vashti was trans. And I'm sitting there.
*  I'm trying to keep up with her. I don't know what the hell she's talking about.
*  She's off the rails.
*  But the whole time I'm like, holy shit, Roseanne is yelling at me.
*  One of my favorite videos from the store, you find it on my Instagram, Jamie of Roseanne dancing.
*  She's smoking a cigarette and dancing while the get it together bitch sign is illuminated in the background.
*  It's such a fucking great video.
*  I've been hanging out with her and it's like one of the greatest things that ever happened.
*  Oh, she's such a character.
*  Yeah, because the thing is, if I make her laugh, it's like the show.
*  But if I don't make her laugh and she yells at me, well, Roseanne's yelling at me, which is also a win.
*  She believes some crazy stuff, but she's open to be informed.
*  Yes, we tell her that this is actually what's good. She doesn't like dig her heels in.
*  Like she I try to explain to her contrails. Yeah, that they probably do spray things in the air.
*  Sure. It probably does happen. But that's not what you're seeing all the time.
*  What you're seeing all the time is a hot jet engine.
*  That's counting and counting condensation. It literally creates clouds.
*  It's a physical effect. You can recreate it over and over and over again.
*  That doesn't mean that people don't spray shit in the sky.
*  And it doesn't mean that they haven't experimented with things because they're already talking to you about experimenting with weather modification.
*  First of all, they have some data and one of the some data that they have is actually from 9 11 because of the contrails.
*  So the contrails, when they stop being a thing because they shut the entire air travel system down in the United States for how long was it?
*  A couple of days. Yeah, it was more than that. Yeah, it might have been a week.
*  How long it was a law. It was a while.
*  So what happened was the Earth's temperature actually increased.
*  The temperature in the United States increased by a measurable amount.
*  Right. So it's very small, but it's measurable.
*  And it's because there's no clouds. So those clouds that those planes create by flying overhead all the time, those things are consistently blocking out the sun to the point where it actually changes the temperature of the Earth.
*  So one of the things they found out about boat travel, you know, shipping containers, these gigantic ships when NATO imposed two days, two days.
*  Yeah. So when they impose new and I don't know who's NATO, whoever it was, impose new environmental restrictions on these giant cargo ships, once they did that, they found that the surface temperature of the ocean actually increased because they weren't blowing
*  pollution over the ocean so much so that it creates like a foggy haze that actually measurably blocks the amount of sunlight that goes through it.
*  So ironically, like in trying to cool the ocean by decreasing our carbon footprint, they actually increase the surface temperature of the ocean.
*  That also gets to the whole thing about how it's not necessarily a bad thing if temperature increases because there's more life at the equator than at the poles.
*  And it's not necessarily bad if you're going to get things slightly warmer and maybe it's the speed that's the issue, but they never even take that into consideration.
*  As long as there's any change, it can only be for the worse.
*  Well, it's also a business. This is where we have to be really careful with this stuff because I'm very environmentally conscious.
*  I love wilderness and Earth and the ocean. I love all these things.
*  There's a bunch of things that we should address as human beings.
*  The biggest one, unfortunately, is that we've decimated all fish life in the ocean somewhere in the neighborhood of 94 percent.
*  Is that what it is? What's the number of 94? I think it's 94 percent of all big fish are missing from the ocean.
*  The differences between the numbers of 100 years ago versus today, it's down 94 percent.
*  Wait, hold on. What do you mean by big fish? Do you mean like whale sharks?
*  No, no, no, like tuna fish that we eat.
*  All the swordfish, all these different fish that we commercially capture.
*  Those things are decimated. Just decimated. It's a fucking disaster.
*  And it's not a lot of these...
*  90 percent.
*  Wow.
*  90 percent of larger fish in the ocean are gone. We take through overfishing, unsustainable overfishing.
*  So the real fear is that if we keep going like this for another 100 years, there's nothing left.
*  And it's very difficult to impose these restrictions on these boats that are in the middle of the ocean that are from other countries.
*  Well, the other issue is bycatch, where you're killing a lot of things that you didn't really want to have captured.
*  And also, if you remove the predators, then the prey explode in population, like with deer.
*  And then everyone's front lawn. That does a whole cascade effect there.
*  That 90 percent number seems... because how would they have had that data 100 years ago, though?
*  Well, fish markets.
*  So if you talk to anybody who's a sushi chef that's ever been to the famous fish markets in Tokyo, they're so amazing that I was only in Tokyo for two days.
*  I had just flown in. We did the weigh-ins. I was out of it.
*  I was like, God, I should get up at five in the morning and go to the fish market. And I didn't do it. I'm fucking kicking myself.
*  It's supposed to be incredible.
*  I was just there.
*  I came here to yell at you.
*  Oh, no, I'm not even kidding. No, no, no.
*  Like, you know the guy who goes to Japan once and is like, you got to go to Japan? That's me.
*  I've been to Japan. Unfortunately, I was there very briefly.
*  But that's not going to Japan.
*  Yeah, it was beautiful, though. I loved it. I loved the audience.
*  The audience at the fights were so respectful and they were so knowledgeable.
*  Like if someone passed guard, everyone would clap. I was like, wow, this is wild.
*  I was really angry at all the misconceptions that I was taught about Japan and Japanese people.
*  Like I thought that everyone would be like a robot.
*  They were great sense of humor, very friendly.
*  And the thing that they have there that we don't have here is like everyone really takes pride in what they do.
*  And like you see it in just regular stores and things like that, restaurants.
*  Like they love their country.
*  Do you know who Sakuraba is?
*  Isn't he a fighter?
*  Yes, legendary fighter who used to smoke cigarettes and drink constantly.
*  And he beat everybody. He was like one of the greatest of all time.
*  He's an incredible, incredible fighter and mostly fought people way bigger than him, way bigger than him.
*  He fought a lot of absolute killers.
*  And he is like one of the funniest guys like in all of combat sports.
*  He's always like got this great sense of humor. He's always joking around with people.
*  There's all these videos of him joking around with fighters.
*  He's a sweetheart of a guy and he's Japanese.
*  Yeah, I went to Numazu, which is this little port town.
*  And it looked like something that a Lovecraft because it's clearly declining.
*  So you go down the main street all the way to the ocean and everything's the sea rather.
*  Everything is closed all boarded up because that's the world's only deep sea aquarium.
*  And I'm into that very much.
*  And I'm like, all right, we got to go to Numazu when we're there.
*  How do they do it? How's a deep sea aquarium work?
*  How deep does water get?
*  Well, the thing is the fish, I guess they're caught by catch because the issue is the pressure.
*  You bring them up, their eyes explode, their stomachs explode.
*  I don't know how they had the things that they had in those tanks.
*  The tanks are not pressurized. It's not possible.
*  But they had a lot of insanely cool shit there.
*  So do the fish adapt, do you think?
*  Maybe these are fish that...
*  But no, the batfish are like don't... some fish vertically migrate, right?
*  Have you ever been to the one that's in the Mandalay Bay in Vegas?
*  No, I don't think I have.
*  Fucking incredible.
*  But it's not like this.
*  This is the only one.
*  This is the only one on Earth.
*  There's the one in Mandalay Bay, it's sharks.
*  Holy shit, look at that thing.
*  That's a coelacanth.
*  Yeah, that's the one that they thought was extinct.
*  Right, for what, 65 million years.
*  So it's just an amazing, amazing place.
*  And the thing is right around the corner...
*  God, how cool is that?
*  It was so cool.
*  What a cool fish that is.
*  That is an old ass fish.
*  That fish is from like the beginning of life.
*  And they've got lobed fins.
*  There's only two fish that still have lobed fins.
*  What does that mean?
*  You can see how there's like an arc, like the fin doesn't...
*  Like a, oh, it has bones that stick out.
*  Yeah, the fin doesn't attach directly to the body.
*  There's like a lobe.
*  So them and lungfish are the only ones who have that anymore.
*  Coelacanth, I think it has bones in there because, you know,
*  there's a lot of these animals...
*  One of the weirdest ones is like there was an animal that became a whale,
*  and it was a land animal.
*  Right.
*  You know about that one?
*  Of course, it was like a hippo kind of thing.
*  Yeah, weird fucking looking thing.
*  And that thing became a whale.
*  And it was a carnivore.
*  Yeah, well, whales are carnivores.
*  I know, which is nuts, right?
*  But they kind of are.
*  They're sweet about it.
*  They only eat the little bitch ass creatures.
*  Not the sperm whales.
*  What do they eat?
*  Giant squid.
*  Do they? Oh, that's right.
*  And they shoot sonic waves and like boil the water.
*  What?
*  Yeah, sperm whales...
*  Sonic waves and they boil the water, really?
*  Like a sperm whale can kill you by just vibrating.
*  Like there was a diver who was with him and they can fuck you up really bad.
*  Wow, no shit.
*  Oh yeah, because they're like what, 80 feet?
*  They're huge.
*  And their entire bulbous nose is to have this...
*  Yeah, there you go.
*  Whoa, acoustic prey debilitation hypothesis or the Big Bang Theory.
*  The theory states that sperm whales can produce ultrasonic noises that are too high in frequency for humans to hear
*  and that these sounds can create shock waves that could injure prey.
*  However, some studies have not found evidence to support this theory.
*  There was a diver...
*  Can you show more so we can find out?
*  There was a diver who had it happen.
*  Like this was part of Blue Planet or one of those BBC shows.
*  Well, I mean, it kind of makes sense.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, especially when you look at the size of their mouth and the noises they make.
*  Sperm whales can reach up to 200...
*  How cool is that?
*  I have a sperm whale tooth for my shaving brush.
*  And how wild is that?
*  That fucking thing breathes air.
*  And that thing used to be on land and it's like, eh, I'm going to go hang out here and change everything.
*  There is that meme about the fish went to the land and you evolved to go back to the sea,
*  but you're not as good as you were before because you don't have gills.
*  Then you become a penguin.
*  It's a whole...
*  You can't do it either.
*  It's a whole thing.
*  No, but it's...
*  So the thing I want to talk about, Numazu, there was this little sushi place that I spent 15 minutes looking up this place
*  because I want to give the guy a shout out called Iriichi.
*  I-R-I-I-C-H-I.
*  It's in Japanese in Google Maps.
*  And it's just a dude and two tables.
*  And he's been there for 30 years.
*  And he goes to the fish market.
*  He marinades the fish.
*  It was one of the best experiences of my life, but they were having so much fun.
*  The waitress, you know, this...
*  It's like him and the waitress.
*  And she goes...
*  And she's got her like broken English.
*  She goes, every morning he goes to fish market, serious face, serious face, and picks out the fish.
*  And he was delighted to be like, try my food.
*  Like he puts joy into his work.
*  Yeah.
*  You saw Jiro dreams of sushi, right?
*  Well, I put in my phone, I like you better than Jiro.
*  And he lost it.
*  Well, Jiro is probably like the guy now where all the other like sort of incognito sushi places that are legendary.
*  They're like, hey, what the fuck?
*  I think Jiro...
*  The thing Jiro seems like it wouldn't be fun.
*  It feels like you're taking a test.
*  Because he's so serious about it.
*  Because he's so serious.
*  Yeah.
*  I know what you're saying.
*  So this guy was more fun.
*  Yeah.
*  And the thing I found is a lot of these high end places, you know this better than I do, they're not all stuffy.
*  A lot of times they know how to have a good time.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Do you know Wagyu Mafia?
*  Where's that?
*  No.
*  Okay.
*  Wagyu Mafia is a Tokyo establishment and they did a pop in in Austin at Pasta Bar.
*  So Pasta Bar, do you know Philip Franklin Lee?
*  He's the guy that owned sushi.
*  He started here with Sushi Bar.
*  And then he became...
*  He branched out into his own thing, which is sushi by scratch.
*  And he also does this other thing in town called Pasta Bar.
*  And at Pasta Bar they brought in this Wagyu Mafia guy.
*  And they like put on a fucking show.
*  Like this is...
*  But it's fun.
*  Look, they're smiling, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Everyone's having a good time.
*  Oh my god, it was so fun.
*  It was so silly.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, everything was silly.
*  They feed you sometimes.
*  And it's like they blow gold dust over the air.
*  It's not stuffy at all.
*  So he's like the complete opposite of Jiro dreams of sushi.
*  But insane experience.
*  But Jiro is not what Japan...
*  I thought Japan wasn't going to be like Jiro and it wasn't.
*  And I'm really...
*  Dude's making swords.
*  Like if I don't like the food he just stabs himself in the stomach.
*  No, but like dudes fucking hammering out swords.
*  That's what I think about.
*  You think about like the craftsmanship and the seriousness.
*  But like the economics of the place, I don't understand.
*  Because they have these big like office buildings like in Harold Square in New York.
*  And it'll be like 13 floors.
*  And each floor has like six rooms.
*  And you can take an elevator and it's a guy, no windows, two tables and a bar.
*  And I grew up on like role playing games.
*  It's like the guy in the armor shop.
*  Like he's always there.
*  Like I don't know what his life is.
*  But he takes pride in his cocktails.
*  There's just room for five people.
*  I don't know how he stays in business, but there's hundreds of them.
*  And it's so...
*  Everyone's...
*  The thing that angered me as a former New Yorker, you're out at night.
*  Everyone's out in the streets.
*  Everyone's plastered.
*  Everyone's having fun and it's perfectly safe.
*  So when you look at New York and San Fran and LA, this is completely on purpose.
*  Like it does not have to be this way.
*  It was such a great time.
*  Is it on purpose or is it neglect that no one steps in to correct?
*  If you're arresting someone 30 times and putting him back on the street, like that's on purpose.
*  Right.
*  But that's the officer that's doing that.
*  No, it's not the officer.
*  It's the police department and the prosecutor and the district attorney.
*  But then there's the politicians that are like in control of these areas.
*  And then there's a tone that these areas have that's being controlled by the district attorney.
*  By how they prosecute things.
*  And all this is all very, very political.
*  So that part of the part...
*  That's the part that made it looks like you guys want it to be like this.
*  Because you're not course correcting at all.
*  At all.
*  I feel like at this stage it's gotten...
*  It's so pervasive.
*  Like the places where there's crime and violence are so bad and they've been that way for so fucking long.
*  Like it would take a monumental effort that we just aren't capable of doing.
*  Like we don't have $175 billion to fix all...
*  Oh, wait a minute.
*  We just gave all that money to Ukraine.
*  Oh wait, we could have fixed it.
*  Yes, very easily.
*  That's the dumbest part of the argument.
*  We don't have the resources for it.
*  But we have all these resources for all these other things.
*  And it's a small percent of people causing all the problems.
*  Like a Pareto effect was like 20% of people cause 80% of the problems.
*  It's not like everyone in New York is a criminal.
*  No, no.
*  It's a lot of career criminals in New York.
*  A lot of people that do the break-ins in the cars and stuff like that, they get arrested all the time.
*  Well, what was that guy Jordan Ealy who like tried to kidnap a girl.
*  He punched an old lady in the face for no reason.
*  Broke her orbital socket.
*  The one who was killed on the subway by that good Samaritan.
*  It's like you punch an old lady in the face and break her orbital socket for no reason once.
*  That's a wrap.
*  Yeah.
*  That guy, he was prosecuted or he's being charged.
*  Has he gone through the whole trial?
*  I don't think he has at all.
*  He should be mayor.
*  This is the guy that choked the guy to death.
*  Looks like he got him in a rear naked choke and didn't let go.
*  What was the cause of death?
*  The guy have a heart attack?
*  That's a good question.
*  Because a lot of times...
*  Rear naked is hard to kill someone.
*  You got to really hold on for a long time.
*  You got to hold on for quite a while.
*  But you can have a heart attack if someone is choking you.
*  And you'll feel it.
*  The guy will get loose.
*  You know he's out.
*  You remember the Eric Gardner case?
*  Of course.
*  That one made me sick.
*  The only person who went to jail was the photographer.
*  Oh, that's so crazy.
*  Why did he go to jail?
*  I don't remember what they got him for.
*  But the cops had barely any consequences.
*  The guy died for no reason.
*  The guy was just selling loose cigarettes.
*  Right.
*  I knew a dude who knew him.
*  It's horrific.
*  It's horrific and it's also like the guy who got him.
*  And it's also like they tried to pretend that wasn't a choke.
*  Like, come on man.
*  You know how to choke people.
*  But even if it was...
*  Why you choked him?
*  He's selling cigarettes.
*  Calm down.
*  Loose cigarettes.
*  It's nothing.
*  And it's like what is it?
*  It's interfering with the business next to it where he buys the cigarettes.
*  What are you going to do?
*  Right.
*  You know isn't there worse problems in this fucking world?
*  There's some guy who's an entrepreneur.
*  You don't have to buy the cigarettes from that guy.
*  Right.
*  And he wasn't in the store.
*  He's just selling loose cigarettes.
*  Right.
*  Like if somebody doesn't have enough money for a pack of cigarettes but they have enough
*  money for two cigarettes, this guy will sell them two cigarettes.
*  And I also think it's insane to make cigarettes more expensive on purpose to screw with poor
*  people.
*  They do?
*  That's the point.
*  Wait a minute.
*  These sin taxes, yes.
*  Oh, oh I see.
*  They want to make it really hard to buy cigarettes.
*  Well it's just they just know that people are hooked and they can just steal money from
*  you.
*  That's really what it is.
*  They know you're hooked on cigarettes.
*  No, no, no.
*  It's not the tobacco companies that are selling these prices.
*  It's the governments.
*  Right.
*  They're not going to make it as expensive as possible because the idea like Bloomberg
*  says is so it's harder for people to keep to commit to this habit.
*  Oh, that's interesting.
*  I think it's that's a nice excuse for we know they are going to keep buying cigarettes.
*  I don't think it's an excuse at all.
*  This is the guy who banned Big Gulps.
*  Do you think he banned Big Gulps because of insurance companies?
*  No, I think he banned Big Gulps because he's a goody two shoes and thinks he knows best
*  for everybody.
*  But when I hear things like that, I'm always like, OK, what's the financial incentive
*  for that?
*  Because insurance companies could be like, you know what, people are dying all the time.
*  And one of the big causes is obesity.
*  And one of the big problems with obesity is people drink like Big Gulps.
*  Like, this is why you get like this is why they made seatbelt laws.
*  They didn't make seatbelt laws to make us safe.
*  They make seatbelt laws because of insurance companies.
*  No, I thought you meant they're going to say they made seatbelt laws because fatties can't
*  fit into them to wipe out the fatties.
*  I'm like, all right, I get this eugenics thing going on here.
*  I can see it.
*  No, it's I mean, I think they're going to be able to do it.
*  I mean, I think they're trying to outlaw Big Gulps.
*  I feel like first of all, fuck you.
*  Right.
*  If I want a Big Gulp, I know it's bad for me.
*  You know, if you outlaw Big Gulp, so you don't outlaw that Dunkin Donuts blizzard thing,
*  you know that one?
*  Oh, God, what's like 1500 calories?
*  No, no, no.
*  It's probably like thousands.
*  But it's 186 grams of sugar.
*  Is that what it is?
*  What is the it's so crazy?
*  There's a dude did a YouTube video and he shows the actual sugar that's in the drink
*  It's fucking half three big backs.
*  And you think because you're drinking it, it can't be that bad.
*  It's the thing.
*  Big Macs are way better for you.
*  Yes, which is big.
*  That's fucking like grass fed meat.
*  Oh, my.
*  The thing that's insane is 14 donuts.
*  I've had how's that?
*  Like, it's so crazy.
*  Just filled it up with sugar.
*  Jamie, see if you can find the video calories.
*  It's only a thousand.
*  Does that that's not the blizzard, though, is it?
*  The blizzards, the big bad big bad boy.
*  See if you can find the video of the guy showing the sugar content in the blizzard.
*  There's a video this dude does it online.
*  I think it's the one.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  Right.
*  Look at all that fucking sugar.
*  181 grams of sugar.
*  Three quarters of a two liter bottle of coke.
*  Let's measure that.
*  Look at all this sugar.
*  Look, just imagine eating all that sugar in one session.
*  Holy fuck.
*  That's bad for you.
*  Holy fuck.
*  It's just Vulcan.
*  And dude, if you don't eat that way all the time, like I had a milkshake, like a big ass
*  chocolate milkshake.
*  I don't really do that most of the time.
*  And it was like I hit with a tranquilizer dart.
*  I was like, oh, my God.
*  Well, for me, I have a big sweet tooth.
*  But if I if I sometimes I might go on a binge and just eat bags of gummy candy, I am wired.
*  Wired for how long?
*  A while.
*  It's it's a while.
*  But you don't crash afterwards?
*  No, I go to bed.
*  I do this for if I'm binging for bed.
*  Yeah, I don't binged during the day.
*  I've heard people say that like eating a high carb meal before bed.
*  I've heard people talk about doing that.
*  They eat a high carb meal so their insulin spikes and then they just fucking crash afterwards.
*  I don't sleep issues.
*  So I feel bad people who do.
*  It's a rough thing to have, man.
*  I had honey smacks cereal and the first ingredient is sugar.
*  And I'm thinking myself like how are these being held together?
*  Because they don't look like sugar cubes.
*  It's mostly sugar.
*  It looks like grains.
*  How is that even physically possible?
*  They used to be called sugar smacks.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Sugar Bear was the name.
*  They're so good.
*  And then sugar, gold and crisp, whatever.
*  Well, we used to eat frosted flakes and then we would put sugar on the frosted flakes.
*  Oh, oh, I eat lucky charms still.
*  They're really good.
*  It's fucking good, man.
*  It's good.
*  It should be legal.
*  And you mix it with your protein drink.
*  So that way you get your protein.
*  First of all, people need access to real food primarily.
*  But every now and then a fucking blizzard from Dunkin Donuts should be on the menu.
*  If you want to, you should be able to.
*  It's ridiculous.
*  But like if you want to have a, you know what I love?
*  Tiramisu.
*  That's my favorite.
*  I fucking love it.
*  And if I'm stuffed, it's the end of the meal and they, you know, it's an Italian place and you open up the fucking tiramisu.
*  But it's also kind of crazy because like tiramisu, I love key lime pie.
*  I love key lime pie.
*  I could have like three bags of candy.
*  Like it looks like because it's cake.
*  You think, oh, it's not that bad for you.
*  It's like it's just it's insane.
*  Tiramisu, so much sugar, but it's so good.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  Oh, my God.
*  So good.
*  Those lady fingers that are dipped in espresso.
*  What about in those all those steak houses where their chocolate cake is like 1500 calories a slice?
*  And I'm like, how are you doing this mathematically?
*  American steak houses like they are trying to kill you.
*  They're trying to get you.
*  Where's the tinfoil hat?
*  They're trying to stuff you as much as possible.
*  Like if you and I mean it in the best possible way.
*  But if you go to like in town, like say if you go to Eddie V's, you go to Eddie V's and you get the lobster mashed potatoes and the real.
*  You can't stop eating.
*  You cannot stop eating.
*  They have the calorie counts at Eddie V's.
*  Do they?
*  Which is useful.
*  Well, Mike, if I don't have glasses on, I can't read that shit.
*  They make it a little tiny, tiny numbers next to the food.
*  The fuck out of here.
*  But if if you know, if you go to another country, they don't eat like us.
*  Like we eat like slobs.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, we have giant ass pizzas.
*  That's why you should go to Japan.
*  Oh, very, very, very much more discipline than I had.
*  See fat people as much.
*  I had whale eight ways.
*  Oh, wow.
*  It was really way.
*  Whoa, that's weird.
*  Apparently, whales like a poor people food there.
*  Wow.
*  But there are homies.
*  Why are you eating our homies?
*  Well, you're in Japan.
*  You know, do as the Japanese do.
*  I wonder how smart they really are.
*  People always say that whales are super smart.
*  But, you know, it's just because they can communicate.
*  And it's we have a weird definition of intelligence, right?
*  Because we really favor things that can control their environment and change their environment, like build houses and structures.
*  Not necessarily ants do that.
*  We don't think ants are smart.
*  But we do.
*  We do think they're smart.
*  No, we don't think they're smart in a weird way.
*  Well, they're skilled.
*  It's not just they're skilled.
*  They know how to make these chambers that ferment leaves.
*  And they have a like the leaf cutter ants do.
*  Yes, I was watching about them last night.
*  That's pretty creepy.
*  You brought that up.
*  Yeah, because there's a video about how did this evolve?
*  Because the fungus that's in the leaf cutter ant colony is not the same species any longer as the fungus that's outside.
*  Right.
*  So intelligence is not the right word.
*  You're right.
*  The right word is capable of incredible order.
*  And they have a pattern in their mind.
*  They follow much like bees.
*  But you don't have to teach bees how to make beehives.
*  They make beehives everywhere.
*  Right.
*  All over the fucking place.
*  So it's some it's so they're making a structure.
*  What is it?
*  There's some animal is it the puffer fish where they gave them like Ritalin or they gave them like Lexapro something and the patterns all changed.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Like they gave him some SSRI something whatever it was.
*  It changed how they like spider webs.
*  Maybe it was and it changed.
*  Oh, yes.
*  They definitely did that with spider webs.
*  I saw them.
*  There's a bunch of different things they do with spider webs and one of them they gave it LSD.
*  OK.
*  The spider was by his side.
*  I got eight legs and eight eyes.
*  He remembers when he was like a shitty shopkeeper.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  There it is.
*  Yeah.
*  There it is.
*  So normal marijuana marijuana sucks.
*  It's terrible.
*  Benz.
*  An upper Benz is I don't know what is that.
*  That's a Benzodiazepine.
*  Right.
*  Benzodiazepine is Xanax.
*  What's a Benzodrine, Jamie?
*  Caffeine caffeine caffeine is all over the place.
*  Chlorohydrate.
*  Who's getting high on chlorohydrate?
*  Chlorohydrate.
*  I have no idea.
*  What's chlorohydrate, Jamie?
*  What's Benz?
*  How weird did they pick chlorohydrate?
*  You know, why wouldn't you pick alcohol?
*  Well, you'd probably kill it, right?
*  Maybe, right?
*  OK.
*  Treat short term treatment of insomnia.
*  So is Benzodrine an upper?
*  It must be.
*  Benzos.
*  That's a thing from the 70s.
*  Well, I think that's Benzodiazepine, though.
*  I think Benzos.
*  Is it an impediment?
*  OK, yeah.
*  Benzodrine.
*  OK, yeah.
*  I don't think that's Benzos, though.
*  What is a Benzo?
*  A Benzo is an upper.
*  Is it?
*  I thought it was Xanax.
*  Because Benzo is obviously a bunch of Benzos.
*  We're like school moms.
*  Yeah, there's extra the Diazes in there.
*  Oh, the Benzos are depressants.
*  That's interesting.
*  That's the Xanax.
*  So that's Benzos when people say the term Benzos?
*  Or Downers.
*  OK.
*  What's a black beauty?
*  Because that's what they all used to take in the 70s.
*  Isn't that speed?
*  Isn't that speed?
*  I think so.
*  A lot of guys took speed and played pool.
*  It was a big thing that guys would play on amphetamines.
*  I know one time the go-gos took a bunch of Downers
*  and they had to perform sitting down on chairs.
*  Oh, that's a ledger.
*  Yeah.
*  I'll have to see how.
*  Yeah.
*  Black capsule.
*  Amphetamines, OK, uppers.
*  Yeah.
*  Extra amphetamine.
*  Yeah.
*  OK.
*  These guys who would play pool on it, they said that makes them see angles better.
*  Well, because it's like speed.
*  You see the edges.
*  It's like Ritalin.
*  I've never done Ritalin either.
*  No, but or like Adderall, excuse me.
*  I've never done Adderall.
*  Neither have I.
*  But you know, people, you're crazy focused.
*  I'm scared of that.
*  Why are you scared of focus?
*  Well, the same reason why I don't do it.
*  I've never done cocaine.
*  We've never done cocaine?
*  Ew.
*  Haven't been to Japan.
*  Haven't been done cocaine.
*  First of all, sir, cocaine is illegal.
*  Son of a bitch.
*  Second of all, uh, I'm not going to lie.
*  I think I'd like it.
*  No, you wouldn't.
*  Yeah, I'm sure I'd like it.
*  No, you wouldn't.
*  Not to the extent that people ruin their lives.
*  It's the stupidest drug.
*  Yeah, I'm not.
*  I'm not really interested in ruining my life, but I would recognize that this is probably
*  a lot of fun.
*  It's not.
*  But how come so many people say it is?
*  I don't know.
*  It's not fun at all for you.
*  It's not.
*  It's it would not be fun for you.
*  I promise you.
*  Have you ever heard the Buck Cherry song?
*  I've heard it.
*  I've heard it.
*  I've heard it.
*  I've heard it.
*  I've heard it.
*  I've heard it.
*  I've heard it.
*  I've heard it.
*  It would not be fun for you.
*  I promise you.
*  Have you ever heard the Buck Cherry song, Cocaine?
*  All lit up?
*  You know that song?
*  That song makes me want to do coke.
*  The idea of coke is a lot.
*  Let's play the song.
*  I was already on the way.
*  Okay.
*  I fucking love Buck Cherry.
*  There was a friend of mine told me a story.
*  He was in alcohol's anonymous meeting and the dude from Buck Cherry was there.
*  This model went on stage and she was telling her sober stories and she was saying, I was
*  just doing coke and just fucking all these rock stars and he goes, yeah.
*  In the middle of an AA meeting.
*  Now again, this is secondhand.
*  I don't know if this is true, but I love these guys.
*  Come on.
*  That makes me want to do blow.
*  I interviewed Belinda Carlin from the Go-Go's because she was a coke head.
*  I said, explain this to me because if it's a rock star who's a dude, he's having coke
*  orgies with all these chicks.
*  You're a girl.
*  You're not having them run train on you.
*  Literally, what would you do?
*  She said, I would go in my hotel room, take the phone off the hook, close the blinds and
*  pace like an animal.
*  I go, oh, that sounds like a lot of fun.
*  She goes, oh yeah, it was a blast.
*  What I tell you, you're not going to like it.
*  It's like giving yourself a panic attack.
*  Some people love it.
*  I know you well enough to tell you you're not going to like it.
*  Good.
*  Thank you.
*  I wasn't going to try it anyway.
*  Not even at a bucket list thing?
*  Nope.
*  For the same reason why I won't try Adderall.
*  Adderall seems much more-
*  That's different.
*  Adderall you would like.
*  That's the problem.
*  Because there's upsides.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah, the productivity part.
*  There's a lot of upsides.
*  Yeah.
*  You're like, oh shit.
*  Adderall helps you understand.
*  I've never done it.
*  Helps you understand your brain better because you see yourself like, oh, this is how my
*  brain's working and whatever.
*  Coke is just like you just wait and do more Coke.
*  And I'm not, it's just, I don't get it.
*  Expand on that.
*  So Adderall helps you know how your brain's working?
*  You know how like when you're any kind of altered consciousness, you've realized that
*  your brain has a character of its own.
*  And like most people aren't introspective and just take their thoughts for granted.
*  But people who like work with psychedelics, things like that realize, okay, there's ways
*  I can have different perceptions, different focuses, different senses of self in relation
*  to the world, things like that.
*  Adderall, from my understanding, it's like that movie Limitless is based on Adderall,
*  right?
*  I thought that was based on that other shit.
*  New Vigil?
*  Yeah.
*  Pro Vigil and New Vigil.
*  Maybe I'm wrong.
*  I don't know either.
*  Point being, when you take it, you supposedly are super focused, but you realize, okay,
*  I can fine tune like the speed of my thinking.
*  So that's fascinating that your brain has like a bike has different speeds, if I'm using
*  that metaphor correctly.
*  I just know way too many people that enjoy it on a regular basis.
*  Yeah.
*  And I had a friend who got hooked on it and she was like, this is bad.
*  It just seems to keep them going all day.
*  High achievers.
*  Right.
*  Coke doesn't do that.
*  A lot of journalists.
*  And a lot of college kids now.
*  A lot of college kids.
*  Yeah.
*  They used to be Coke kids when we were kids, now they're on Adderall.
*  I've asked friends who've done it and gone on stage, they said never again.
*  Anybody's ever like gone on stage on Adderall?
*  They're like, no.
*  Really?
*  Why?
*  Not having fun.
*  Too tense.
*  Yeah.
*  Just not like silly.
*  Not like you're loose.
*  You're wired.
*  You're clenching your jaw.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  You wouldn't like Coke.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm surprised you don't want to just try everything once.
*  What was that noise?
*  I'm busy.
*  I got a Netflix special coming up.
*  You can't try everything once because you'd be trying too many things.
*  There's not that many.
*  And then you'd have to recover of responsibilities.
*  I do think that having all these things illegal or having most of them illegal is a fucking
*  travesty.
*  I agree with you as an anarchist, but then what happened in Portland or wherever Seattle
*  it was, was a real problem.
*  Yeah, but that also coincided with terrible leadership where the mayor was saying when
*  they took over a giant swath of the city that it was the summer of love.
*  Remember that crazy shit?
*  Sure.
*  Those people were retarded.
*  The fucking philosophy up there is so stupid.
*  It's a suicide cult.
*  It's they legitimately are going to destroy their society.
*  And they're all like, yay, diversity.
*  They'll be waving their fucking pride flags as the city sinks into the ocean.
*  They're out of their fucking minds.
*  So you can't look at that place and say, this is what happens when you make drugs legal.
*  No, that's what happens when you make drugs legal in a place run by maniacs, a place run
*  by people who think it's fine to have tents everywhere and give people money to shoot
*  up and give them clean needles and give them money every month to stay homeless.
*  I hear you.
*  But my point is you and I both know a lot of people who are like way deep into psychedelics,
*  right?
*  And if psychedelics become fully legal and corporations take over, there's going to be
*  downsides.
*  I think if the corporations do the psychedelics, they'll probably have a different approach
*  to how they interact with humanity.
*  If the CEOs and all these people realize like you are going to die.
*  And if you're wasting all your time trying to squeeze as much money as humanly possible
*  at every person that interacts with your company, you're not living a harmonious life.
*  And it doesn't mean that you can't make a lot of money and sell things, but you can
*  make a lot of money and sell things with a psychedelic capitalist perspective.
*  We're not trying to do evil.
*  You're just trying to be fair about it.
*  I agree with everything you said.
*  It's not utopian, though.
*  It's not utopian.
*  But I'm saying there's plenty of people who, if they start getting on these drugs and being
*  introspective, they're not going to like what they see.
*  And there's going to be a lot of things that come up.
*  And it's not going to be an easy transition toward a better person for some of them.
*  Much harder to get a good burger.
*  It's going to quit those jobs.
*  I'm talking about like these corporate people.
*  I understand.
*  And also like even the corporate people like look what they did with Housewives and all
*  the other all the speed that they were on.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  But that's the Housewives fault.
*  They liked it too much.
*  But they were told this is a diet pill.
*  Better that or a lobotomy.
*  Like we only have a few options back then.
*  I don't think those were the two.
*  Mother's Little Helper, remember from Rolling Stone's song?
*  I mean, they stopped doing lobotomies in 67.
*  So they were doing lobotomies for like 50 fucking years, scrambling people's brains.
*  They did it to Rosemary Kennedy.
*  Didn't they do it because she was promiscuous?
*  Well, and also she was kind of slow.
*  And the thing with the lobotomy, did you know about this?
*  You have to do one the person's conscious.
*  So she had to count backwards and then she stopped being able to talk.
*  And then they pretended she's on sabbatical for 50 years.
*  And then they did the Special Olympics to kind of because they felt bad.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Evil, evil family.
*  Well, it's an evil practice that that thing that they would do for people when they had
*  troubles.
*  I love the idea.
*  It's just so insane that like there's no precision really.
*  You're stabbing them in the head, scrambling brains and hoping you hit the right spot.
*  That's not a thing.
*  I think they're going to look at that the same way they look at the way they look at
*  that now.
*  They're going to look at sex change for kids in the future.
*  Yes.
*  Oh, yes.
*  They're going to look at all this.
*  Munchausen's by proxy.
*  Also, there's a clearly like a mind virus and it is like a mind virus.
*  I mean, that term mind virus, this sounds like you shouldn't say that because a virus
*  doesn't exist in the mind.
*  It's a different kind of thing than an actual biological virus.
*  It has the same function.
*  It really does.
*  Ideas go viral.
*  Yeah, they do.
*  That's the thing.
*  Right.
*  The idea is going viral.
*  The thing is when you and I were kids as dinosaurs, every girl or 90% of them had an eating disorder
*  because she was uncomfortable with her body, is changing unwanted male attention, having
*  that sense of control.
*  It was very common.
*  Very common.
*  A lot of people didn't grow out of it, but most of them did.
*  Now, if you're uncomfortable with your body, you're going to be shifted down in this direction
*  in many cases, in many such cases.
*  Carol Markowitz, who's a journalist, she's a neighbor of mine in Brooklyn, she said a
*  majority of kids in her daughter's class were identifying as some variant of queer.
*  So she's like, I'm out of here.
*  I'm going to Florida.
*  So strange.
*  Strange isn't the word.
*  It's a, and the thing is with eating disorders, you can get over it.
*  Right.
*  This is going to cause permanent damage.
*  Did you see what this, this evil demon from the LA Times, there was a woman girl named
*  Chloe Cole, who was a detransitioner.
*  And they had this whole hit piece on her.
*  And how, oh, she's become beloved by the right.
*  It's like, this is someone telling their real, and she's not unique telling her story about
*  like, I wasn't old enough to make these decisions and I'm fucked for life.
*  I'm never going to have sexual pleasure.
*  My body's changed and I regret this enormously and I thought I wanted this and I was wrong.
*  And it's like, oh, this is just a hatchet piece.
*  I think I forgot the girl's name.
*  It's just horrible.
*  Could you imagine if it was instead the right that was promoting this, how the left would
*  react?
*  The right used to.
*  But conversion therapy, this is their version.
*  Right, praying the gay away.
*  Yeah.
*  But not as extreme in the sense that you're not doing surgery on people, especially on
*  children and giving them hormone blockers.
*  But imagine if that was the right's perspective was akin to Iran's perspective.
*  So in Iran, you have a very high number of transsexuals.
*  By law.
*  Because it's illegal to be gay.
*  Right.
*  Now imagine if that was going on with the right here.
*  They're saying, no, you can't be gay, but you can be trans and you can become a woman.
*  And so they're encouraging it and then profiting off of it and then shaming anyone that detransitions
*  like that person.
*  Imagine if that was all being done by the right.
*  People would think it's so fucking evil.
*  The thing that's also crazy is everyone who questions their gender is trans.
*  No one just has issues with their gender.
*  Not only that, there's a lot of data that shows that if you let them just leave them
*  alone and let them go through puberty and become an adult, they usually become gay.
*  And then a lot of gay people are like, hey, this is homophobic.
*  This idea is homophobic.
*  This idea that these people are actually in the wrong body.
*  Like, no, they're gay.
*  And I also talk about this a lot.
*  There's this complete insane, insane pretense that taking hormones, even the hormones of
*  your own gender has no downside.
*  So if a male takes testosterone, he's not going to have any bad side effects.
*  If a female takes estrogen, there's no bad side effects.
*  When women are pregnant and their hormones are a mess, it's all upside.
*  But they pretend that like, oh, if we just give this person hormones, it's only going
*  to be a good thing.
*  It's like, not just a huge cost.
*  But the blockers, the blockers are the crazy thing.
*  Because they are literally chemical castration drugs that they would use for pedophiles.
*  It's the same drugs.
*  But also, Joe, the lie that you can just start puberty later.
*  It's a lie.
*  Absolutely a lie.
*  You will be altered forever.
*  As I am proof, if your growth is stunted as a kid, you don't get to grow your full height
*  later.
*  There's a window.
*  Same thing with learning language.
*  These kids who are feral and raised by wolves, they don't later become scholars.
*  They lose the capacity to speak correctly.
*  So the brazen lies of, well, you could just start puberty later if that's what you feel.
*  Look at Jim.
*  Imagine this coming from the right.
*  Imagine.
*  See, this is why people are so weird.
*  And why is this politicized?
*  It's crazy.
*  It is crazy.
*  Why is it politicized?
*  If there's kids who have mental illness of some kind, let's get them help.
*  And everyone's different.
*  Right.
*  Everyone's different.
*  And the solution isn't necessarily give a girl a mastectomy when she's 14.
*  That seems insane.
*  Do you know there's a new one called Neuter?
*  And they remove, make you look like a Barbie or Ken doll.
*  Oh, God.
*  And Joe, you know why I made that, why I winced?
*  Because you know it's here in Austin.
*  The clinic is here.
*  Oh, my God.
*  This is what happens when you're friends with Deborah.
*  So you learn about these things.
*  Wait a minute.
*  Really?
*  It's called Neuter?
*  Yeah.
*  How many people have they done this to?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  It's here in Austin.
*  The guy's very proud of himself.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  God, that's so weird.
*  No, it's very normal.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Yep.
*  So this is like when you go to visit the Coliseum and you're like, what happened to these people?
*  This is us.
*  This is us.
*  It's just we're very fortunate to be in the middle of it and watching it all play out.
*  There's that meme of Jesus.
*  Yes.
*  Like, it's Matthew McConaughey's son.
*  He goes, no, he goes, flood it again.
*  Oh, that's funny.
*  I saw it, Send in the Asteroid.
*  I saw it the other day.
*  I guess there's a bunch of those.
*  Like, what the fuck, man?
*  It's when you're dealing with the thing is the gaslighting is what bothers me.
*  Well, it all bothers me.
*  It all bothers me.
*  The fragility of the human mind, you know, that we're so everybody forever was like Kamala
*  Harris is the worst vice president.
*  She's the least popular vice president of all time.
*  And then in a moment, a moment in time, all of a sudden, she's our solution.
*  She's our hero.
*  Everybody's with her.
*  All these social media posts about her.
*  Try Googling a negative story on her.
*  You won't find one.
*  So you've got me started, Officer Harris.
*  So they've been doing this live for years.
*  So in 2019, our pal Tulsi absolutely nuked her in that second debate.
*  And if you looked at charts at the time, she's kind of like Officer Harris is doing OK.
*  First of it, she comes out.
*  Joe Biden, you're a racist.
*  The Democrats were looking for an alternative to Bernie Sanders that wasn't Biden.
*  She starts going up in the polls.
*  Right. Second debate comes out.
*  Tulsi, being a good Hawaiian, knows how to roast the pig.
*  This completely slams her.
*  Not only that, she has no counterpunch.
*  She goes on Anderson Cooper and she's like, well, I'm a top tier candidate.
*  So of course, people are going to take shots at me.
*  That's her answer.
*  She immediately starts going down the polls.
*  It's that day. You can see it on the chart I have on my Twitter.
*  All the articles at the time that did an autopsy on Kamala Harris's failed campaign
*  didn't mention Tulsi once.
*  It was BBC, L.A. Times, Reuters, New Yorker.
*  A guy from The Washington Post just did a piece looking back on her campaign.
*  Didn't mention Tulsi either.
*  They completely pretend it didn't happen.
*  Well, it just shows you that what they're looking for is not what they say they're looking for.
*  Because she is a strong woman.
*  She is a person who served overseas twice in a medical unit.
*  So she got to see people blown up by the war.
*  She is a she was a congresswoman for eight years.
*  She is a person of color. She's everything you want.
*  All those things you want.
*  And yet you don't want her because she's not for war.
*  Yes. Well, she's also just not willing to play ball.
*  There's a game that's being played.
*  And if you're like, hey, you're not supposed to fucking move the ball.
*  Like, oh, look at this bitch over here.
*  Like, get out of here. You're going to fuck up our game.
*  It's not real democracy.
*  It's controlled parties.
*  Did you see that piece by Seymour Hersh that dropped over the weekend about the coup?
*  Yes. So explain to people what Seymour Hersh.
*  I don't know if he's right, but it seems to be right a lot.
*  And he was right about the Nord Stream pipeline, right?
*  What he so what I was saying and a lot of other people were saying is
*  the big issue is how do you get Biden out of the White House?
*  So here's Biden's case.
*  He's like, look, I got Trump out of the White House last time.
*  I'm only behind two or three points in the polls.
*  Kamala's polling worse than me in like eight out of 10 polls.
*  I won these delegates.
*  Why the hell should I back down?
*  And that's a very solid case.
*  Jill, for the first time in her life, people care about her.
*  She matters. As Hunter put it, I have an executive here.
*  She's a selfish, silly, entitled cunt.
*  That was how Hunter described her. Whoa.
*  Yeah, we have the text.
*  And then all the public pressure, Biden, you got to drop out.
*  Biden got dropped out. Biden got dropped out.
*  Nancy Pelosi is a gangster.
*  I wouldn't want to fuck with her.
*  I wouldn't want to fuck with Mitch McConnell.
*  These people don't mess around.
*  And everyone said or a lot of people said they're going to have to go to threats
*  because why else would he step down?
*  He's earned it, that presidency, and he's earned the nomination.
*  But if there was ever a time to invoke the 25th Amendment,
*  wouldn't you think this is the time?
*  Sure. But I don't think they then hold on. Hold on.
*  Here's the thing. Let's talk about this.
*  So Seymour Hersh, who's been around D.C. since the 60s,
*  I believe he wrote The Dark Side of Camelot, if I'm not mistaken.
*  He had a thing on his substack that goes Biden got the call
*  and it was Obama, Pelosi, former Speaker of the House, Chuck Schumer,
*  Majority Leader, Hakeem Jeffries, current House Minority Leader,
*  leader of the Democrats in the House.
*  And he said, we got Kamala on board to invoke the 25th.
*  If you don't drop the nomination, you know that's going to happen.
*  The thing is, you were saying they're not invoking the 25th.
*  He's still president. Right.
*  But I'm saying if there was a time that they were going to do that,
*  this would be that time.
*  It was that time four years ago. Right.
*  But it's been that time. But clearly now. Right.
*  More and more than ever before.
*  Why? Because it's public. No, it's deteriorating.
*  I don't think he's gotten that much worse.
*  Oh, he's gotten a lot worse.
*  There's a video that compares him from 2019 to 2024.
*  It's a market difference.
*  Yeah, but I don't think there's a big difference between 2022 and 2024.
*  There's like a two and a half hour compilation of the campaign in 2020
*  where he forgets Obama's name.
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  He he had those gaffes back then, but they're constant now.
*  He's barely hanging on.
*  I don't think he was fine this day.
*  The union, I think it's like sundowning, you know, like, OK, OK, OK.
*  You think there's a body double that was that guy walked very differently
*  than Biden, but you saw that he's a lot taller.
*  It's a Scott Adams Twitter.
*  I saw that. I'm like, am I Alex Jones in today?
*  No, he's a lot taller. Yeah.
*  No, he's physically tall. Yeah. OK. He walks way better.
*  Like as someone who like you watch Biden walk, he had a stiffness
*  that like death was coming for him.
*  And before everyone freaks out, has their mousetraps on their heads go off.
*  I think there should be more presidential body doubles
*  because one president almost got murdered.
*  So if we have ways to keep them safe, let's use them.
*  OK, that's a good thing to say.
*  We cover our ass there.
*  No. And now here's another thing to say
*  in the interest of national security.
*  Like, let's imagine a scenario where Biden is deathly ill
*  and Kamala is not really capable of taking over as president right now.
*  And there is, you know, like, who's next? Speaker of the House.
*  So Nancy Pelosi. No, who is it now? Mike Johnson.
*  Mike Johnson. Right. So that would be him next.
*  So that's a dangerous moment in terms of national security,
*  even though everyone knows that Biden's, you know, really having problems
*  and it's not actually running the show.
*  You know, I could see why they would want to use some body doubles for that.
*  Of course. You know, if the guy's in a hospital somewhere,
*  but this guy, let's let's look at it, because this guy, please play.
*  He don't walk like him.
*  He's taller than him.
*  It looks like like he gained like went back in time seven or eight years.
*  This is the weekend of Bernie's like prequel.
*  Well, this is like master gaslighting and propaganda is what it is.
*  Like to show you that there's, you know, what was it?
*  In 2000 and I forget what year it was where I believe
*  was during the Obama administration. Look at the size of this guy.
*  This isn't the clip I saw. So much bigger.
*  Look how big he is. He's so much bigger than Joe.
*  He's so much bigger.
*  Like he gained a legitimate six inches. Look how tall he looks.
*  Look at it.
*  Well, there's the French wearing heels as well.
*  Jamie, there's one on Scott Adams Twitter.
*  This is from his Twitter. Oh, but let's.
*  It's the one he's walking to the helicopter.
*  Let's watch this again. Yeah, that's another one. Yeah.
*  It's another one.
*  That's a similar one to where you see the sea one more time.
*  Let's see him walk. Walk again.
*  So look how much bigger he is than Jill.
*  Oh, he should. He towers over her.
*  He didn't use to tower over before I saw the other one.
*  And also, if you look, look, look at her, she's wearing high heels.
*  So, wow. Yeah, you see your high heels.
*  OK, and he's towering over her.
*  That is a much taller person.
*  So maybe they hooked him up with some fucking secret sauce.
*  It's going to keep him going and he'll be back.
*  Maybe they have ability to go back like biologically.
*  Oh, wow. Oh, wow.
*  Yeah. Giant, giant difference.
*  All that is that because she could be behind him.
*  So they listen. She also has high heels on, man.
*  No, no. But on the left, it could be that she's no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
*  That's a different human.
*  They look at the size difference of the torso.
*  Them walking to the helicopter is the one where it looked really.
*  Go back to that, please.
*  Look at the size differences in the torsos themselves from the top of his shoulders
*  to look at any buttons. Yeah.
*  Look at the the white of the shirt.
*  Yes. Just look at the size difference.
*  Look how much longer that human is on the left.
*  Now, it may be Biden.
*  Listen, they might have some wild shit that brings you back from the dead.
*  But like medical science is getting like there's some people out there
*  working on some wild stuff.
*  But maybe they just fucking jolted him up with some Wolverine juice.
*  Wolverine just is going to make it taller.
*  But here's the thing.
*  In the same way in the 60s, if you sat on the show and said,
*  Liberace is gay, people would yell at you because you've never seen him
*  sucking a dick. Right.
*  People right now will be like, it's impossible.
*  Why would they do a body double?
*  I don't think they would be.
*  I don't think it would be anymore.
*  You don't think so? No.
*  You don't think there's a lot of people listening right now
*  who think you're crazy? My parents.
*  Well, like regular people, no.
*  So listen, they don't.
*  But if they did, they're boobers.
*  They're full on. They're full on.
*  Listen, you got to keep Trump out of the White House.
*  This but this what you're seeing right here,
*  it really looks like a different person.
*  Now, why are we saying that?
*  Because it actually does look like a different person.
*  We're not making something up.
*  OK, I don't do that.
*  I don't pretend I don't lie.
*  I'm not a type of person that looks at something like that.
*  And like I have a propaganda thing I'm trying to push.
*  Like when people say this version of Joe Biden is the best version ever.
*  Intellectually, I'm telling you, he's on point.
*  That's not real. Right.
*  I don't do that.
*  We were also told for years that these are selectively edited clips
*  and deep fakes. That's no no, they call them cheap fakes.
*  Yeah, cheap fakes.
*  She's calling them cheap.
*  First of all, it's very expensive technology.
*  Well, a lot of money to produce the cope with the debate.
*  First, I heard people say it was the fault of the lighting.
*  I don't know what kind of lighting, unless it's some kind of space lasers.
*  After his bedtime.
*  But what kind of lighting makes you say we beat Medicare?
*  Then people said the mic was fucked up.
*  Well, if your mic is fucked up, why can't you breathe?
*  So it was amazing how all the
*  explanations didn't explain what we all saw with our eyes.
*  We can't gaslight.
*  You know, we got on.
*  I know everyone's doing this because this is how everyone's done this.
*  I don't think you can do it this way anymore.
*  I think this political gaslighting they do is genuinely bad for them,
*  not just bad for everyone and bad for the entire civilization,
*  but genuinely bad for them.
*  You can't do that anymore.
*  Because you can't just say it.
*  Everyone knows it's not everyone.
*  God, so many people do.
*  And so many people your age and my age know. Yes.
*  All right. I think everyone who like right now,
*  everyone who's 40 and under is fucking super skeptical of all that.
*  Everyone. God damn, a lot of people do a lot, but not everyone.
*  You're right. You're right. You're right.
*  I'm exaggerating.
*  But there's many more than during like my parents age.
*  Infinite. They were in their 40s.
*  Infantly more. You know, I knew social media.
*  Elon. Elon. Yes.
*  That's a big, big part. I always make this point.
*  You don't need a majority. You only need an alternative.
*  As long as there's one like that little kid who said that emperor has no clothes.
*  Yeah. As long as there's one outlet where you could be like,
*  this seems a little weird, then all of a sudden the truth can come out.
*  Or at least the good questions.
*  That dude has literally saved free speech. Yes.
*  And that sounds so stupid to some people that are against it.
*  Like, oh, my God, you think that Nazis and hate speech.
*  Listen, it's not good that people want to type racist things.
*  It's not good. It's not good that people target specific human beings.
*  It's not good.
*  It's also not good if you don't know those people exist
*  and if people can't counter those people in those comments.
*  And if people can't highlight how egregious some of the things they're saying
*  or how awful some of the things they're saying are.
*  And also get real information about like what's really going on in Venezuela,
*  what's really going on in El Salvador, everywhere.
*  And I'm also sitting here as a Jewish person, went to Jew school to tell you
*  that the idea that you can criticize George fucking Soros, who's a billionaire
*  because it's anti-Semitic.
*  Well, that's the old Mesa tactic, right?
*  What do you the the Masaad?
*  There was a guy who was a Masaad agent who talked about this,
*  like what they would do if they find out there was a journalist
*  that was saying Israel is attacking this.
*  You label him an anti-Semite.
*  Yeah, but the point is they don't do this.
*  Just anti-Semitism.
*  There was racism, there was homophobia.
*  And we're seeing it right now with George Soros.
*  No, what I'm saying is for George Soros to be anti-Semitic.
*  You're anti-Semitic. Right.
*  If you're going after Officer Harris, you're either racist or sexist or ableist.
*  So they will use...
*  Yeah, because she's a retard.
*  She's literally retarded.
*  I mean, Ukraine is a country in Europe
*  and Russia is another country and a powerful country.
*  And Russia invaded Ukraine.
*  And that's wrong.
*  What's really important is what can be unburdened by what has been.
*  I think of her as America's wine mom,
*  because bitch seems like she's three deep by noon.
*  And she's got the three phases of wine mom.
*  She's got happy drunk.
*  Oh, my God, this cereal's got a rabbit on it.
*  It's so great. Cackling, cackling, cackling.
*  Then there is trying to drunk at work
*  where you're trying to make sense, but you don't.
*  Space is around us all and unites us all and inspires us all.
*  And then there's I'm being stern so you don't realize how plastered I am.
*  And I'm making a point.
*  That little girl was me.
*  Now I'm going to go upstairs and don't knock on the door
*  because I'm going to pass out.
*  So those are her three ways she talks.
*  And those are the wine mom phases.
*  Do you think they have her medicated?
*  Because there was a guy that was speculating that some of the things
*  that she says, the way she sort of disconnected sometimes.
*  I don't know what these rambles that I don't understand
*  of certain anti-anxiety medication.
*  I do not know if this is true.
*  See if you can find that because really that would say that about
*  that would make future president.
*  Yeah, I feel she's going to win.
*  No, she's not. She can win.
*  She absolutely can win.
*  I do not think she's going to win because the more she talks,
*  like in 2020, she how bad you have to be that you can't even make Iowa.
*  She couldn't even compete with the mayor of South Bend.
*  I feel like we are in this very bizarre time
*  where people are giving in to the bullshit in a way
*  that I never suspected people would before.
*  And this is one they just want no Trump no matter what.
*  And they're willing to gaslight themselves.
*  They think that. And by the way, I think Hillary could win.
*  If Hillary jumped back in.
*  I've been saying that for months.
*  If Hillary jumped back in, I think the problem was also the money
*  because there was the two.
*  I was like two hundred and fifty million dollars in the campaign fund that has
*  if it only works. Right.
*  She's on the ticket. Right.
*  So that's part of the problem.
*  But I feel like Hillary could win.
*  She won the popular vote in 2020.
*  Hillary, I've been saying this for a year in different shows.
*  And she would have won it.
*  Michelle Obama could win, too.
*  I don't think she wanted to do it. You don't think so?
*  I don't. I think that's kind of this.
*  You sound like your parents. I think it's this boomer idea.
*  She doesn't want it.
*  I'm not saying that she would be awesome at it.
*  But I think anyone can win of either party.
*  Yeah. Whoever the nominee is like you pretty even Chris Christie
*  could have won if he's the Republican nominee.
*  I was thought that Trump getting shot would like that's it.
*  Election's over. But it's like they memory hold that so quick.
*  You would have thought Trump getting shot would have had four year
*  eight years of corporate journalists talking about hate speech, causing violence
*  to be like, let's take a step back.
*  And that went for what? A week.
*  They did take a step back for a little bit.
*  For a week. And then they went right back at him.
*  You want to talk to this memory holding?
*  Yeah. With the the insanity of the who's that?
*  That was Elon who put up like if you Google President Donald,
*  it says President Donald Reagan.
*  No, I tried it. What happened?
*  Maybe they fixed it. It said President Donald Trump.
*  OK, well, he had a screenshot.
*  So yeah, no, no, no.
*  I mean, what it's based on a lot of things, right?
*  Like what people are searching for.
*  I would imagine that the assassination attempt on Trump
*  would be the first one that you would see.
*  Yeah. Assassination attempt on President
*  right, Trump, because that's the most recent.
*  Yes. But it's not. And most newsworthy.
*  But it does show it.
*  You just have to type it all in, which is interesting, because
*  that little difference between what you can find
*  and what you get presented immediately has a huge shift
*  in the way people access information.
*  And this is Robert Epstein's work. The creepy line, the documentary.
*  I want you to watch it. Yeah.
*  And this this thing is very real.
*  And what it is is like if you try to Google certain
*  negative stories, like negative stories on people,
*  it will overwhelm you with positive stories.
*  It'll take a long time before you get to the negative story.
*  Yeah. How he explained it is if you here's how they can tip the scale.
*  Yeah. If I Google Hillary Clinton and I have it.
*  So Google gives fairly positive stories about Hillary's the first 10 results.
*  You're not going to go to the second page.
*  If I Google Donald Trump and Google gives you seven negative stories,
*  it's going to move the needle a little bit toward her.
*  Quite a bit. Yeah. Quite a bit.
*  Like if you're a person who's on the fence,
*  you know, like maybe Donald Trump's not a bad guy.
*  And then you Google him and then you start reading some of these
*  like pieces that they've written about him.
*  It'll change your perspective.
*  You really think she's going to win?
*  I'm not. I'm saying it because she could.
*  I'm not saying she's going to.
*  I'm not saying because I want to.
*  I'm just being honest.
*  Like I could see her winning.
*  I don't think I think she's going to lose a lot of black male vote.
*  Really? That's I don't think they're going to go in the booth
*  and pull the lever for her, like they did for Biden, who was Obama's boy.
*  When Trump came out to 50 Cent,
*  that many men, you know, wished death upon me and N word and everything
*  like didn't censor it out.
*  Everybody's like, oh, shit, he won.
*  It was it happened so quickly, the shift from, oh, my God,
*  they shot him to fuck him again. Yeah.
*  It's like people are questioning whether or not he actually got shot
*  because his ear healed.
*  Can I wait? I got to tell you something else about him.
*  He was on who was the Fox guy who just died with Stu Varney
*  a couple of years ago.
*  And he goes, Stu, that's the N word.
*  You know what the N word is, right, Stu?
*  And Stu's like, oh, it goes nuclear, the nuclear word.
*  And I was on the Blaze Glenn Beck's network for midterms.
*  And Trump calls in and he's like, that's the N word.
*  Nuclear. I'm like, are we really doing this right now?
*  Trump's talk about the N word. Yeah.
*  He needs nuclear. Yeah. It was it was nuts.
*  It's hilarious. What is this?
*  Trump did not walk out to 50 Cent, but rather to a country singer.
*  So is that fake?
*  Those videos are fake. We walked out. Oh.
*  Yeah, those videos go around the Internet.
*  Oh, wait, wait, no. Posted.
*  No, I thought the guy was saying it in disbelief.
*  That's him going out.
*  Scroll down, because it says under under it, there was an explanation in text.
*  What does it say there?
*  Oh, it was not. It was fake.
*  Oh, they faked it.
*  Oh, damn it.
*  Well, now we know what he should do next.
*  So he definitely should have came out to that.
*  Hilarious. Oh, my God.
*  That would have been epic.
*  50 Cent was tweeting about him.
*  50 Cent have his face at his concert.
*  So he had like, you know, he has that image of him in the back.
*  And he put Donald Trump's head over his body.
*  But do you know what? Maybe that's fake, too.
*  There's a big sea change, because even three years ago,
*  if you had said Trump kind of sucks,
*  I don't really like him.
*  He had nobody's being president.
*  You're a Trump supporter, because unless you say
*  he's the worst thing to happen in America, you're a Trump supporter. Right. Right.
*  So for Mark Zuckerberg to go on camera and be like,
*  this guy was kind of a badass and that was awesome.
*  And not to have any.
*  And to be feel safe to say that, not to have any negative consequences.
*  That's a big deal in terms of the conversation moving.
*  Well, I do not think that Mark Zuckerberg, from my interactions with him,
*  was very comfortable with the FBI telling them to suppress the Hunter Biden
*  laptop. Let's talk about this, because there's a lot of people who I don't blame
*  them think, oh, boo, you're forcing me to do it, but he's happy to do it anyway.
*  So you're saying that he actually it was like, well, he brought it up.
*  I mean, when I asked, I asked him what they did with it.
*  He told the whole story. He didn't try to hide from it at all.
*  And he said they basically reduced its the ability to spread.
*  Right. You could post it. You could read it.
*  You could interact with it.
*  But they reduced its reach right by like 50 percent or something like that,
*  or whatever the number was, which I don't understand how you do that or what are you doing?
*  Well, I don't know. I'll let that go.
*  You can understand because if you on Facebook, which I would get recommended.
*  So no, not recommended. I'm not a Facebook for this reason.
*  Your feed. I don't see all my friends posts.
*  Right. So if they just have it post 50 percent less, it's very easy to do.
*  Right. I think that's Instagram as well.
*  Yes. Same company. Same sort of deal.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you see that with people.
*  That's what shadow banning is. Right.
*  It's difficult for people to see your shit. Right.
*  They do that on purpose.
*  Of course they do. And they can't do it by accident.
*  No, I mean, it's a it's a real thing.
*  I don't know if he's comfortable with the government telling them to do something
*  that turned out to be an actual true story.
*  Is that what he said? No.
*  I mean, I have to imagine by him saying that that's one of the most badass things
*  that I've ever seen. He's got a reasonable perspective because it was one of those bad
*  ass things. Whether you love Donald Trump or not, let's pretend he's from another country.
*  You have no stake in the game.
*  That guy almost getting shot and raising his fist up like that.
*  And there's so many fucking weird things about that story,
*  the story of the assassination itself.
*  You should be for everyone should be really uncomfortable with the fact that that happened
*  and not like saying even get shot.
*  Yeah, I miss in the whole point.
*  I tweet this out. I go, which the White House we're freaking out about this as much there
*  about climate change, because this would be a big moment to be like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
*  Like, this can never happen again.
*  But when Steve Scalise got shot, they were like, and then went back to business.
*  Like didn't should happen.
*  Also, why were they streaming it?
*  They don't stream his campaign things.
*  They do it a lot. Do they do it a lot?
*  Oh, yeah. They do it a lot.
*  Oh, yeah. CNN does it a lot.
*  Not CNN. CNN did this one.
*  Yeah. The FBI kind of added some problems to this, too.
*  What would they say?
*  They said they were unclear on whether he was actually shot pierced by a bullet
*  or a fragmented portion of one.
*  Oh, so it could have been a ricochet.
*  A shrapnel. Yeah.
*  Yeah, because I know there was something that got hit.
*  There was a video that I saw of a railing that got hit.
*  So it might have been a piece of the bullet that hit his ear.
*  But also, how are we not seeing this kid's social media? Right.
*  Also, did you read the story about the examination of his house?
*  That it was completely scrubbed.
*  There's no silverware.
*  It was like spotless, like a team went over it
*  and scrubbed it.
*  If oh, wow. OK. Yeah.
*  Also, did you hear the story about how someone using ad tracking?
*  So, you know, they can find out where you're going just based on ad tracking.
*  And they found that someone from a building near the FBI offices
*  was regularly visiting this kid.
*  Back. Oh, seriously? Yes.
*  Yeah. Find that, Jamie.
*  I just got the video about the house.
*  I'm trying to see. We also don't even know how the video of the house
*  first, and then we'll go to it also just the sidebar.
*  We don't know.
*  MKUltra was a real thing to think they don't do that anymore.
*  Oh, come on.
*  I believe we had people that participated in that
*  securing of it.
*  There were bomb assets that we provided.
*  Mr. Chairman, can I have 30 more seconds?
*  Yeah, yeah. I'm letting everybody count.
*  OK. On the night of since then.
*  None. Did you get any reports from any of your agents
*  of anything fishy at the home?
*  I was briefed on.
*  Was there any silverware found in the home or trash?
*  I have no nothing in the briefing that I was given.
*  I guess maybe he's reporting on that report.
*  Yeah, he must be reporting on that report.
*  So that's not that's a very incomplete.
*  Remember the Las Vegas shooter? Yeah.
*  That's a weird one to just complete for it. Just stop talking about it.
*  Yeah, there's a lot of those that you go, what the fuck is that?
*  What is that? Why they do that?
*  The fact that we're talking about January 6th for years and this is just like,
*  yeah, it's that.
*  Well, January 6th was a lot of people and a lot of it is.
*  This is a presidential candidate. Come on.
*  I mean, oh, it's all fucked, man. It's fucked.
*  It's weird. The whole thing is weird.
*  This kid had these devices and remote controls for detonators,
*  like very sophisticated stuff.
*  He had three overseas bank accounts and cryptic.
*  Is that true? Yeah, that I didn't know.
*  Yeah. Find that out.
*  Three encrypted accounts, I believe, are why this stuff I read.
*  I hear you. But the point is, I'm this should be what CNN and Fox
*  lead with every night. Oh, yeah.
*  Like this should be the scandal. Right.
*  This should be like, remember, OJ, what is this?
*  We knew about a judge. What was his name?
*  Was it judges? Alito? Yeah.
*  We knew about Judge Alito sneakers.
*  Like they every detail of that trial was obsessed.
*  But here it's just the right.
*  Well, we still don't know what's on the Epstein client list.
*  Or or that was it 80 Congress people had sexual harassment suits that under seal.
*  How about the 51 intelligence former intelligence agents
*  that the Hunter Hunter Biden laptop was bullshit and zero consequences for any of them?
*  The bank account thing might not have been real.
*  They might have backtrack on that. Oh, do they?
*  It just says it might have been linked to an online gaming site or something.
*  That might have been a fake account. So why he has accounts.
*  I'm trying to I'm trying to understand.
*  OK, see what you see what you get.
*  So it's hard to know what's true and what's not true.
*  And it's hard to know what's bullshit, what's not bullshit.
*  But what we definitely know is that they knew about this kid in advance
*  that he had a rangefinder.
*  They saw him walking around with a rangefinder that somehow or another
*  he got up onto that fucking roof that they knew he was on that roof
*  and that they saw him with a rifle and didn't shoot him.
*  Yeah. And he got off three shots before they shot him.
*  I heard he took horse paced.
*  No way. Son of a bitch.
*  What a lunatic. He's definitely a right winger.
*  Interesting. Maybe he's a never Trump.
*  But he was registered for the Republican Party, which doesn't mean anything.
*  But he donated to some.
*  But I let the yeah. Yeah.
*  Donated to Biden, I believe.
*  The whole thing is really squirrely and it just makes you wonder.
*  What about that whole sloped roof bullshit?
*  That's wild. The fuck are you talking about?
*  I'll it's too dangerous to be on that sloped roof.
*  Meanwhile, they had snipers on another roof that was sloped.
*  Even if not, it's like figured out.
*  It's the it's the president.
*  Yeah. I mean, they had that kid.
*  They were looking at him.
*  They saw what he was doing.
*  Here's the thing, though. OK, I got to put this out there.
*  He's going back to Butler to give another rally at the same place.
*  Yeah. It'd be really funny if, you know, at this point,
*  it's kind of like when she's asking for it.
*  You know what I mean?
*  But if they get him again, the same spot, like, come on, this time, they use a drone.
*  That's the yeah.
*  The kid had iron sights on his rifle.
*  Does that mean interesting? He did not have a scope.
*  So iron sights are you're lining it up like this.
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. OK. I think you said iron sights.
*  OK. Yeah. Sights.
*  So you didn't have a scope, but it wasn't a long shot.
*  It was like 150 yards.
*  And if he went center mass instead of a headshot, he probably would kill them.
*  I mean, I don't know if Trump wears a bulletproof vest.
*  Oh, that's a good. Yeah, that's a good question.
*  Yeah. Probably at this point, hopefully he does.
*  Hopefully he does.
*  But if they if that guy just shot center mass, he'd hit him.
*  He would hit him.
*  I mean, you're dealing with a variance of this or various.
*  Yeah. Right.
*  And so the Trump's a big dude.
*  If the bullet did nick his ear, it might have been a piece of shrapnel.
*  Who knows? But it definitely shot someone behind him and killed him.
*  Killed that one guy was a fire.
*  Did you see Joanne Reed?
*  Would she say Biden survived COVID?
*  So it's oh, yeah, it's basically kind of like the same.
*  Yeah, they they're so gas lit up.
*  They don't even know what the fuck they're saying.
*  They don't even know how ridiculous it is.
*  Jen Psaki's there. It's not like, uh huh.
*  Oh, yeah. Same thing.
*  Yeah. Basically the same thing because she knows better.
*  So she's just like, oh, shit, like I got to kind of play ball.
*  Yeah.
*  Jory is a gem.
*  She's a good.
*  How does she have a worse hairline than Joe Biden?
*  How is that fucking possible?
*  The whole fucking online pundit thing is so strange.
*  Or excuse me, on television pundit thing is so strange.
*  What way?
*  Well, it's just like it's we it's so clear it's contrived.
*  Yeah. So obviously, Joe, it's not obvious.
*  When we were in the 80s, when Hacksaw Jim Duggan got arrested with the Iron Sheik,
*  people were like, what?
*  They don't he's not actually from Iran.
*  It's not a terrorist.
*  Like that was a moment. Don't you remember?
*  Yes, I do remember that.
*  So for a lot of people, if or they'll tell you, you don't know that,
*  you know, this celebrity takes steroids to gain 60 pounds in three months
*  for this movie, maybe he's just got great genetics.
*  And it's just like, guys.
*  But that's how people think.
*  Yeah. What's on their screen is they think their screen is a window. Right.
*  And they've been infantilized.
*  Yes. Over decades of this bullshit being pumped into their face.
*  It's so funny how few people even know what MKUltra was
*  that the government really did try to make assassins and try.
*  They tried all this on their own people.
*  Oh, yeah. But I tried them on all kinds of people.
*  I've said this, I think, on the show before.
*  You can go after the president, the Republicans, the Democrats,
*  the universities, journalists, whatever you want.
*  Only when you question CIA, you're a crazy person.
*  Everything else is fine. It's on the table.
*  CIA. Oh, you must be a crazy person.
*  Interesting. Yeah, you must be.
*  They're looking out for your best interests.
*  And even if you told them Google MKUltra or Mockingbird
*  and they look it up themselves, it still won't permeate.
*  Well, they'll say that was that.
*  Yeah. They don't do that anymore.
*  Those are the 60s.
*  Yeah. People are just crazy.
*  A lot of oversight now. There's racism.
*  Yes. A lot of racism. Yeah.
*  There's oversight now. You can't do that anymore.
*  It's insane. You don't have to worry about it.
*  Yeah. I mean, that's when people want to talk about what the deep state is.
*  That's the deep state.
*  The people that can pull the strings that aren't elected officials.
*  J. Edgar Hoover. Yeah.
*  He was more powerful. Who was he accountable to? Nobody.
*  Did he really wear dresses and shit? That's bullshit.
*  Bullshit, right?
*  It's one of those things that they put out there and it's bullshit.
*  There's no source. They did it to get to him.
*  Yeah. This was after he died.
*  It came out. Supposedly.
*  But you would think that someone's always going after someone's secrets
*  who want to have a few secrets of his own.
*  Well, yeah, I'm sure he has some.
*  Especially back then.
*  I'm sure he had some secrets.
*  That was the ultimate one.
*  That he really is a cross dresser.
*  Which is a good thing. You didn't put him on hormones, right?
*  Or maybe it's a bad thing.
*  Maybe it's a bad thing. Maybe he would have calmed himself down.
*  He would be a lot nicer.
*  Maybe. Yeah.
*  Or maybe we got hysterical.
*  Got down to hysterical.
*  Like Nixon bitch slapping him in the oval office.
*  Maybe we start really using some of that information that he has.
*  I want to make a plea.
*  OK. To the president, because I know he doesn't.
*  Which one? Biden? Joe Biden.
*  I know he doesn't list this show, but I know his staff does.
*  So Donald Trump at the Libertarian Convention a couple of months ago
*  promised to free Ross Ulbricht if he gets elected.
*  Did he really? Yes. Interesting.
*  He made this commitment.
*  So I'm saying to the Biden administration now, you can make a fool out of Trump.
*  You can take this issue off the table.
*  It's probably going to be the margin.
*  New Hampshire, there's a lot of people who are supporters in tech circles.
*  You can free Ross Ulbricht today.
*  You got Julian Assange out of jail with a lot of institutional opposition.
*  No one has institutional opposition to Ross.
*  Yep. He's not killed anyone, not been accused of killing anyone.
*  He's doing double life, even though he's not a violent criminal.
*  There's no concern of recidivism.
*  So, Mr. President, make an asshole out of Trump.
*  You can say Republicans promise Democrats deliver
*  and you could free Ross Ulbricht today.
*  Commute a sentence.
*  There's a lot of weirdness in that case, too, right?
*  Yes, there is.
*  There's a lot of weirdness in terms of entrapment.
*  Yes. And he's been he's he's it's as if he killed a bunch of people
*  that have double life. It's crazy.
*  All right. So this is something that's very easy for him to do
*  and get a lot of people to support or at least stay home and not support Trump.
*  So every vote counts.
*  Silk Road was a way that you could buy pretty much anything.
*  It was like a black market website.
*  Yeah. You could buy pretty much anything.
*  It's like torrenting, but with drugs and weapons and wasn't it
*  what weren't there murders for hire and stuff, too?
*  I think there were. Yeah. Yeah.
*  He's not been accused of that or charged that certainly.
*  Was not one of the things that he had signed off on someone getting assassinated.
*  That's one of these rumors.
*  That's not what they charged him with at all. No.
*  And it's like, if that was the thing, why are you charging with that?
*  What did they charge him with?
*  I don't even remember. What was it, Jamie?
*  It was some bullshit.
*  Ulbricht was charged with engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise,
*  narcotics conspiracy, conspiracy to commit money laundering,
*  conspiracy to commit computer hacking.
*  On August 21st, 2014, a superseding indictment
*  added three additional charges of February 4th, 2015.
*  Ulbricht was convicted on all counts after a jury trial
*  that had taken place on January 15th, 2015.
*  So double life plus 40 years without the possibility for all.
*  Two life sentences plus 40 years.
*  Nine years he's been in jail now.
*  So just in case science comes along and they can keep him alive forever.
*  He's also ordered to pay about one hundred and eighty three million
*  in restitution based on the total sales of illegal drugs
*  and counterfeit IDs through Silk Road.
*  Wow. That's crazy.
*  So even if he gets out, he's got to pay one hundred and eighty
*  three million dollars in restitution.
*  I don't know if he has to do that. Holy fuck.
*  They dropped it.
*  Federal prosecutors allege that Ulbricht had paid seven hundred
*  and thirty thousand dollars in a murder for hire deals,
*  targeting at least five people, allegedly because they threatened
*  to reveal Silk Road, the Silk Road enterprise.
*  Prosecutors believe no contracted killing actually occurred.
*  And he was not charged.
*  Was not charged in his trial in New York Federal Court with murder for hire.
*  But evidence was introduced at trial supporting the allegations.
*  The district court found a preponderance of the evidence
*  that Ulbricht did commission the murders.
*  So it seems like he did commission them.
*  The evidence that Ulbricht had, according to them, had commissioned murders
*  were considered by the judge in sentencing Ulbricht to life
*  and was a factor in the Second Circuit's decision to uphold the sentence.
*  He wasn't charged with it. Right.
*  He's been there.
*  It's crazy though that they don't charge him with it,
*  but they use it as a consideration.
*  That is kind of crazy. That is crazy.
*  Are you allowed to do that?
*  Apparently, if you have the evidence for that, put it up
*  and let him be tried for it.
*  And I got to tell you, I don't think that's going to get you double life
*  in any other case.
*  And isn't he like a yoga teacher now?
*  He teaches people how to read.
*  Yeah. He's like a model prisoner.
*  Yeah. He fucked up.
*  Let him out. You know, this idea of like, you want to have total freedom
*  and we're going to just circumvent the system and do it online.
*  They just wanted to squash that and put as much water on that fire
*  as is humanly possible. And the point's been made.
*  So he's served his time.
*  Mr. President, please let him out right now.
*  Why do you have the Hellraiser box?
*  Oh, I wanted to give me and this is from Cabin the Woods.
*  You ever see Cabin the Woods? The movie? Yeah.
*  That's Pornichus's orb.
*  Oh, that's a fun movie.
*  I have these normally in my bedroom, obviously.
*  Oh, so you put them here for your vibe? Yeah.
*  Oh, no. Really? Yeah. Yeah.
*  That's so bizarre. Is it?
*  Why do you have the Hellraiser box?
*  Because it goes well with the orb.
*  Is it functional? The Hellraiser box?
*  No, but this one is. Move around?
*  Oh, it is? This is functional. What does that do?
*  Here. Careful, though.
*  OK. It's not cheap.
*  What does it do? Oh, it moves around. Yeah.
*  And does it open?
*  Careful, careful. You don't want to open a door.
*  Oh, really?
*  How does this work?
*  Well, you just do it. You spin it around?
*  Yeah. And then doorways open.
*  Oh, doorways. We don't need that.
*  We don't need that area.
*  Imagine if, like, some wild shit goes down, like fucking Malice and Rogan.
*  They opened up the doorway.
*  I think it'd be like a fucking Malice that they knew.
*  Opened up the fucking... Yeah, the Hellraiser box.
*  Yeah. Clearly satanic.
*  Lament configuration. That's it?
*  That's the orb. Wow.
*  And that's like a conjuring type deal?
*  Well, he was the lord of what?
*  Bonage and pain from the movie.
*  He's a xenobite, obviously. Yeah.
*  Cabin in the woods was a fun fucking movie. I love that movie.
*  It was a fun movie. That's Josh Whedon.
*  It was, really? Yeah.
*  It was like a love letter to horror movies.
*  It was a good movie. Sigourney Weaver was excellent.
*  Oh, so I don't want to spoil it, but Sigourney Weaver was in and she's superb.
*  It's also it really straddles the line between silly and actually scary.
*  It does really well.
*  It's like it's a movie for the fans. Yeah.
*  Like you watch you like, OK, this guy's talking to me through the screen.
*  Like it's like, right.
*  Yeah, it's like it's like you have to love horror movies to really love.
*  Because there's so many Easter eggs.
*  You got to sit down and be like, who's this? Who's that?
*  Like, oh, he's a xenobite. That's what that reference is.
*  Werewolves. Yeah. Yeah. Fun ass movie. Yeah, I love that.
*  So that's why you brought these things just to have a good vibe.
*  So you always have that in front of you when you work?
*  No, it's in my bedroom.
*  Oh, OK. Right where you sleep.
*  That's where I sleep. Where you rest your head.
*  You put that on one side.
*  It's on the night. Do it.
*  They're on the nightstand.
*  The same nightstand or on opposite the same nightstand?
*  Is that the one you stare at before you close your eyes?
*  I don't. What do you say?
*  Your spells.
*  Hmm.
*  Spells.
*  And that's how I laugh.
*  And then I go to sleep.
*  Well, there's so many people online because everyone's so skeptical
*  and because conspiracies are so fun.
*  Everyone thinks that everything is satanic.
*  Yes. You know, everything.
*  Like that was what people thought about the Prince Charles painting or King Charles.
*  I like the King Charles painting.
*  Like someone's fucking with him.
*  Like that guy's like that's a subtle dig on the history of the UK empire.
*  It looked like it was something on a hot topic.
*  It looks crazy. Yeah.
*  But like people try to find like Baphomet in there.
*  If you're, you know, turn it upside down.
*  And then fold it in half.
*  You know how you know the guy was fucking with him
*  because he left his sausage fingers in there.
*  You know how he's got really fucked up hands?
*  He does?
*  Like Jamie, pull up King Charles hands. It's insane.
*  Oh, they're like inflamed.
*  They're like sausage.
*  It's like in that movie with everything everywhere all at once.
*  Like, yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  That's he's probably got a disease.
*  Yeah. You think?
*  Jesus Christ, that's so inflamed.
*  Yeah. God, that's so unhealthy.
*  What's wrong with his hands?
*  I don't know.
*  Oh, sausage fingers.
*  Wow. Let's scroll up so you get a look at that.
*  They didn't even show it.
*  They just show a picture of him.
*  Let's see the hands.
*  That looks fairly OK.
*  A little swollen.
*  What caused the swollen hands?
*  Cause a variety of things.
*  Support to discuss symptoms with your doctor.
*  Does it show his hands down there?
*  Yeah, there you go.
*  OK, right there. That looks crazy.
*  That looks crazy.
*  That looks like you're never getting that ring off.
*  First of all, I feel bad for Camilla.
*  They can't feel nice.
*  You're going to have to do this.
*  They still do it.
*  Of course, don't you?
*  They've got to be. They're all perverts.
*  You think so?
*  The royal family.
*  Are they all perverts? They're all perverts.
*  Really? Of course.
*  All this such a thing with like aristocracy.
*  They're all perverts.
*  That's why they're not having sex with kids because they like it.
*  They're having sex with kids so they can.
*  The aristocracy has sex with kids?
*  Is that what we just said?
*  Prince Philip was on that.
*  Was it Philip? No, no.
*  Prince Charles, the other one.
*  Andrew. He was on.
*  He was buddies with Epstein.
*  We've got all the receipts.
*  And then when they caught him, he goes, well, I don't sweat anymore.
*  I don't sweat anymore.
*  Yeah. He said I was at the Falklands and I caught some thing and now I don't
*  sweat anymore. So there you go.
*  Look this up, Jamie.
*  I'm not making this up.
*  That was his excuse.
*  I don't sweat anymore.
*  Some weird thing about like the story can't be true because I don't sweat.
*  Yeah.
*  One of the Duke of York's claims in his Newsnight interview was that he cannot
*  physically sweat.
*  Let's find out, bro.
*  Let's put that bitch in a sauna and see if he's a liar.
*  Yeah, so there was there you go.
*  Virginia Guffrey.
*  Just tried dancing with you and you profusely sweating and then she went on
*  to have a bath, possibly.
*  Prince Andrew replies, there's a slight problem with the sweating because I have
*  a peculiar medical condition, which I don't sweat or I didn't sweat at the time.
*  And that was what I can get the clip of him saying this because it sounds so crazy.
*  It's a time because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of
*  adrenaline in the Falklands war when I was shot at.
*  Oh, that's a good way to divert.
*  That's crazy.
*  You you are around you guys all the time.
*  There are there are adrenaline's through the roof because they're like in a life
*  and death situation.
*  Yeah, they all sweat.
*  This isn't a thing.
*  Right. But there is a medical condition where you don't the guy who does that
*  sculpture out there that the sea monster saw, he can't sweat.
*  It's really bad.
*  He was in the Falklands.
*  No, no, no. He just has a real condition.
*  Oh, yeah, but that's the thing.
*  But that's not something you develop.
*  Right. It's not.
*  Well, I don't know if you can develop.
*  You can't develop for getting shot at Joe because what Trump can't sweat anymore.
*  I mean, maybe it's just rarely happens when someone blows a fuse.
*  OK, I'm not I'm just I'm not a doctor.
*  I'm not like an apologist for this.
*  You're a pretty much a fucker.
*  I think you're sweating right now.
*  It's so simple to find out this is true, though, because let's get
*  interesting that you say that, sir.
*  We have a sauna or 195 degrees or we just turn up the air.
*  This doctor in this article, he says, OK, a physician, Dr.
*  James Hammond wrote in The Atlantic at the time in case of the case,
*  the dubious claim, the dubiousness of this claim is not already evident
*  from its context nested in a sea of dubious claims.
*  This is a dubious claim.
*  OK, there are people who cannot sweat or who sweat very little.
*  Such a propensity to appear cool and collected while everyone else is flushed
*  and damp has been attributed to the inevitably
*  and viably high status through to the inevitably
*  and invariably high status throughout history.
*  I'm sorry. I'm reading it while thinking.
*  But the medical condition of not producing sweat.
*  OK, this is the stuff that my friend has.
*  Yeah, dross is extremely undesirable.
*  The function is vitally important way to cool the body down.
*  McVader, the guy who does all the kiltoni and mothership stuff.
*  He has that too.
*  So two guys I know, both guys named Scott, oddly enough.
*  Scott, who made the incredible artwork and Scott, the McVader
*  who does other incredible artwork.
*  Both of the guys like legitimately can't sweat, but they didn't.
*  You can't develop it.
*  And certainly not from adrenaline. It's a thing.
*  It's a genetic thing.
*  Like this, some people can't feel pain, which is really bad.
*  It's not a temporary condition such as Hamlin
*  as concludes a temporary inability to sweat would defy medical precedent.
*  OK, so it's bullshit. It's bullshit. Pure bullshit.
*  Yes. He just wanted to make that as a nice like, look, by the way,
*  I got shot at the Falkland war.
*  I couldn't have raped that girl. I was shot in the war.
*  Yeah. But I also don't believe he was shot at.
*  Probably wasn't. They're not going to put the prince in line of fire.
*  The Falklands. Maybe it's like that dude from NBC. Brian.
*  Yeah, Williams. Yeah.
*  What about Hillary? Yeah, she was one, too.
*  So I was on a sniper fire.
*  Yeah, the first lady is going to sniper fire. Yeah, OK.
*  Yeah, that was a weird one, right?
*  Yes. Weird.
*  Yeah, the first lady is going to Bosnia.
*  They're just going to let people take shots at her.
*  Well, they did it to Trump. So maybe it to her.
*  Saying you can't sweat is so crazy because they could find out so easy
*  if you sweat like it's not like a difficult thing.
*  Well, sir, did you mind sitting in this on?
*  But it's it's also like maybe she got let's pretend.
*  Let's just take it at face value.
*  She could have gotten that aspect.
*  The story wrong doesn't mean you weren't there with her.
*  It's like she would misremember that you're sweating.
*  She just think you stunk. Oh, there you go.
*  You're sweating. She said she misspoke.
*  And last week, she gave a dramatic description of her arrival in Bosnia
*  12 years ago.
*  We're counting a landing under sniper fire.
*  And she had to duck and run. OK.
*  She said, so if I misspoke, that was just a misstatement.
*  What does that mean?
*  So a lot of things, millions of words a day.
*  So if I misspoke, that was just a misstatement.
*  So if I make an incantation that summons Beelzebub
*  and he rises from a crack in the earth.
*  Well, you got that was just a misstatement.
*  I say millions of words a day.
*  If you put a million chimpanzees for a million years, typewriters,
*  they'll make the works of Shakespeare.
*  Why would Beelzebub come from a crack in the earth?
*  You know, he's a lord of the sky.
*  I remember landing under sniper fire.
*  There was supposed to be some kind of greeting ceremony at the airport.
*  But instead, we ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles
*  to get to our base.
*  And there is footage of her landing and they're giving her flowers and it's kids.
*  It's it's not like it wasn't a video.
*  Both Clintons held their heads up and did not appear rushed.
*  So the video. Oh, yeah.
*  Presented her with the poem. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Eight year old Bosnia girl presented her with a poem
*  and later greeting US troops.
*  So it's just she.
*  You believe that thing about all the monkeys?
*  You leave them alone with the typewriter for a million years.
*  They compose all the works of Shakespeare.
*  Yeah, that's mathematically definite.
*  But what do you mean here? I don't believe it.
*  What do you mean? I think it's going to be all fucked up.
*  But if you do it long enough, infinitely, every permutation to edit that,
*  you'd have to find all the works of Shakespeare.
*  Rogan, you don't edit Shakespeare.
*  You have to find all those words in this monkey.
*  There's no way they're going to write those letters in that order.
*  If it's infinite. Yes. Infinite. Right.
*  That's the whole point. I think infinitely, it sucks infinitely.
*  I think unless they evolve, if it's infinite
*  and then the monkeys grow up to become humans and they figure out
*  if you're hitting keys at random, eventually you're going to write out
*  Shakespeare's perfectly. Yes.
*  Just a time thing. Yes.
*  And yeah, it'll take trillions of years. Right. But one day. Right.
*  The end period. Imagine.
*  So imagine like like our proof of intelligent life is just proof of infinity.
*  Like, oh, my God, we found an incredible book, like a guidebook for human beings.
*  It's really just a bunch of space monkeys
*  pounding on a typewriter for fucking billions of years.
*  And you know, that book is called The Art of the Deal.
*  It's like one space monkey figures out paper
*  and then the other space monkey finds a typewriter
*  that an alien civilization has dropped off there, just sort of like they do
*  with us with spaceships when they just crash land.
*  They just drop them off a typewriter.
*  I just read a story of this monkey was in a zoo chimp for like 50 years.
*  It just finally died. It was really sad.
*  But I read the story and they said, well, it was originally being raised
*  by someone in their house, and then they took it to the zoo.
*  And it's just like and they bought it at a pet store in New York.
*  Like a chimp. Yeah, I used to be able to do that.
*  Remember the lady in Connecticut? Yeah, that's what I was thinking about.
*  I'm like, who thinks this is a good idea?
*  Yeah, there's a lot of nutty people out there that don't understand what a chimpanzee is.
*  There was a piece recently, Jamie,
*  where they were studying old videos of chimpanzees,
*  and they believe that some chimpanzees are capable of human words.
*  See if you can find that this is like a very new discovery.
*  So they were examining some older videos and they believe that some chimpanzees here,
*  old videos of chimpanzees suggest they are capable of speech.
*  So these are some old videos that they had done.
*  So a small team of speech specialists, psychologists in Sweden, the UK
*  and Switzerland is found via study of old videos that at least three chimpanzees
*  had learned to speak human words, suggesting that the animals are capable of
*  learning this ability given the right circumstances.
*  The work is published in the journal Scientific Reports.
*  And that wild. Huh.
*  So some of them know how to say some words, Papa or Cup, Mama, Papa or Cup.
*  But their work was discredited over the years as unethical
*  because the chimp was taken from its natural mother.
*  And this new effort, the research team wondered if dismissal of these findings
*  was done in absence of attempts to duplicate their efforts
*  to find out that might have been the case.
*  They searched for the video evidence of such attempts at training
*  and found three videos showing evidence that chimpanzees can be taught
*  to speak human words in a rudimentary way.
*  Scared to hear this. Yeah. So terrible.
*  Can you say Mama? Mama.
*  Is this for Mama?
*  You love your mama? You love Mama?
*  Here, sweetie.
*  This is for you. That's just a grunt.
*  That's for you. I'm saying Mama, dude.
*  Yeah, but it doesn't know what that means.
*  Well, let's see it say other things.
*  It says Cup.
*  That sounded like it sounded like Mama, but doesn't mean the if you can.
*  Good boy, John. I love you.
*  Love you, Johnny.
*  You like that? Is that good?
*  You could teach huskies to say I love you, too.
*  I guess that I can teach you that noise, Mama.
*  The chimp doesn't think that the owner is its mother.
*  Right. It doesn't understand what that means.
*  It's just saying that. Yeah, absolutely.
*  Right, right, right.
*  So even if you speak, it's saying the noise.
*  Right, right, right. It doesn't understand what it's saying.
*  That is different.
*  So they know that they could teach gorillas sign language, though, right?
*  Right. But the interesting thing about I think with that,
*  that might be overblown because my understanding is the gorillas never ask questions.
*  Right. So it's always a response to a cue.
*  And gorillas are extremely intelligent.
*  It's not a dispute, but like, what are they actually are they mimicking?
*  Knowing gets them what they want.
*  Because I know that the most famous one, Coco, called it was mad once.
*  Supposedly she he was Coco Boy.
*  Mail. That's what it's a kindergarten teacher decide.
*  Our next president. And yes.
*  And Coco called her like a dirty toilet devil.
*  Whoa. And I'm like, a gorilla doesn't know what a devil is.
*  You can't teach a gorilla the concept of devil.
*  That's not a word. Right. Right.
*  Yeah, that's ridiculous. That is interesting.
*  So maybe they don't know how to express themselves, but they can crudely interact with ideas.
*  So it's not as simple as maybe they don't even have a sense of self to the point where they can express themselves.
*  Like, I'm hungry. I'm very tired right now.
*  I'm tired doing these tricks for you. I don't like this.
*  The other thing to be in this cage anymore.
*  The other thing that really blew my mind is they had a thing where they taught dogs.
*  There's two pictures. Is it a boy?
*  Sometimes use the sign for devil as an insult.
*  She also named a parrot devil tooth after initially being frightened of it.
*  And the famous joke the aristocrats told by Coco the gorilla.
*  Coco says devil Ingrid is a girl. OK.
*  Coco was a girl who mastered sign language and raised kittens.
*  She died at the age of 46.
*  But you don't you can't teach the concept of devil to an animal.
*  That's imagine being trapped in a fucking building that's run by gorillas.
*  And they tell you what to do and they give you bananas and they try to get you to grunt at them.
*  And you're like, oh, my God, is there any fucking people around here?
*  How bad would that suck? Well, that's how bad it's like for Coco.
*  It didn't because they think because dogs think of us as the same thing as them.
*  How do you know that Coco does?
*  Maybe Coco would have been way more happy with a bunch of gorillas.
*  Maybe I would think so.
*  Probably dogs are happy with dogs.
*  Dogs are happy with people.
*  They're a little happier with dogs.
*  I want to be around people. Yes.
*  So there is an experiment they ran.
*  And I still don't understand what's going on in the dog's head where they put up two pictures
*  and the dogs were trained.
*  If you see a picture of a dog, you hit this left or if the dogs in the right
*  hit the right and you get a treat.
*  So they had some concept of dog because it would be like the whole dog or the dog's head or whatever.
*  So if you have two pictures of like the shape of a cat, the shape of a dog or a cow,
*  they're the same shape. Right.
*  But the dogs knew to choose dog and dogs look very different from each other.
*  So that was something I thought was really fascinating.
*  Well, dogs know what a dog is versus like Marshall hates squirrels, tries to kill squirrels.
*  But when he sees Carl, he knows absolutely even though Carl's squirrel size, that Carl is a dog.
*  Well, Carl's bigger than a squirrel. A lot bigger.
*  When he was little he wasn't.
*  OK. And he knew.
*  How big was Carl when Marshall first saw him?
*  Five pounds.
*  But that could be a smell thing.
*  I think it probably is.
*  The dogs do not smell the same as rodents.
*  It's probably also the way the dog interacts with another dog.
*  And the motion. The way they move.
*  Yeah. There's a difference.
*  The rodents probably smell delicious.
*  But visually, how is it going to know that that's a dog on the screen?
*  How's it going to know that Marshall's never seen a French bulldog?
*  How the fuck did he know?
*  But from smell.
*  Right. But I mean, he's probably like, what is this?
*  This is a crazy thing.
*  But he knows little. He knows little dog.
*  He does. Yeah, that's true.
*  My older dog has a chihuahua.
*  So he's like been around little dogs.
*  But they know that like they know that there's a difference between all kind.
*  Like I had to teach him that he can't kill chickens.
*  It's like chickens are in the fucking.
*  What are these things doing?
*  You know, they are pets.
*  I still don't trust him totally.
*  But he doesn't chase after them and go out.
*  But when he first saw him, he wanted to snap.
*  I'm like, hey, no, no, no, no.
*  These are our friends.
*  Like he's like, what the fuck are you talking about?
*  That was in Call of the Wild, too.
*  Was it? Yeah.
*  Like the dog like killed the chickens and the owners like don't do that.
*  And the dog was safe around them.
*  But at that point, it just showed us what the dog was.
*  You can teach dogs to not do that.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  They just have to know that you will be very upset with them if they do it.
*  And they get in their head and they go, OK, I got it.
*  It's not just that they're upset.
*  They know in group versus out group.
*  So they know to be a guardian like this, something I protect, something I eat.
*  Yes, it's a part of the family.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And he doesn't even know like, bro, you get eggs.
*  These are awesome. Eggs are good for you.
*  Don't kill them. Stupid.
*  For short term gratification, I went to the bathroom once
*  and I just got home and opened the door, let him outside.
*  And I took a leak.
*  And then as I closed the bathroom door and flushed, he has a squirrel in his mouth.
*  I was like, dude, alive.
*  Not anymore. OK.
*  But he just got it.
*  Well, sometimes the dogs will bring you like a living thing that they caught.
*  They're just mouthing it like birds or whatever.
*  He's a hunting. I mean, he's a golden retriever.
*  So are they really hunting?
*  Yeah. They're bird hunting dogs.
*  I thought they're retrievers. That's what retrievers are for.
*  I thought they retrieve it after you've killed it.
*  Yes. Yeah.
*  I mean, you use them in hunting to retrieve.
*  But they go after the animals, too.
*  Like if the animals wounded or whatever, they go after.
*  I got it. OK.
*  But they want to bring it to you.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  He's like his instinct is to bring this fucking.
*  I open up the bathroom door to stand there with a squirrel.
*  I'm proud of himself. Yeah.
*  He got lunch.
*  I don't know what to tell him.
*  I mean, you can't bring it back to life.
*  I'm not going to discourage him from this activity.
*  You let him eat it. No.
*  They do react to videos, though, which wouldn't be smell.
*  Because I've seen Carl even like a lot.
*  That's true.
*  On YouTube, and he started fucking freaking out.
*  Yeah. It's like, what did he?
*  What the fuck did he see? Yeah.
*  If you bark in this room, Carl will go crazy.
*  Is that true? Yeah.
*  We won't do it.
*  But I could do a really good dog.
*  It sounds like I get a low growl
*  and Carl will like pop up.
*  What? I don't want to do it.
*  Because if I do, he was having so much.
*  I was having so much fun with him waiting for it.
*  He's the best. I love Frenchies.
*  I love him so much.
*  Throws himself at you, too.
*  I know he almost got my chin.
*  He leaps to the air to bite you.
*  He's such a little character.
*  They're they're only bred to be fun.
*  Yeah. So if a dog could talk, they're probably annoying.
*  Like, oh, no, give me food. Give me food.
*  Give me food.
*  You'll play with the ball.
*  Not right now, dude. I'm working.
*  How about now? Yeah.
*  And they think your whole day spent going hunting for dog food.
*  Exactly.
*  They think you need to get dog food.
*  That's what they think you're doing all day.
*  You kind of do in a way.
*  It's not all day, but in a way.
*  You have to go fund that stuff.
*  But it's it is weird that like our thoughts of intelligence
*  are based on communication.
*  Like, I wonder if we could decide.
*  So they think they're going to be able to do that with A.I.
*  It's one of the more interesting things about A.I.
*  They think they're going to be able to decipher dolphin languages
*  because we're right right now.
*  We know they talk. We know they have accents.
*  We know they have dialects.
*  We don't know what they're saying.
*  What if they're like really racist against the killer whales?
*  There was a bit on that, like the Spell Show.
*  Really? Yeah. About a dolphin that was racist.
*  Wasn't it Spell Show?
*  Some one of the sketch shows. But.
*  I mean, what are they saying?
*  Well, they're also really horny.
*  Oh, they're not just horny.
*  They're they kill babies so that they make sure the woman keeps breeding.
*  Lines do that, too.
*  So the women fuck as many as the male dolphins as they can,
*  just so that they're protected, because it might be my kid.
*  Who knows? Let's not kill the kid.
*  Yeah. Female lions do that, too. Males. Males.
*  And male cats. Oh, yeah, they kill.
*  They kill the kittens. Yeah.
*  Yeah. But the female lions don't fuck as many males as they can.
*  Right. But dolphins do that because intellectually the dolphin
*  realize, oh, I fucked her. That could be my baby.
*  Wait, no, no. I think female cats can have more than one parent in their litter.
*  Right. Yeah, I think so, too. Yeah.
*  Yeah, this is.
*  It's so interesting.
*  Like, I would wonder if in the absence of human beings,
*  like imagine if something came, some magical switch got popped
*  and human beings disappeared from the face of the earth.
*  I wonder how long it would take for an equally intelligent animal
*  to emerge, if ever.
*  Oh, that's because we haven't been around that long.
*  That's really not this smart.
*  It's been, what, like 50,000 years?
*  If that 100, 200,000 push it back a little more now.
*  And then there's also some new humans they're discovering, like the Denisovans,
*  which I don't think they even discovered them until
*  somewhere in the 2000s.
*  And, you know, we don't we don't even have the full fossil record of human species.
*  If you find something 10 years ago and it's a new kind of human,
*  which the Denisovans are right, like who fucking knows how long we really go back?
*  But I think they think we go back in this form roughly a couple hundred thousand years.
*  Right. That's not that's nothing.
*  It's a blink of an eye.
*  And then the Neanderthals, they lived a lot longer.
*  They were around for like half a million.
*  Were they smarter than us?
*  Not necessarily. We don't know.
*  We know they're a lot stronger than us.
*  Then they ate primarily meat and they were like much more rugged.
*  I thought people who have hired Neanderthal DNA tend to be more intelligent.
*  Yeah, I don't know if that's true.
*  It's interesting.
*  I don't know if that's why either, because sometimes hybrids
*  in parts. Yeah, hybrid vigor.
*  That's the term for it.
*  That could be something along those lines, or it could be like
*  maybe the ones that interbred with Neanderthals
*  like had to become much more intelligent in order to overcome them.
*  Like we would just assume that Neanderthals were brutal.
*  But humans were brutal then, too.
*  Exactly. Humans were brutal.
*  And Neanderthals, like apparently they went after big game
*  and they made weapons and tools.
*  A lot of them had broken bones and they had much more dense bone structure
*  than ours, which only makes sense that they were brutal if they were doing that.
*  So they're probably ruthless in every regard.
*  And we probably had to kill them off.
*  And we probably merged with them in some sort of a way, too.
*  But they think the merging was almost all Neanderthal males
*  and homo sapien females.
*  They think that's because isn't like virtually everyone have a big chunk
*  of Neanderthal DNA. Not everyone.
*  Mostly white European people.
*  OK. Yeah. Africans generally don't.
*  Oh, OK. Yeah.
*  It's it's just interesting that all these different kinds of human existed,
*  along with like that Hobbit man.
*  I was just going to say, yeah.
*  Didn't they find out that he was actually just like a dwarf?
*  No, that was some speculation by some haters.
*  The Hobbit haters.
*  There's some some anthropology haters like you didn't discover this is bullshit.
*  Something gets shot.
*  I think it's pretty much been established
*  because of the amount of bones that they found.
*  This is a very specific animal.
*  OK. And they think that this very also there's a legend of these things.
*  And I think it is Vietnam.
*  They call him the Oren Pendek.
*  And this small, hairy man has been this has been a legend forever.
*  I thought that was supposed to be what the orangutan was based
*  because the orangutan was found fairly recently.
*  Wasn't like the 1840s something crazy?
*  I think gorillas were found in the 1910s.
*  Yes. There's something something.
*  That's interesting.
*  I think the Oren Pendek, though, is an actual little tiny person,
*  little tiny, hairy man.
*  But I think orangutan means hairy man of the forest.
*  Interesting. I think so.
*  Maybe they're related.
*  Maybe it's just like the etymology of the word.
*  Yeah, who knows?
*  But that that little creature, that little hairy creature had been talked about
*  forever and everybody thought it was just bullshit.
*  But everyone has like elves and dwarves.
*  Yeah. You think dragons are real?
*  I had this big argument with my friend, Jesse, not that long ago,
*  because it is whenever here's the thing, when you have
*  every culture on earth having the same kind of myth, it's like
*  there's got to be some starting point.
*  Like something's popped this off. Right.
*  Yeah. And Forrest Galante, who's an actual biologist who studies wildlife.
*  And he actually he's done a lot of work trying to find the Tasmanian tiger.
*  The thylacine.
*  Yes. They're over in Australia trying to find that guy.
*  They're trying to claw him somewhere else.
*  I think they're in New Guinea or somewhere looking for live versions of it.
*  But whatever he thinks it might be a real.
*  There's a whole YouTube video of him describing it on this show.
*  They think dragons were a real thing.
*  But what does this mean?
*  He obviously doesn't mean flying giant lizards.
*  Some large lizard creature, some large, you know,
*  like probably terrifying predator that existed.
*  Maybe a hold. Look, we have crocodiles, right?
*  No, we have a lot of dragons.
*  Or a holdover.
*  And I was watching this video.
*  I'm getting this guy on the podcast soon.
*  But his video is about sightings in the 1800s
*  of crocodiles in the Congo that might have been as many as 50 feet long.
*  OK. Yeah. But it's I mean, those those measurements are so easy to kind of
*  especially scared. Sure. Sure.
*  But they measured it up to the boat that they were on. OK.
*  And there's been a few of them, like one of them, they saw that thing
*  was about 40 feet. They know they found them.
*  I think the biggest one they ever found was like 28 feet.
*  It makes sense that those things, especially back then.
*  Yeah. Look at the size of that fucker.
*  This is the drawing of what it looked like.
*  Yeah, because don't crocodiles keep growing their whole lives.
*  They're alive. Yeah. And they live forever. Yeah.
*  They live forever.
*  So they had one that died of asphyxiation.
*  He died in captivity.
*  And I think he was 28 years long or excuse me, 28 feet long.
*  But I what would a dragon.
*  How would it be like?
*  There's no question there were giant reptiles and they still are on Earth.
*  So what is a dragon going to literally mean?
*  It's not going to have wings, right? Who knows?
*  I mean, it's not going to be a fire had wings.
*  It probably doesn't be a fire.
*  No, that doesn't make any sense. Right.
*  But if you thought about the history of large reptiles on this planet.
*  Look at the Anaconda. Yeah, that's no joke.
*  That's that'll kill you in two seconds.
*  Paul Rosalie told me he was in the Congo and or in the Amazon, rather.
*  And he wrapped his arms around them and he couldn't get his hands touching.
*  Yeah. He's like my size.
*  He couldn't get his arms around it.
*  Think of how big that is, man. That's so insane. Right.
*  He couldn't get his he couldn't touch his hands around a snake. Right.
*  And we know that the megafauna have been driven to extinction.
*  So things used to be bigger. Yeah.
*  There's also some sightings in the Congo back in the, I think, the 1700s
*  or the 1800s of enormous snakes.
*  Snakes are like 100 feet long, like huge snakes.
*  There's never a photograph that someone took of an enormous snake,
*  an old photograph out of an airplane.
*  And they also just recently made forest elephants their own thing.
*  Forest elephants are different.
*  Yeah, they're new species.
*  They recategorize them as a new species now.
*  And pygmy hippos. Oh, yeah.
*  People didn't think they were real.
*  Like, oh, this hippo doesn't live in the water.
*  So this is the photo. Oh, but it's hard to figure out scale.
*  This is from what is it from?
*  It's a fake. Oh, he says it's a fake.
*  No, it's a fake.
*  It's a crop photo of an anaconda, probably one close to 14, 16 feet long,
*  maybe 200 pounds.
*  So this is someone answered it.
*  Oh, so it's one of those perspective things like also like the Loch Ness
*  monster, that famous photo that turned out to be horseshit.
*  And everybody shared it forever.
*  So this is an old grainy photograph from 1950.
*  So that's a fake. Yeah, it looks kind of fake.
*  Now that I'm looking at it, it looks shitty.
*  It looks real, but we don't know.
*  But look, go look at it again.
*  But no, the lines are too clean.
*  The lines around it, like it's too defined.
*  I see what you're saying. The bottom of it.
*  It's like way too defined.
*  Like the snakes, the outline of it looks looks like someone drew it.
*  Like it's a tattoo.
*  It doesn't look like an act like the ground underneath it.
*  Why would it have like shadows like that?
*  But what else is thing is like the colossal squid,
*  which is like the biggest invertebrate, was only discovered in like the 70s.
*  The largest spider was only discovered like 1981.
*  Well, some of those squids, those giant squids, they didn't get
*  photographic evidence of them until fairly recently.
*  Yeah, because they live deep.
*  Sperm whales eat them.
*  You see that nutty one that looks like a crab that they found underneath one of those.
*  It's like a new species that they found under a oil rig.
*  What do you mean?
*  They have this deep, deep camera under an oil rig.
*  And this fucking thing, look at this.
*  Oh, that's a mega.
*  Look at it. Look at its fucking length.
*  It's a squid.
*  Look at it's like crab like tentacles.
*  And they have the elbows.
*  They don't know what they're for.
*  Megapinna, it's called.
*  Look at that fucking thing, man.
*  There's better footage of them.
*  I mean, that is an alien.
*  If that was on another planet, if there was a planet that was filled with only water
*  and we found that would be freaking out.
*  Like, oh, we found alien life.
*  Yeah. It looks like an alien.
*  It is. Yeah.
*  And they don't know why the the the fins are so.
*  Yeah, there it is. Megapinna.
*  The wildest thing to me is octopus.
*  Octopi are so bizarre.
*  They're not like anything else.
*  They they can change their texture and their color.
*  Right. Exactly match what's below them.
*  You know, they put them on like a cuttlefish, too.
*  They put them on like a checkerboard to see what happened.
*  They freak out. Yeah.
*  It does really work.
*  Do you see they have robot cuttlefish now and the male cuttlefish try to fuck them?
*  Whoa. And they changed.
*  And then they changed gender.
*  The male cuttlefish are the little sneaky, like male feminists.
*  There's two. There's the alphas.
*  And then the ones who pass is female.
*  Yeah. And gets them on the side.
*  Yeah. Little male feminists.
*  Yes. They sneak in.
*  Yes. They sneak into the women's room.
*  Yeah. It's like Madaglacias. Yeah.
*  He's one of these shit libs on the Internet.
*  He's like, oh, Biden's not really dementia.
*  It's just the footage. It's like, OK, buddy.
*  Shit libs are awesome.
*  Are they? Yeah.
*  How fun.
*  You should only take their opinion if you go up a giant hill with them.
*  Why? Push them off?
*  Yes. No. See, when you get tired and when you quit.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  What do you have?
*  How much is your opinion worthwhile or how much are you just a weak person?
*  And not just weak physically, weak of spirit.
*  There is a week of will.
*  I this is about a hike.
*  It's like toxic.
*  That's the real toxic masculinity.
*  It's these types with the glasses and the.
*  Oh, it's very toxic because it's the kind of masculinity
*  that attacks stronger masculinity by default.
*  Yes, there's no objective analysis of anything that's strong.
*  There's no there's no acknowledgments of certain merits.
*  And there's no like looking at any positive.
*  It's only negative.
*  Yes, it's negative, which gives rise to guys like Andrew Tate.
*  You know, yeah, like fuck you.
*  They just stick it in your face.
*  Suck my dick.
*  This was a lot of the reasons people over Trump.
*  It was just like, oh, I can't vote for him.
*  Well, fuck you. I am.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  And what?
*  This is the fear that people have of a lot of this,
*  you know, overreach the government has in schools and all these different things.
*  It's going to give rise to like a very hardcore conservative uprising.
*  It's not even I would call it right wing, not conservative.
*  Yeah, it's not conservative.
*  Yeah. Radical right wing. Right.
*  But that's the fear is that things always go like that.
*  If you go so far left, things are going to go so far right to overcorrect.
*  There's going to be a movement.
*  We've known this since time immemorial.
*  If you tell kids you're not allowed to smoke, it's like, oh,
*  now I get to smoke and be a badass or I get you can't have a drink.
*  I get to drink and be a badass.
*  You tell them you can't have these ideas.
*  They're like, oh, yeah, watch me. Now what?
*  Exactly.
*  And it's radicalizing a lot of young people, which I think is wonderful, frankly.
*  Well, it's fascinating because out of rebellion comes some of the coolest shit
*  sometimes, you know, out of rebellion comes some of the coolest ideas,
*  the coolest music, real rebellion.
*  Yes. Resonates with you.
*  It's just sad when you watch those dudes used to be rebels.
*  Well, like like get old and then they just fucking get conformists
*  and tell you go get vaccinated.
*  Yeah, those guys. Yeah.
*  So sad. Real punk is going to do what Pfizer says.
*  So sad. When you get old, though, you get scared.
*  All these kids are going to catch that disease and I'm going to die.
*  You know who the worst one of this is? Who? Stern.
*  I don't know anyone who's fallen as hard as shame as Howard Stern.
*  He was like my guy.
*  He believes all those things he's saying, which is crazy.
*  You think so? Yeah, I believe all the vaccine stuff.
*  Oh, that he believes.
*  But like all those things that you're a fool to not do it.
*  You shouldn't be a part of society.
*  It's unfortunate because it's like I don't know who he's talking to
*  or what conversations he has or what he knows.
*  You know, and I'm not saying that I'm an expert in any way, shape or form.
*  But I had I was very lucky that I had access to a lot of people.
*  You know, Sanjay Gupta, Sanjay Gupta.
*  I had access to a lot of people that explained things to me in a way
*  that I like, oh, oh, I thought, nope.
*  Oh, so how do they get that information?
*  That what? Yeah, that's the rules.
*  And the more you know about that stuff, the more you're going to question these things.
*  Everything in our society, if you if there's a narrative,
*  I guarantee you someone's making money off that narrative,
*  whether it's green energy or whether it's pro vaccine or whatever it is.
*  It's a money thing. It's not a public health thing.
*  It's not they're not really concerned about climate change.
*  They want to make sure that you're concerned about climate change.
*  So you vote so that they can get these fucking things through
*  and they can get more and more control over you.
*  I had Dr. Drew on my show and a big moment for him because he's
*  he's not a Joe Biden doctor. He's a real doctor.
*  He when Covid was hitting, he was asking very basic medical questions
*  because there was this like instant certainty.
*  And Randos were yelling at him on Twitter.
*  And he's like, I went to medical school.
*  I'm not a tinfoil hat, jackass.
*  I'm like, this is just basic medical one on one stuff.
*  And I'm not even saying they're wrong.
*  I'm saying how did you get to this conclusion?
*  Right. Like what's the is it?
*  Are we certain this is the best approach?
*  And the blowback people very forgot how insane that blowback was
*  and how censorious the regime was in terms of, you know, just even just.
*  And here's the thing, if there's an emergency,
*  like let's suppose there's an asteroid hitting the earth.
*  Let's brainstorm.
*  Like, let's OK, what's going to work? Let's try this. Let's try that.
*  Like we got we got an emergency.
*  We're not going to know right away what's going to be the best solution.
*  But the way they were acting was like, no, no, no.
*  This is the only way.
*  I don't care if you have a negative vaccine test.
*  You need to have a negative COVID test.
*  You need to have a vaccination pass that's a year old to get into this restaurant.
*  Makes no sense.
*  The whole thing was very strange.
*  It must have been surreal for you being like the one of the targets.
*  Oh, yeah, it was very weird.
*  It was what it was also so weird because the thing that they were targeting
*  me on was so dumb.
*  It was so I listed a list of things.
*  I watched it and they all went after this one thing like, boy, that seems odd.
*  Here's the way they you remember how they went after it.
*  They went after it as if Joe Rogan goes to Petco, right?
*  And you wore like a Dave Smith disguise.
*  So no one recognized you.
*  And you grab the horse pace and you inject it yourself.
*  So inject it is hilarious.
*  That's kind of like what the impression was.
*  Right. It's like worst case scenario, your quack doctor told you to do this.
*  Right. Worst case scenario.
*  But what's really crazy is that they did it with that particular drug.
*  Right. The knowing the history of that drug, the fact that guy won
*  the Nobel Prize on it for humans, knowing the fact that it had been given to
*  billions, billions of prescriptions had been filled.
*  And here's the thing, if they cared about being honest and saving lives,
*  there would have been consequences.
*  And there were no consequences for any of these people.
*  And then you clouting Sandra Gupta in this chair.
*  Well, there's also should be an understanding of why a person
*  got through it easy and why some people don't. Right.
*  Yeah, because I'm not that young.
*  I got to ask you. I got to ask you. I got to ask.
*  OK, let's get our tinfoil more tinfoil hats.
*  Do you do do do do?
*  Do you think Biden really had covid last week?
*  Two weeks ago, it made him grow.
*  If you get it when you're 81, you grow.
*  It's called grovid.
*  Maybe I got to go.
*  Hey, maybe we should get some of that shit.
*  I wish I know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know what to believe anymore.
*  I know it's it's so hard when you saw the letter that was written.
*  It didn't have the presidential seal on it.
*  Right. And it wasn't his signature. No.
*  So there's that.
*  And then there's no video of him saying that until far later.
*  Why would they even test them for it?
*  Like if he had symptoms like it, you would think it's the flu.
*  Let's treat him like the flu.
*  It's a good thing to say.
*  Say he's got covid like, oh, he wasn't wearing a mask.
*  Shut it down.
*  And this idea of covid where you can't go on screen.
*  Shut it down.
*  He's got the covid.
*  He's going to give it to you through the screen.
*  Well, also, it's like if you're 81, you get covid.
*  You're not. It's not looking so good for you.
*  Like you're like, I don't care if you're the president or somebody else.
*  Like it's a bad scene.
*  I read something again.
*  Reddit might not be real, but they had given them 10 doses of paxlovid.
*  And then one of my friends was a doctor was like,
*  that is way more than you're supposed to use someone.
*  Like, why would they give him that?
*  Find out if that's true, because that might have just been some.
*  Here's the thing.
*  We're dealing with so much misinformation, so many trolls, so much bullshit.
*  It's so hard.
*  Six dose of paxlovid on Saturday.
*  And according to his doctor, he's improving steadily.
*  Biden, 81, tested positive for covid 19 while campaigning in Las Vegas on Wednesday.
*  He self isolated his home in Delaware while receiving the oral antiviral pill.
*  How many are you supposed to take of those?
*  Six doses.
*  That seems like a lot.
*  What is the side effects of paxlovid?
*  Does it have any side effects?
*  You turn your wife into a selfish, silly, entitled cunt.
*  Only according to your son.
*  The rest of my favorite video was one after the debate.
*  You answered all the questions.
*  You did great, Joe.
*  He's like, yeah, he's gone.
*  We've all seen a guy like that.
*  If you live long enough and you have grandparents or you have friends,
*  grandparents, you're going to see someone like that.
*  This is the end.
*  And when she's talking to him and like she's got power for the first time.
*  Yes, that's what I was saying.
*  She's doing talking at like speeches and stuff.
*  She's up there talking.
*  It was like misery.
*  She was Kathy Bates.
*  Oh, my God.
*  She's like, I've got you in my house.
*  You're staying here.
*  Here's the other thing that's funny.
*  How badly do you have to fuck up a debate to lose your house and your job?
*  Like that is, I think, historically unprecedented.
*  How do you lose his house?
*  He's getting kicked out of the White House.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Please still. He's allowed to be there to the end.
*  Yeah, but the allegedly tall guy, they're not renewing the lease.
*  Once he got taller, I think he's going to change things.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Because on these new drugs, he's going to he's going to say, listen, guys,
*  give me another chance at this.
*  This stuff that made me grow six inches.
*  Like, I fucking got it, man.
*  Not only do I got it, I think I'm better than I've ever been before.
*  I you know, I sent away for this drug that would grow me by six inches.
*  And it was a fraud.
*  I'm still at four.
*  Well, you can get those things done where they break your leg and stretch you out.
*  There was a guy called what was his name?
*  He deleted his Instagram.
*  He was like this power lifter.
*  Oh, I saw that guy. Yeah.
*  Did he delete it? Yeah.
*  Probably got tired of people shitting on him.
*  Yeah, it was he was a giant guy already.
*  Yeah. He was like, what, 280, 62.
*  Yeah. He wanted to be.
*  And he and he thought he was small.
*  So he got his legs. That's by dysmorphia.
*  And he was away from his family for like a year.
*  Oh, my God. Got my knees done.
*  Was that his? Yeah.
*  Yes, yes, yes.
*  Yeah, that's crazy.
*  There's a lot of people that have done that.
*  They've got their legs and even their arms.
*  They've got their arms lengthened.
*  Well, if you're going to get the legs, otherwise you look like a penguin, right?
*  You look weird unless you were a dude with like crazy long arms.
*  And isn't it?
*  Isn't it the thing?
*  Well, you can't ever walk.
*  You can't run anymore.
*  No, we thought that, too.
*  We can. There was a guy that Jamie found that got it done.
*  OK. And he shows the difference.
*  And then you see him sprinting.
*  And that man's name is Joe Biden.
*  Yeah. It's so quick.
*  He grew six inches in a week.
*  This new one they have is just way better.
*  It's just a pill.
*  It's Pax Lovett.
*  Six doses, six inches.
*  Imagine if it cures covid, but you grow an inch.
*  I should be like, I got covid.
*  The Joe Rogan experience.
*  Sponsor of Pax Lovett.
*  It'll get you taller.
*  Forget that horse face.
*  At the end of the fucking five seasons from how my head scraped on the ceiling.
*  Become a freak like that guy, that famous guy from the you know,
*  that guy from the 1970s that was like a beautiful, handsome man.
*  And then he kept injecting stuff into his face.
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Hold on.
*  I'll send it because I sent it to Tom Segura.
*  Me and Tom Segura send each other the most horrific shit that we can find.
*  I get Boomer memes from you.
*  Yeah, those are fun.
*  They are fun.
*  I'm sitting here like Joe Rogan is just texting me a Boomer meme.
*  I send you if I can get a smile on Michael Maas's face.
*  I'm serious.
*  I got to find this dude.
*  I send Tommy so much shit.
*  We send each other so much shit.
*  Our feed is just a gross disaster.
*  Oh, this is the old Tom Segura.
*  Oh, my God. He's got a new phone number.
*  The best one.
*  The one of the best texts I ever got.
*  I got a text from Rosanna said WTF with two question marks.
*  And I thought, OK, she's a boomer.
*  She sees something on her screen.
*  She thinks I could see it, too.
*  And like, what do you mean?
*  She goes, you don't call me like what's going on with you?
*  I'm worried. It was so sweet.
*  All right. Here it is.
*  Jamie, I'll send it to you.
*  I don't know what the fuck this guy was doing.
*  I guess this is all.
*  Why is this not?
*  Here we go.
*  I just sent it, Jamie.
*  So this is what he well, I want you to see the whole thing,
*  OK, because it starts out in 1969.
*  He's gorgeous, man, like beautiful, handsome man.
*  And then over time, homeboy goes crazy.
*  Go full screen so we could see like, oh,
*  so nice and beautiful, handsome man.
*  Now it's getting a little weird in 88.
*  But I think that's just age.
*  That's 91. That's just age.
*  Just age now.
*  Oh, these are getting weird.
*  Oh, no. This is the beginning.
*  Oh, I know this guy.
*  2004. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Now it gets crazy. Look at the chin.
*  Something's going nutty.
*  Now the cheeks.
*  But he's trying to avoid the wrinkles.
*  So he's turning his face in a fucking balloon.
*  And I guess it's just body dysmorphia now 2010.
*  But it gets a little real crazy.
*  Now he's done his lips.
*  2013, it starts getting real crazy.
*  Look at that 2015.
*  I mean, now it's just nuts.
*  Now it looks like you got attacked by a swarm of bees.
*  That's got to be a wig or something.
*  Something. Look at that.
*  I mean, Jesus Christ.
*  And it gets worse.
*  So the head keeps getting bigger.
*  Look at 2019.
*  I mean, that's just absolutely insane.
*  Now, look at it.
*  Now, if that guy just let himself age,
*  he would just be an old, good looking guy.
*  But instead, he went nutty
*  because that's body dysmorphia,
*  where people can't see what they look like.
*  Yeah, I had my dysmorphia.
*  I got not to not facially, but body.
*  And it's gone away.
*  Do you know what? You know what stopped it?
*  I'm not even kidding.
*  I've talked to you about this a little bit.
*  A few things did it.
*  But this was like the moment where I was like, OK, this is done.
*  I was at Gold's.
*  And there was a young dude there, early 20s, I'd say,
*  who had striated delts.
*  And I was like, wow, that's so cool.
*  And then my brain said to myself, I swear to God, this I go,
*  you were just at the Tesla factory at two in the morning
*  with Joe Rogan, Elon Musk and Jordan Peterson.
*  And you go tell that kid that you think you're jealous of his stride adults.
*  And he will look at you like you're a crazy person.
*  And that was when it clicked like, holy shit, this is fucking insane.
*  No one cares about your fucking stride adults.
*  Except your girlfriend.
*  They don't care. You don't think so?
*  They don't fucking care. No, they think it's gross.
*  Really? Yes. Girls, you banging?
*  They don't like that muscle, that bodybuilder build at all.
*  What do they like? When we were at Chris Helmsworth,
*  when we were thinly or fat over.
*  Do you know what else it was?
*  When we were at the mothership opening night, this guy came in
*  and I've met him since I don't remember his name.
*  He was a bodybuilder, like in his 50s.
*  The chillest dude, really nice, very friendly, no attitude.
*  I'm sure you know who I'm talking about.
*  I can't remember his name. His name is Chris, maybe.
*  Immediately, everyone in the room is like this guy's outgroup outsider.
*  It wasn't like this guy's cool.
*  It was like he's not one of us.
*  And I saw the energy change and like, holy shit,
*  if this was something people thought was awesome,
*  everyone be treating him very differently.
*  Well, it depends on the group.
*  Of course, it depends on the group.
*  But this was the normal people don't look at.
*  They look at that as freakish, not as admirable.
*  Like when girls have those huge implants at a certain point, it's not hot.
*  It's just like there's something wrong with you.
*  Right. You went crazy. You went crazy.
*  Yeah. And that's what happened. That guy's face went crazy.
*  But isn't it interesting that there's something wrong with us
*  where we can't see what we really look like?
*  We can't we can't perspective is very difficult to acquire.
*  When you when you're in the middle of that when you're in the illness,
*  when you realize like, holy shit, my brain is lying to itself.
*  It's very scary.
*  Oh, it must be when you look in the mirror and you see your face,
*  you're like, oh, my God, him.
*  I don't know. What does he see?
*  Who knows, man?
*  And I think once you've got to that point, like, what are you going to do?
*  You're going to get it removed.
*  Well, then it becomes your thing. Right.
*  Well, I don't know.
*  You're the guy that guy. Oh, God damn.
*  Because could have just got a freeze lift, buddy.
*  Yeah. Get fucking crazy.
*  What's her name? Just something.
*  They're twins. So you were seeing maybe both of them during that.
*  Oh, yeah. Well, they both do it.
*  They both have the same thing.
*  They both have the same issue.
*  What about Matt Gaetz?
*  Was Matt Gaetz the congressman?
*  Oh, yeah, he did his eyebrows.
*  Not just he got cheek.
*  He got something with the cheek, too. Oh, did he?
*  Yes. Yeah.
*  You can't do that if you're a public person.
*  And all of a sudden, your eyebrows are like a dude.
*  A 45 year old housewife.
*  It was from. Yeah.
*  He looked like a real housewife.
*  Yeah. Like Miami. Yeah.
*  He's got a frozen forehead.
*  It was no, but the cheek implants and I don't know if it's fillers.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  His implants are fillers. It was something nuts.
*  Isn't it crazy to.
*  And I thought it was Photoshop.
*  A politician, like your wrinkles and your the weathered look on your face
*  is actually good for your career.
*  No, it isn't. You don't think so?
*  No. Oh, I think so.
*  I think if you look at a guy like RFK, the voice is a problem.
*  But the way he looks, the fact that he's this like intelligent,
*  worldly guy that's like seen a lot, had a lot of life.
*  You don't want a smooth faced dude.
*  Yeah, that's crazy.
*  That is. That's cheekbone stuff. Come on.
*  Yeah, that's I think.
*  And that nose too looks.
*  Well, it's hard to tell because it's a different angle.
*  But there's definitely that's not a natural nose.
*  And I should know.
*  You might be right.
*  Wow. But the the forehead and the eyebrows are crazy.
*  The OK, maybe the nose is natural from that angle.
*  I could be wrong. But that's that is a crazy look.
*  That's a crazy look.
*  But the thing is, like, he used to be like the chubby kid.
*  So I'm sure his head.
*  He's still always going to be that chubby slob kid.
*  Even though he looked fine before. Yeah.
*  But it's again with like these
*  with these bodybuilds, it wasn't going to get bigger.
*  They're never happy with like, dude, you hit 240.
*  Just like you're fine.
*  You know how we could save society?
*  We should have by electing Connolly Harris as president.
*  And then have a reality show where all the congresspeople
*  have cameras that follow them all and get to know the real them.
*  Oh, well, that's called deep. See him in their house.
*  Right. Except that's not a reality show.
*  Julia Louis-Dreyfus blocked me because she was saying, go, go and vote.
*  And I go, you won five Emmys for showing that politicians are all sociopaths.
*  Blocked. But it's yeah.
*  But I don't blame her. But it's true. It is true.
*  But is you don't blame her that she blocked you?
*  I don't blame her. Really?
*  I block people very liberally.
*  Like, I'm not. Yeah, I don't.
*  You just block people. Yes, of course.
*  Fuck them. Well, I don't.
*  I'm not there to be annoyed. Right.
*  They can disagree with me. That's fine.
*  But if you're going to be playing gotcha games, I don't know.
*  I don't hear it. Blocked. Blocked.
*  That's Lex Lex is a blocking fool.
*  Lex Lex. He's worse than me.
*  All my people. Can you get Lex to unblock me?
*  I'm like, yes.
*  Wants positive interactions only.
*  I which is fine.
*  I mean, but it's not the Internet.
*  I mean, but I guess you could cultivate a place where you only have positive
*  influences or you could have negative in the sense of respectful or negative.
*  And like, right.
*  Or like it.
*  The thing is with the Internet, whenever there's a question mark,
*  it instantly becomes like an improv show.
*  And like as any improv show, it's it's just torture.
*  It's just like it like these are not funny.
*  Like everyone says the same stupid lines. It's it's it's rough.
*  And the don't get me started. The boomers. My God.
*  What do you mean by a question mark?
*  Like if I say, is it just me or is it blah, blah, blah?
*  Or like what?
*  Why is my body at my age still making you farts?
*  And the things that they reply, some of them are going to be very funny
*  because it's farts.
*  Some of them is just going to be like, oh, my God, just relax.
*  And so I avoid question marks as much as possible.
*  There's a lot of very angry people out there in the world.
*  Yeah, no shit.
*  And they love to express themselves in this very strange way on on social media.
*  It's a strange way to interact with people.
*  And they love it.
*  I do. Like if I go to someone's feed and all their comments are just hostility,
*  you suck. Fuck you. You've got to block those people.
*  You don't want that energy around you.
*  Yeah, you don't want it.
*  And it's not how many of those people are even real people.
*  There's a few of those.
*  There's a lot of real people like that. Come on. 100 percent.
*  But there's also any time there's a politically charged issue
*  or a person who's engaging in politically charged issues like you do.
*  You're going to have a bunch of bots that are attacking you
*  and a bunch of bots on your page, a bunch of people that aren't real people.
*  There's a lot of them. I'm sure you're aware.
*  I thought that that was nonsense.
*  And it's not. And I've seen enough receipts that it's like, holy shit, this really is a thing.
*  Well, you know, that FBI guy, the former FBI analyst who said that he estimated
*  it's somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 percent of all accounts on Twitter were bots.
*  80 80, eight zero. Holy crap.
*  Yeah. I don't know if he's right, but I know that they wouldn't
*  they wouldn't supply Elon with the information necessary for him to
*  find out whether or not it's more than five, which is what they were claiming.
*  They're claiming somewhere in the neighborhood.
*  But he said they based that on like 100 accounts, like a random one.
*  So that's do small of a sample size.
*  But 80 still FBI agent firms, Elon Musk claim of under counting
*  bot accounts on Twitter by conducting his own research.
*  So what his estimation was 80 percent, I believe.
*  Was it say where it says it? Yeah, right there.
*  Right at the top, Jamie.
*  Oh, here it goes.
*  When I consider the volume and velocity of automation we're seeing today,
*  the sophistication of bots that a given set of incentives is likely to attract
*  and the relative lack of countermeasures I saw in my own research.
*  I can only come to one conclusion.
*  All likelihood, more than 80 percent of Twitter accounts are actually bots.
*  This, of course, is my opinion.
*  But I mean, there are bots where, like, if you reply something,
*  all the replies will be like, oh, check out Bitcoin, blah, blah, blah. Sure.
*  But then there's also those more sophisticated bots.
*  Yeah. Where like if you're going to go after Trump or after Biden,
*  they're going to swarm you and be like, actually, blah, blah, blah.
*  Yeah, 100 percent.
*  And I bet all the candidates use them.
*  I mean, I bet it's just I bet it's legal right now.
*  I mean, I don't know.
*  I mean, it's essentially propaganda, right?
*  But they have live bots made out of meat.
*  You have people like Brooklyn Dad and what's their system.
*  They're bots. Right.
*  Essentially. What's that girl Jojo, whatever her name is.
*  So how does that work? Are those people paid? Yes.
*  Who pays them?
*  They see the DNC or the campaigns.
*  We have the receipts for these people.
*  It's not just by the way, it's not at all just the Democrats.
*  There's Republican operatives as well. Let's make that very clear.
*  Oh, 100 percent.
*  I have a friend who has a Republican Instagram page,
*  and he reached out to me to tell me that people were contacting him,
*  asking him to do videos and that if he did those videos, they'd pay him money.
*  There's like thousands of dollars.
*  I want that. Like, give me that goo.
*  Like you can get that goo. I'm for sale. Oh, good. Yes.
*  It's good to know, because I've been talking to some people
*  and I was going to breach this with you, but I'm glad you brought it up on your own.
*  Perfect. That.
*  Well, how much do you charge to lie?
*  Oh, lying. I do for free.
*  It costs money for you to tell the truth.
*  But propaganda, if you want to be a bot,
*  like who would you be a bot for? The libertarians?
*  God, are you kidding? No.
*  Anarchy. Who would I be a bot for?
*  You know who I'd be a bot for? Who?
*  Betterman. I kind of like him.
*  I love him. I like him now.
*  I used to think, why doesn't that guy? I donate to his campaign.
*  I used to think, why doesn't that guy put a suit on?
*  Then I realized, why don't I put a suit on?
*  Exactly. You know, I have this fucking huge podcast and I wear hoodies.
*  He wears hoodies. His whole point is. He's my people.
*  I shouldn't be taken seriously just because I'm a senator.
*  And I got to tell you, for me to say something positive, a politician takes a lot.
*  The barrier is so low for someone to go on public record
*  and talk about his mental health problems that could help a lot of people.
*  And I thought it was very commendable of him to do that.
*  Also, watching him bounce back from his stroke.
*  I know. I thought the dude was toast.
*  Yes, we all did. Right.
*  Because when you stumble with words that bad and you struggle with thinking that bad,
*  but it was just post stroke.
*  But then here we are.
*  What is it like at least two years later? Yeah.
*  Two years after 22. Yeah.
*  Seems fine and reasonable.
*  And like saying a lot of stuff that he's like, I'm a progressive.
*  This is not what I stand for.
*  No, he said I'm not a progressive anymore. Right.
*  He used to be. And he was to be what a progressive.
*  What he thought of.
*  Yeah, he was the first one to tell Menendez to resign.
*  And now Menendez is resigning from his own party.
*  So I love him.
*  By the way, Senator Federman, if you want to join with me
*  in your remake of Twins, I'm totally down.
*  Do you think that guy would ever run for president? I hope so.
*  See, he's a reasonable, like he'd win in two seconds.
*  Left wing person.
*  He's reasonable. He's a moderate.
*  Right. But would they ever let a guy like that even get close?
*  Like would they? Tulsi Gabbard him.
*  Well, Tulsi was it was only a congresswoman from Hawaii.
*  She didn't have a big right.
*  And she ran against a governor. Right.
*  And when Bernie was her guy and she ran against him,
*  metals with Warrens, they're splitting that ticket three that base three ways.
*  I think he'd have a great shot, don't you? I do. I do now.
*  But getting past the primary would be tough because the machine wouldn't like him
*  because he's not reliable.
*  Biden was reliable. He's a party hack.
*  And he would do speeches with a hoodie on. Yeah.
*  This guy is outrageous. Is it outrageous? No.
*  His whole point is we work for you. Yes.
*  No, no. He's very reasonable.
*  I'm shocked because I used to make fun of him.
*  I used to think like, this is so crazy that this guy can't talk
*  and he's going to run for governor.
*  And then he won. I was like, oh, well, that's but he won against Dr. Oz.
*  Who's the worst? Well, you know, the guy got brought up
*  in front of Congress for making fake weight loss claims.
*  You don't go from supporting Jesse Smollett to being a Trump supporter.
*  Right. You're a complete phony and a clown.
*  And what was even funnier was when Oprah came out and twisted the knife
*  and endorsed Federman at the last minute.
*  Do you remember that? Oh, and he was her boy.
*  Oh, wow. Yeah. Interesting.
*  Oprah did that. Oh, yes, she did.
*  Federman now. I wonder how many people that endorsed him back then
*  will endorse him now that he's like outside of the.
*  I don't think he got many endorsements.
*  But I mean, how many people that were like OK with him?
*  Or still, you know, yes, if he's speaking the way he's speaking
*  and talking about these issues, you know what?
*  What could make it happen? What?
*  If Trump wins again, there's going to be a lot of soul
*  searching in the Democratic Party about like, hey, where we lose track
*  that we're losing to who they perceive as this complete putz.
*  And that would be an opportunity for someone like Federman,
*  like it was for Clinton in 92 to be like, OK, I'm going to steer this party
*  back to where middle America is. Right.
*  And we could win on that. Those terms.
*  If they were going to do that, wouldn't they have done that
*  after Trump's first term and said they ran with Biden?
*  Well, they could have.
*  They didn't do that for Trump's first term because first of all, Hillary
*  got millions more votes.
*  Second of all, they were too busy losing their minds to think strategically.
*  This would be a little different.
*  I mean, after after so but after they ran with Biden,
*  there was plenty of like young enthusiastic people they could have ran with.
*  Yeah, but I think Biden for them, you knew he was safe.
*  He's a safe Democratic vote.
*  You know, he's going to say he's going to play the party game
*  and he's kind of tried and tested.
*  Also, he knows how Washington works.
*  It's kind of like when those things are.
*  It's hard to hate him.
*  It's hard. Yeah, it's hard to hate him because he's just a sad old man
*  in a basement.
*  Mm hmm. It's going to be a lot.
*  It was a lot easier.
*  I don't think it would have been as easy to put over Klobuchar or Buttigieg.
*  They certainly don't want Sanders because he'd be a loose cannon.
*  Yeah, they didn't want Sanders at all costs.
*  But I don't believe Buttigieg would work either.
*  He says a lot of salad.
*  Yeah, he's a kid.
*  Like you don't come from South Bend to.
*  First of all, he also here's another reason why I think she's in trouble.
*  Officer Harris Buttigieg raised more money than her.
*  Yeah, how do you think they're all just going to get behind her?
*  No, no, I do.
*  But my point is how if you in when you're running for president in 2020,
*  can't raise as much money as a senator from California.
*  Right. As the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, your Rolodex is not good.
*  Right. But that is just trying to get through the primaries.
*  Sure. But they weaseled her in there.
*  Right. She horned her right in, which was always the fear
*  when Biden was elected president.
*  Yeah. But hey, if anything happens to him, look, I don't think it's a given
*  that the people are going to write the checks for her that they would have done.
*  Is it said and done that she's going to be the candidate for president?
*  No, it's not the convention.
*  She has enough delegates as of right now.
*  But Harris raised 200 million.
*  Now, do you know how that works, though?
*  Here's what's interesting about that.
*  Do you know what astroturfing is? Yes, of course.
*  Yeah. So explain to people how they do that.
*  Well, there's different ways to do astroturfing.
*  But one of the things they do is they attribute
*  the attribute donations to people that didn't really donate them.
*  But it's not only that, it's that there's no question that a lot of these donors
*  led thanks to James Carville, who was a Democratic strategist for many, many years.
*  James Carville said, hold your donations if Biden's a nominee.
*  That's the only pressure you have.
*  And they did. The donations trickled to a zero.
*  And that's one of the reasons Pelosi and the others freaked out.
*  Once they switch, they're ready to write those checks again.
*  The question is, it's July.
*  Are you going to be able to sustain this fundraising through November?
*  And I don't know that she will because she didn't last time.
*  OK, so there's no one more thing.
*  There's no question that whoever is the nominee of either party
*  is going to get a fuck ton of money. That's not in dispute.
*  The question is, is she going to be as good as a Hillary?
*  Who had the Rolodex, the favors?
*  It's my turn. She had Wall Street.
*  She had body count.
*  She had what? Wall Street.
*  She had Hollywood. She had DC.
*  She had everybody. Kamala Harris.
*  No one likes her.
*  That's a big difference.
*  But then people don't like Trump either.
*  So that's a big problem for him.
*  So how could it work that they would get rid of her?
*  How would that possibly happen?
*  You mean publicly or privately?
*  All the above, because it seems like privately you'd have to blackmail.
*  You have to sit her down and be like, here's what's going to happen.
*  If you don't drop down yourself, then we're going to do X, Y and Z.
*  But she's already said she's running.
*  But she could.
*  OK, I mean, who knows what they got on her?
*  Did you not see the phone call she had with the Obamas?
*  It was amazing. It was so candid.
*  It definitely wasn't planned at all.
*  Yeah, just they happened to have a camera on her
*  while she got a phone call from the Obamas.
*  It was beautiful.
*  I am surprised how quickly they flipped the candidate
*  without any pretense of having some kind of competition.
*  Well, I think they were feeling like they couldn't win.
*  You know, but the point is, I'm shocked that they went immediately with her as Plan B.
*  Because she is the one that is in the administration now,
*  which means all the people that have jobs keep their jobs.
*  So they're all very motivated.
*  That's not what that means.
*  Doesn't? Well, she could get rid of some of them.
*  That's what happened with when Lyndon Johnson took over,
*  when George Bush took over for Reagan.
*  They clean house.
*  They bring in the wrong guys, of course.
*  You think she would do that?
*  Are you kidding? She would make it look like a Benetton ad.
*  She's the nominee from Netflix.
*  Like, she's going to make it all, you know, DEI.
*  Who could possibly take over?
*  Like, how would they do that?
*  They would have to.
*  They would have had to have forced her not to declare,
*  which would have been a very tough move, because if she's not the nominee now,
*  here's the here's my 40 chest.
*  OK, 40 chest with Michael Maus.
*  Biden is like, all right, we put her up.
*  We know she's going to lose.
*  She can't go back to the she's not going to be governor of California.
*  She's not going to be senator.
*  Her career is done.
*  And that was his kind of legacy, like, you know, getting rid of her
*  once and for all, because otherwise she's going to be the nominee
*  or a very strong case for it in twenty twenty eight.
*  Right. But don't you think that if she runs in twenty twenty four,
*  that's very likely there's a possibility like more than fifty fifty that she wins?
*  I don't think it's more than fifty fifty.
*  Oh, interesting. I do.
*  I don't think it's more than fifty fifty.
*  I think there's so many people that are opposed to the idea of Trump.
*  That's true.
*  Quiet people, quiet people, they're quiet.
*  They're not like the Trump people are loud like the in support of Trump.
*  They go to the rallies.
*  They fill up stadiums.
*  And so people in their head, they go, oh, he's more popular.
*  But the people that are not willing to vote for him, they're on the quiet tip.
*  And they're there.
*  They might talk amongst their friends and they might talk at work and they might.
*  But they're not going to these rallies.
*  She didn't even make Iowa last time.
*  The last time. So we got us three months of her.
*  This is a woman who cracks herself up
*  because she sees a school bus and goes, the wheels of the bus go around and round.
*  You know, you didn't just fall off a coconut tree.
*  Do you know? Yeah, her mom says, Kamala, you did not just fall off a coconut tree.
*  You exist in the context of.
*  Yeah. So I think this is going to be.
*  And here's the other thing.
*  How is it you're going up for that debate?
*  And when Tulsi hits you with your record, you don't have a counterpunch ready.
*  That makes no sense.
*  She didn't have to. She knew they were going to bury it.
*  But she she they didn't bury it and it ruined her.
*  It ruined her career. Ruined her campaign.
*  I think at the time she thought they were going to bury it.
*  Well, yeah, we're going to we're going to bring it up.
*  I mean, there was a lot of people that were very high on her.
*  They thought she was going to be the one that's true.
*  Yeah. And they were wrong.
*  But maybe they're right now.
*  But they thought that about Biden, too.
*  Remember back in the day, we got busted for plagiarism in 88.
*  He was never the guy.
*  But he was running for president.
*  Sure. No, I mean, Delaware.
*  But again, just like they took her out, they took him out.
*  He came back and became president.
*  Yeah. Like what? 20 years later.
*  Yeah. But 40 years accelerated.
*  40 years is four years now.
*  Plus, she's got the experience, international experience
*  of being the vice president of the United States and never the border czar.
*  That never happened.
*  That never happened.
*  You're crazy. The fact that people say she was the border czar, newly appointed.
*  The Republicans made that up and had a time machine.
*  It's a cheap fake.
*  Those are cheap fakes. Yeah.
*  It's just it's a wild time.
*  And most people don't even the average person
*  that's going about their job and occasionally watching the news
*  and occasionally paying attention to the news feed on their phone.
*  They have no idea what's going on, how nutty it all is.
*  Yes. But but until they do, it's like gradually.
*  Then suddenly, like with the Biden debate, if the corporate comedians had done
*  like Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel and all the other John Stewart's other bastard
*  children had done their job and made fun of Biden for four years
*  about being an old fart, that debate wouldn't have landed as hard as it did.
*  The fact that it was a complete 180 for what we were being told
*  is what really did him in.
*  So the more they're trying to hype her up now, and of course, she's the new nominee.
*  She's the greatest thing that's ever happened.
*  She's basically another Oprah.
*  Once she starts opening her mouth and once here's the thing that's going to I predict
*  she's notoriously difficult to work for.
*  The New York Times, New York Post covered this at the time.
*  Wait until people who are trying to get her into the White House
*  start leaking to the press.
*  And what a nightmare she is to work with.
*  That is going to undermine a lot of stuff for her to be in the set.
*  She's not she's not like Hillary.
*  Everyone's Linda was named Linda Bloodworth went to jail for Hillary.
*  People ride or die with her.
*  Common was a different story.
*  Well, she had a really high turnover of her staff.
*  90 percent.
*  That's great. What's normal?
*  I don't know, but it's not 90 in like a year.
*  Yeah. It's not just that they left,
*  it's that they left and went to the press and be like, I can't.
*  She doesn't do her homework.
*  And then she yells at me for not being prepared.
*  Like they went leaked.
*  People leave these offices all the time, but they don't leak.
*  But it's just so wild that the media is all behind her now.
*  Why is it wild? Because it's interesting.
*  It's just wild to see. It's like 80. Yeah.
*  The shamelessness. It's wild to see.
*  Yeah. But what's even wilder is seeing it through Twitter.
*  Yeah, because you see their 180 switch and then people like you guys
*  were just saying something different two weeks ago.
*  Yeah, it's hilarious. Thank you, Ilan again.
*  Yeah. Oh, my God. Thank you, Ilan.
*  Because if it wasn't for him, first of all, he changes the watermark.
*  Yes. For all the other ones, the things that all the other social
*  media companies would have blocked you for.
*  More stuff is slipping through the cracks. Right.
*  It's less people are getting banned, I think, in these other social media
*  networks, because it's just it highlights.
*  And in their defense, broadly speaking, what's the point of me banning this person
*  if they're going to be in these other nine sites or one other site?
*  Then it's not actually accomplishing the purpose.
*  It's just a waste of time.
*  And I'm alienating potential subscribers or users.
*  Yeah, it's wild, man.
*  It's a strange, strange time.
*  Again, it's like the Coliseum people.
*  But do you know what's even funnier is that.
*  Blue pill people on the left have been told and believe
*  that Trump is scared to debate her.
*  Yeah, that's funny. They think this.
*  You really think they think that?
*  Yes. No, they don't have thoughts, but that's what they say.
*  They think that because she's young.
*  No, because she's a she's a prosecutor and she's tough.
*  Yeah, tough. Hashtag girl boss.
*  Yeah. And she's a prosecutor and he's a crook.
*  So she's going to put him in his place and everyone will clap.
*  That's going to be interesting if they do debate.
*  They're going to do debate. Several. If he lives.
*  Yeah. Do you think they're going to try to take him out again?
*  Yes. Yeah, I do, too.
*  Yes. I think if they did that, this is not the only time they're going to do that.
*  And then also, that one was so Lee Harvey Oswald.
*  It was so it was so perfect lone gunmen at a certain time.
*  Now, if you're that sloppy, you're in on it.
*  Someone had at least know that he was under threat or didn't care.
*  They didn't care. Yeah, that's the thing.
*  I don't think that literally they worked with this crooks kid at all.
*  You don't think so? I don't think so.
*  What about the data that shows that someone from the near the FBI office
*  in D.C. was visiting this kid being on their radar screen is not the same
*  as like colluding with him, meeting with him.
*  Right. I don't know that them checking him out is the same thing as he's working.
*  Because if he was, why would they check him out?
*  Maybe who knows why?
*  There's lots of reasons to check somebody out.
*  Point B, working for the government right now.
*  Yes, obviously. Do you already get paid?
*  I'm a side. Yeah, I get paid my shot.
*  Yes, you did.
*  No, I gave you the briefcase.
*  I didn't know. I didn't know. But I was scared.
*  Point being, if you I think they just didn't didn't care. Right.
*  And if it's your job to protect someone's life
*  and you don't really care. Right.
*  At a certain point, something's going to happen.
*  The whole thing was very strange.
*  It's just very strange.
*  It's also past and it's also black water commercial.
*  And yeah. And also the idea that, again, the media is like, yeah, whatever.
*  Yeah, it's fine.
*  Yeah. Well, it's also the news cycle today.
*  It's so rapid.
*  It's like working on assembly line, like you don't have time to check parts.
*  You put that fucker on is another one coming.
*  They were talking about the debate for weeks.
*  Mm hmm. True.
*  And they were not talking about this like they were talking about the debate.
*  Do you think that they set him up?
*  They knew that Biden was compromised and they let him debate on purpose.
*  No, you don't think because it could have said no debate.
*  No, because I think first of all, I think again, he's fine.
*  The State of the Union, he probably has good days and bad days.
*  And even the bad days, that is probably exceptionally bad.
*  And I think he has his people.
*  I'm the president, Joe Biden, who is going to tell Jill?
*  No, I think at a certain point you believe you're on bullshit, don't you?
*  Mm hmm. Could be. Yeah.
*  I always wonder because it was so early, though.
*  But in their head, Trump, in their head, we're going to put a nail in the trunk
*  coffin once and for all.
*  The guys, Hitler and a liar and all this other nonsense that they believe.
*  So Joe's going to come out there.
*  He was listen, look at his debate history.
*  Paul Ryan, who was no no dummy.
*  He was very good against him.
*  He was very good against Sarah Palin.
*  He was good against Trump in 2020.
*  Like they're just going to nuke him.
*  That's what they thought, I think.
*  Interesting. I don't think so.
*  You think Jill set him up to fail?
*  No, no, I think she's probably delusional like that guy with that face.
*  She's delusional. She is. Yes.
*  But I think the people behind the scenes knew exactly what was going to happen.
*  I don't think that was I think if they had a debate again,
*  it's not 100 percent that it would be that bad again.
*  That's interesting.
*  Because, again, look at the State of the Union.
*  Like sometimes he's bad, but not that bad.
*  But I think right.
*  But the State of the Union was not live.
*  And yes, it was.
*  No, no. Do you see that they found out that it wasn't that they looked at his watch
*  and his watch? No. Yeah.
*  Do State of the Union analysis, Biden's watch? No way.
*  Yeah. Someone zoomed in on his watch and his watch was the wrong time.
*  How could that even be?
*  Well, it could be he's blind.
*  You can't see what time all the networks on it.
*  I don't know what they knew.
*  How do you know what they knew?
*  You just you get a feed.
*  You know, I don't think all the Republicans would agree to it, too.
*  Because they're all there. They knew.
*  They're all there live.
*  Yeah. Doing it. Yeah.
*  You got Mike Johnson behind you.
*  You got the only audience crossing their hands
*  when they don't like what you say. It's got to be live.
*  Let's see. I don't see anything.
*  State of the Union wasn't live. I added watch.
*  It could be some troll shit.
*  They got me. Yeah. They could have got me.
*  Well, there was no Biden's watch.
*  Look at Biden's watch.
*  Incorrect time. State of the Union.
*  He has a watch as a sundial.
*  The guy's like, the guy's five thousand years old.
*  He's looking at the stars.
*  A little sextant. That's why he has that face.
*  No, President Biden's overall stress wasn't pre-recorded.
*  A fake image of the wrong time.
*  Yeah, there is a fake image.
*  They got me. These sons of bitches.
*  It's just amazing how much stuff is fake.
*  Floating around. Say it again.
*  Put it up.
*  Yeah, it's not the State of the Union.
*  Wasn't?
*  No, that was just him talking after.
*  Whatever. When after he hadn't been seen for a few days.
*  Well, that, I believe, was pre-recorded.
*  That that wouldn't make a deal.
*  What big deal one or another?
*  Like if you're giving a talk and you have something to say,
*  you also use the wrong image from a different.
*  Yeah. These cocksuckers.
*  It's just like that stuff.
*  Like who's doing that stuff and why are they doing that stuff?
*  Why are they having people talk about that and share inaccurate information?
*  It's I think it's to put everything into chaos.
*  So, you know, you have no idea what's true or what's not true.
*  And then ultimately, you you don't know what to trust or what not to trust,
*  which is a great way to get things through,
*  because then preposterous things can happen.
*  You're like, what fucking happened?
*  And then you could honestly say there's a lot of misinformation.
*  So we got to crack down on it.
*  Right. And they could probably be putting up some of that misinformation themselves.
*  What they would do, some stuff that's easily provable.
*  What they would do in eastern Germany, the Stasi,
*  they would infiltrate like some group, right, with the Stasi agent.
*  And that Stasi agent would be like, we should have with other government
*  and everyone else would be like, you're crazy.
*  We don't want that.
*  And they had arrested for colluding with someone who wants to go to the government.
*  Oh, my God. He's part of your group.
*  Yeah. Well, like the Gretchen Wittmar.
*  That one's nuts.
*  Twelve people were FBI agents.
*  Out of the 14 that were going to kidnap her.
*  But they still act as if it really happened.
*  Oh, it's so nuts, man.
*  It's so nuts.
*  It even says there's pictures of his watch with the correct time on it
*  that were taken inside the Oval Office.
*  Yeah, these cocksuckers, they got me.
*  But I also don't think why would that be a big deal if it was pre-recorded?
*  Do you know what I mean?
*  If he's just giving a talk.
*  The idea is that if he's pretending to be live, but really can't be trusted
*  because he's so gone that they edited it this way.
*  I don't believe for a second he had a cold.
*  So you think they just pulled a coup, essentially?
*  I don't think the coup is because of Covid or cold.
*  It was a win.
*  It would. Why would I?
*  OK, one thing that I think everyone, most people would understand
*  is these politicians are power hungry people, right?
*  Why would I as president step down when I do have still a decent shot
*  of being Trump again and I beat him last time, got him out of the Oval Office?
*  Especially with Mises has the ring. Right.
*  Mises doesn't want to let the ring go. Right.
*  So yet, of course, it was a coup.
*  Mises can do the debates.
*  Right. Am I wrong, though?
*  Mises is so good at debating.
*  Mises was number one in his class.
*  Number one. Right.
*  Mises has a higher IQ than you.
*  Don't you think they had to go to threats?
*  Yeah, I wonder.
*  What else would get him out of there?
*  I mean, maybe they just talked sensibly to him.
*  So I'd look, do you remember when I kill the whole party
*  because you don't want to step down?
*  Do you remember when Chuck Schumer told Dianne Feinstein
*  she's got to resign and she agreed and then forgot
*  that they had the conversation yet to talk to her three times?
*  Well, at the end, like she was having people behind her tell her what.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
*  That was not they were wheeling her around.
*  Yeah. It's like you ever see that video of the lady in Brazil
*  who brings a dead guy to the bank?
*  No. She's like holding his hand.
*  So I tried to get him to sign the money over to her.
*  You never seen that? No. Holy shit. It's amazing.
*  This lady brought a dead guy to the bank.
*  No. Oh, my. Is that a person or a dummy? He's dead.
*  He's a dead guy.
*  He's fully dead.
*  Try to get to a secure loan.
*  She's like, no, no, no, it's fine.
*  It's all good here. But put that in your hand.
*  Sign this right here.
*  And they're like, oh, my God, look at this bitch.
*  I mean, the guy's fully dead.
*  Bank employees eventually calls the police who have asked the woman.
*  She could say, well, he died on the way over.
*  I know he's dead. I was just sleepy. Jesus.
*  Just want to get some money.
*  That's our president. You have some respect.
*  That's not our president. Yes, it was.
*  That's a dead guy. That was literally our president.
*  Do you think Biden's alive?
*  And if you think he wasn't alive, do you think they'd tell us
*  if they have this body double out there running around for national security
*  reasons, don't you think they would just keep their mouth shut?
*  No, because I think it would behoove them if she got to be president.
*  Because then she's a stronger nominee.
*  So if he was dead, then they would it would be good
*  because she would be the president then.
*  And then who then then they would. Yeah. Hmm.
*  But now there were rumors going around that during this window of time
*  where he vanished from the face of the earth, which is not a thing
*  that happens with presidents where you don't know where they are,
*  where he was having a seizure, he was like this internet stuff.
*  Got abducted by aliens and they grew him.
*  That's how he's better.
*  Or beelzebub. The aliens came along.
*  They used the new tech.
*  He opened the gateway.
*  He gained six inches, Spry pep in his step.
*  I here's the question I have.
*  I don't know if he's going to be there in January through January. Right.
*  Right. Yeah, he's got to make it.
*  And I'm very worried about Taiwan.
*  Yeah, because if I'm China or if I'm Putin,
*  now's the time to move. Right.
*  We got a vacuum of leadership in the White House.
*  Oh, that's a scary one.
*  You think he's going to serve out the term?
*  I don't know.
*  When I see that guy that supposedly is Biden,
*  I'm like, I don't know what's going on now.
*  I since we live in a simulation
*  and I'm going to spoil the best comedy of all time, VEEP,
*  at a certain point, VEEP becomes president and then she's voted out
*  like five months later.
*  And since Officer Harris is basically Selena Meyer, just like dipped in chocolate.
*  I don't think he's going to be president through January. Wow.
*  So who becomes vice president?
*  She's going to wish he's going to pick one of these governors, right?
*  She's going to pick.
*  It's either what Roy Cooper of North Carolina,
*  Andy Beshear of Kentucky or Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania.
*  Is the shortlist is what I heard.
*  You know what they do?
*  They do what like a kind of an insecure comic does.
*  That's the one I was talking about.
*  Yeah, this one.
*  Look at him. Walks.
*  Look how tall he is.
*  Look, he's towering over her.
*  But also how thick quickly he's walking.
*  Yeah, he's got he doesn't understand.
*  He thinks he's walking like an old man because that's a 40 year old dude.
*  Very strange.
*  He definitely is walking way better. Yeah.
*  Do you can you put a footages and there's also a kind of a power to his step,
*  like he's trying to walk slowly.
*  Yeah. Well, there's there's an effortlessness to the way he's walking.
*  This is again, armchair physiologist Joe Rogan.
*  When I'm looking at.
*  Oh, it looks side by side. Wow.
*  This is from April or something.
*  OK, which is the fake one?
*  The tall one on the left.
*  Choreography, acknowledging the body's awkward on camera walks
*  to the south on his halting, stiff gait.
*  Well, that looks the same as the other one.
*  The one on the left does. Yeah, that looks like this again.
*  Now that looks a little more effortless, dude.
*  Look, he's look, he's much more casual.
*  I mean, he's walking with a little bit of stiffness to his arms,
*  but it's much more casual with his legs. Let me see it again.
*  I don't know. I might be fucking with my own mind.
*  He's definitely taller, though.
*  He looks tall. Yeah, that's the thing.
*  The big one is this one. That's the big one. Yeah. Yeah.
*  That one's nuts.
*  That one freaks me out because look, he's walking fine.
*  He's walking fine. And he's so big.
*  Look how big he is.
*  Like clearly bigger.
*  Would you ever want to get a body double Joe Rogan body double?
*  I have four of them right now. Yeah. Yeah.
*  They're doing sets all over the country and open mic nights.
*  Oh, shit. I just saw Joe Rogan. Can you imagine?
*  Yeah. Well, the thing is about like you can find
*  a tall, thin person.
*  Well, you can probably find some short jack guys that can pretend to be.
*  Yeah, you just have to.
*  And there's enough this plant, like especially if you're just watching video.
*  Yeah. So that's a different one.
*  Yes. OK. Yeah. That one's very slow.
*  But also that could be the end of the day.
*  But also look at his posture, though, the heads at an angle instead of straight up.
*  Right. That's the difference for me.
*  Well, it's also he looks like he's struggling there to walk.
*  Whereas the other one of the new guy, the recent one,
*  he doesn't look like he's struggling at all.
*  So this is the look how he's going up the stairs.
*  Effortless man. Weird.
*  He's going up the stairs like a regular person.
*  Yeah. Not fallen.
*  Well, he's not struggling.
*  There's like a hitch to the gate.
*  Like what you saw at the debate when he had to step down off the platform.
*  We had to do it sideways.
*  Can we like remember when she was asked about the debate by Stephen Colbert?
*  So look at this one right now.
*  So this is him walking in that other one.
*  He's really struggling there.
*  But again, that could be just like his mental ability.
*  Yeah. It could come and go, especially with that fucking juicy alien cocktail.
*  They jazzed or it could be jet lag.
*  Imagine if he really did grow six inches.
*  It really is Biden.
*  They really do have some stuff.
*  It rejuvenates you, but you also grow.
*  I get all that shit in two minutes.
*  It'll be a real problem.
*  Why? We're going to look like the onunaki
*  like that dude with the fucking rubber in his face.
*  We're all going to be 10 feet tall.
*  It's like maybe that's what the onunaki are.
*  Because the whole thing is that they're supposed to be way taller than us.
*  I was talking to Kurt Metzger about this.
*  Oh, boy.
*  And I love Kurt. He's just the best.
*  I know. I just will go off, though.
*  He'll go off in his eyes get crazy and he gets in your face.
*  He's sucking on a vape pad.
*  And then it's so great.
*  And I'm just give me, give me, give me.
*  Oh, he's the best.
*  He had this whole thing about the typography of the different aliens.
*  And like these ones hate these ones.
*  These ones look white.
*  These ones look like Aryans.
*  And Kurt believes everything.
*  He the Jimmy Dorshow wrecked him being on that show.
*  He was normal before he started going over there.
*  Yeah. Well, he was always crazy.
*  But he was like a different kind of crazy.
*  Yeah. But I don't think Kurt's crazy because everything he says,
*  I look up and there's receipts.
*  It's based on something.
*  I don't mean crazy, like incorrect.
*  Right. OK. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  It's maniac. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Like I'll show you the walls of text that he sends me.
*  I'm sure he sends them to you.
*  Yes, of course. Walls.
*  He lives here now.
*  Walls. Yeah, yeah.
*  Well, I trucked him into moving here.
*  Yeah, good. But he's the best.
*  And he's such a funny dude, too.
*  And his his his ability to like have jokes.
*  He's like a joke machine.
*  For any situation that comes up,
*  there are two things Kurt told me that I think about like once a week
*  because they're so funny.
*  And I'm just like, I'm in the presence of like a comedy legend.
*  One is he was talking to Patrice O'Neill and Kurt had just seen Fight Club.
*  And Patrice is like, oh, that's the ultimate white people movie.
*  And Kurt's like, what do you mean?
*  Goes, oh, I don't have enough violence in my life.
*  I got to go seek it out.
*  And I want someone to punch me in the face.
*  I know what that's like.
*  He's like, yeah.
*  So that was one.
*  And then Kurt did his homework on Paula Dean,
*  who got canceled because she used the N word once.
*  And he looked it up.
*  And it turned out that she said it when she was getting robbed
*  at gunpoint as a bank clerk.
*  And he goes, this is the most progressive old fat southern white lady ever.
*  He goes, they should build a statue to her.
*  That's really when she said yes.
*  And dads will bring their sons.
*  And the plaque will say she only said it once.
*  Look, son, this is a progressive.
*  I didn't know that's what happened.
*  Yes. Per Kurt, please double check this.
*  Yeah, you never know.
*  He also told me that that plane that disappeared got sucked into a vortex.
*  No, he did. Oh, yeah.
*  Send me videos. The Malaysian.
*  Yeah, that one.
*  Well, remember, Don Lemon asked if it was a black hole
*  on CNN, the dumbest man on formerly dumbest man in television.
*  What if it was a black hole?
*  Isn't it interesting watching guys like him without the whole production crew?
*  And Chris Cuomo. Yeah.
*  Fredo. Well, what Dave Smith did to him.
*  Holy shit.
*  That was like Mike Tyson versus Marvis Frazier in the 80s.
*  It was a beautiful, beautiful thing.
*  And it couldn't happen to a better guy.
*  And it's even funnier is, you know how Greeks like tantalus,
*  like in the afterlife, he's always reaching for water or food.
*  And it's always out of his reach because he served his son to the gods, his food.
*  Like when you're on CNN, like Rogan and these podcasts,
*  even the audience is a hundred times bigger.
*  It's like beneath you because they're like nothing.
*  And I'm the real guy.
*  And now he's got to be a sidekick on Patrick by David.
*  No disrespect to Patrick at all.
*  And he knows that every single person at CNN, the camera guys,
*  the door guy is laughing at what a nothing in their eyes he's become.
*  It's kind of genius by Patrick to put him on a show.
*  Oh, it is. Personal hell.
*  It's kind of genius because you really can't escape
*  not just what you've said, but the tendencies you've developed
*  and being on those broadcast networks.
*  And the sneering. Yeah.
*  So kudos to Patrick.
*  It's kind of crazy. It's hilarious. Yeah.
*  Well, Elon did it, too, with with Lemon with one show.
*  Well, Lemon wanted ownership.
*  Well, it's not just that.
*  The way they had the conversation, he was trying to do CNN outside.
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's how Elon said it.
*  Yeah. In CNN, outside of CNN.
*  It was. And now bitch can't get arrested.
*  Yeah. But that's like the quality of his discourse.
*  Right. That's where he deserves to be.
*  It's not good conversation. It's not interesting.
*  You know what I always say?
*  I say the enemy class is not composed of impressive people.
*  And now the biggest alpha male on CNN is Caitlin Collins.
*  Yeah, they're all gone. Well, Jake Tapper still there.
*  Yes, true. He did it.
*  Jake Tapper is an honest guy, I think.
*  I I and who was the other woman?
*  Martha was it? Who was the female moderator?
*  I don't know. Dana Bash was that her name?
*  I and everyone else must give them credit
*  for doing such an honest and fair job of the debate.
*  They let them both speak.
*  They didn't talk over them.
*  The questions were reasonable and tough questions for both parties.
*  I didn't think he had it in him.
*  So kudos to Jake Tapper.
*  And I'm going to apologize for saying that he always looks like someone just farted.
*  Because he did a great job.
*  And he also did a great job with Chris Coons, who's head of Biden's campaign.
*  He was holding his feet to the fire about the debate.
*  So I didn't know where where this came from.
*  But I was wrong about Jake Tapper.
*  Yeah, it's I think there's a lot of people that are in media
*  that didn't want to do the thing that they're doing now.
*  They didn't want to do it that way.
*  But now they're in this machine.
*  And this is what they want to do because they want to keep their career.
*  Well, this is their only way to have status.
*  These are mediocre people.
*  Yeah, they don't.
*  They're not going to if you're not writing for the New York Times.
*  No one's reading your substack.
*  You're nobody. I know nothing. You're not interesting.
*  They're not impressive or interesting people. Right.
*  Look at this guy. No opinion.
*  Like he's if you look at his photo, he looks like Jared from Subway.
*  Who? Exactly.
*  Who are you talking about? No opinion.
*  Who's that? He's one of these nobody.
*  Oh, is it no opinion? Yes. Not Noah.
*  No, it's not. I thought you're saying Noah.
*  I am. Noahpinion.
*  So it's like Mike Cunt.
*  You know, like Mike Cunt.
*  It's just like that. Yeah.
*  Except he would not like that.
*  Has anybody seen Mike Cunt?
*  And no one's seen no opinion.
*  Interesting. Well, there's a lot of those guys.
*  A lot of them. Yeah.
*  And then you think they're just getting paid just like
*  this conservative guy that I know.
*  I don't think that's not that they're getting paid.
*  It's that like they do not.
*  They're violently anti charismatic.
*  No one wants them at the party.
*  So all they can do is go on these other.
*  And I say to someone who does this a lot myself, go on like social media
*  and try to kind of make Aaron Rupar make a name for yourself by
*  just spouting complete nonsense.
*  Who's the best at it?
*  Best in what way? Keith Oberyn.
*  Oh.
*  My favorite angry lesbian.
*  She she literally has brain damage.
*  He's a gift. Really?
*  Oh, yeah. What happened?
*  Traumatic brain injury. From what?
*  Like got hit by like a cinder block or something.
*  Well, look this up, Jamie. It's it's on his Wikipedia.
*  Oh, that makes sense.
*  Yeah. So he's he's he said, do you see that?
*  He said the CNN building should be burned down.
*  Oh, he said kick everyone out, burn down the building.
*  For what? Because of the debate.
*  Wow. Yeah.
*  This is not someone who's well.
*  So when did he get hit in the head?
*  I think the 80s. Whoa.
*  It's been a minute. Yeah. Oh, man.
*  And what's even funnier is his Twitter.
*  He used to have a million Twitter followers and it's slowly been going down
*  because at a certain point, even the boomers like, OK, dude, calm down.
*  Like Trump isn't literally going to kill you tomorrow.
*  He's amazing. Yeah, he's so great.
*  He's a gift. Remember when you used to do that show from his basement?
*  Oh, yeah. Like the resistance.
*  You know, and any day now, Donald Trump will be locked up.
*  So I'm just going to shut the show down.
*  Well, he was right. He did get locked up.
*  They eventually they arrested him. Yeah, eventually.
*  That's a crazy one, huh?
*  The 34 counts of felony counts that were all misdemeanors.
*  And did you see Andrew Cuomo?
*  Yeah. Came out. It's like this is bullshit.
*  Yeah. And talked about it on Bill Maher. Yeah. Yeah.
*  That I was surprised that Cuomo was a guy they shouldn't have got rid of
*  because that guy could have won.
*  He could have been the president.
*  What about killing all the old people?
*  Yeah, that was a little bit of a problem.
*  We didn't know. We didn't know.
*  When you're president, you're supposed to kill young people, not old people.
*  Right. Not supposed to take COVID patients, throw them back in the nursing homes
*  and then put a bunch of people on ventilators. Whoops. Yeah. Whoopsies.
*  But they didn't know.
*  They thought ventilators were the way to go.
*  But they knew. Sure.
*  But the point is, if you got something this bad wrong and tried to cover it up,
*  it's going to be hard to get through that White House.
*  Yeah, that's a bit of an issue. Yeah.
*  The the nursing home.
*  And also as as a New York Jew, that New York Italian attitude,
*  I know that works in in Middle America.
*  If you're trying to be president, you're going to have to do something to deal with.
*  Well, Chelsea Handler said she was Cuomo sexual, so that settles that.
*  Chelsea Handler was that but that dude's final form was.
*  Everybody loved Cuomo when he was run in New York at the beginning of the pandemic,
*  because he seemed so reasonable and measured and leader like.
*  Well, he got in his one thing I did like about him is that he would have those daily updates.
*  So he was trying to do what he could to be as visible and, you know,
*  you have as much information as possible.
*  The better than the guy, the lady they have now,
*  who says black people don't know what computers are.
*  Kathy Hokel.
*  Jesus Christ, get this bitch a broom and send her back where she came from.
*  Holy crap.
*  Jesus, they're wild.
*  They don't know what computers are.
*  New York is a New York is a rap.
*  This is why I'm here.
*  I still am. I'm fine. Oh.
*  I want credit from your boy, Elon.
*  What did you do?
*  I am the first person on Earth, I believe, learning how to drive on a Cybertruck.
*  Really? Yes.
*  You didn't know how to drive at all. I still don't really.
*  Oh, my God. My buddy, Colin Robbs, a professional
*  car tester, whatever NASCAR.
*  My buddy, Sky King, they rented a Cybertruck.
*  They're like, all right, let's let's do it.
*  It's like my fourth lesson.
*  I only clipped one window.
*  But I was doing what would you hit?
*  I didn't. I wasn't told, Colin,
*  that when you're going down these narrow streets, you're supposed to hug the median
*  instead of imagining if there's two lanes.
*  So some parked car had a window at a mirror.
*  Excuse me. I clicked it.
*  But it was fine.
*  And the window popped off the Cybertruck, the mirror, and we popped it back on.
*  Oh, so just bent backwards.
*  Not even like a little just right.
*  Yeah. Well, they they give in.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  That's what the way they're designed.
*  Yeah. That's a crazy car to learn how to drive on.
*  Yeah. It was wide.
*  Yeah, big and also like heavy as fuck.
*  But I felt safe that if I got an accident, somebody else would have the consequences.
*  That's true.
*  Which was that's the fear that people have about people driving those things.
*  You're essentially driving a giant steel box.
*  It's bulletproof.
*  And you know, that puts on a like a show.
*  Oh, yeah. I'll dance for you.
*  Right. There's a laser show and there's also a megaphone.
*  Really? Yeah.
*  And also he's a Simpsons fan,
*  because when Homer Simpson designed a car for his brother
*  and ruined his brother's company,
*  Homer said there should be horns everywhere and they should all play like a car.
*  And you can make the horn one of like 15 choices like a car.
*  Oh, my God. And I know that's a Simpsons joke.
*  That's hilarious.
*  He's done a lot of wild things with that car, with all of his cars.
*  It's like, you know, if you say you press the speak thing,
*  say open butthole, the port opens up to charge us.
*  Yes, it does. I'll show you. Mine's out here.
*  Oh, my God. It's hilarious.
*  You say open butthole and the port pops open.
*  He's like 14.
*  There's very few humans like him that are going to be able to run
*  a social media site like that and also just be able to handle being attacked
*  relentlessly and like complete Teflon open buttholes.
*  See?
*  Does someone say open butthole? Yeah.
*  Say it. Wow.
*  Hilarious.
*  I still never I've been around him a couple of times.
*  I've never hung out with him, so I'm looking forward to it.
*  He's a good dude. Yeah.
*  He's a fascinating character.
*  He's handling this very bizarre position in life.
*  That's about as good as you can.
*  I mean, no one's going to handle that very well.
*  I think he did it.
*  He really stuck his neck out with with Twitter.
*  I'm dead naming it.
*  Four billion dollars is a big stick your neck out.
*  Because what's it worth now?
*  I don't think the money to stick your neck out.
*  It's like he's a target now.
*  And the people who used to love him for the electric cars now think he's a fascist.
*  Isn't that interesting?
*  Like the people that loved him in California.
*  If you drove a Tesla, it was a sign that you were environmentally conscious.
*  You read The New Yorker.
*  Yeah, you're a good person. Yeah.
*  Yeah, you're driving a Tesla.
*  I still think I don't think there's a stigma to it yet.
*  Not yet. They haven't completely.
*  They're too good.
*  They haven't. Yeah.
*  Then they haven't completely marginalized him or tried to or stigmatized him rather,
*  I should say. It just doesn't work.
*  Just kind of drifts off of them because there's so much support for him.
*  You know, is just most people recognize that you really,
*  especially when the Twitter files came out, when Taibbi and Schellenberger
*  released all those Twitter files and you you realize like there was like
*  a real concerted effort to hide the truth from people.
*  And then people being gaslit to be like, we knew all this the whole time.
*  No, no, we didn't.
*  So all this stuff about COVID with Jay Bhattacharya and all those other people
*  that got unfairly maligned, you know, real actual experts.
*  And the government was telling them to suppress them,
*  which also tells me that they wouldn't be able to do it a second time.
*  You think so?
*  Because I think he's autistic enough that he dig in his heels. Right.
*  And that's not a knock against him. That's a compliment.
*  I wonder if someone's going to try to take him out.
*  He's got great security and body doubles.
*  Does he have body doubles?
*  Well, let's get that Chinese guy.
*  He's got to be like a robot.
*  He's got to have like like like a Lex, a hundred clones of himself.
*  Have you seen the Chinese Elon?
*  No. There's a guy who looks almost exactly like him, who lives in China.
*  So slightly off, like if it was like you spliced him.
*  Wait, you're saying there's a Chinese person who looks like somebody else?
*  It looks almost exactly like Elon.
*  Not like a regular Chinese guy.
*  Let's can you pull her off?
*  Yeah, I can't tell if this is real or not.
*  I think it's real because I just want to make sure I didn't pull the wrong video.
*  Right. Yeah, because he can fuck with you now.
*  He's just going to pull up Jackie Chan.
*  Bruce Lee.
*  Let's see Elon Musk.
*  I think this is him.
*  It doesn't look like a deep fake.
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. OK, I could see it.
*  I mean, I think.
*  Yeah, I think that's the one.
*  Yeah, for sure. It looks like a deep fake, too.
*  It does look a little deep. That's not how Elon talks.
*  God, that's pretty close.
*  But the motions aren't correct.
*  Yeah, but the thing he's doing with his lips.
*  The eyes are moving right.
*  That looks fake.
*  Yeah. And the clothes are way off.
*  That didn't right at the end. It looked OK.
*  One million followers. Holy crap.
*  Hmm. There's a lot of videos of this guy up there.
*  It's hard to say, man, because there's something about his face to me.
*  I got that uncanny valley thing going on with this.
*  Like it might. This looks like bullshit.
*  Oh, by the way, he's got good dimples moving here.
*  The side, the muscles in the face are moving pretty good.
*  You can't. That's pretty hard.
*  The eyes are really creepy.
*  Those are Elon's eyes.
*  Just the weird eyes. It's so close.
*  But he doesn't look Asian.
*  That's what's weird. That's Elon's face.
*  That really does look like that.
*  It really does look like that looks like that's got to be a.
*  There's no way that's not a. That's Elon's face.
*  Google is the Asian Elon Musk fake.
*  That's that's Elon's. That was Elon's face.
*  The one that I saw that I remember seeing was from about two years ago.
*  And it was much less obvious.
*  It was like close. Like, oh, look at that guy.
*  Looks just like him.
*  It's suspended from.
*  Oh, oh, it's been suspended. Wow.
*  Why is he suspended?
*  Chinese doppelganger suspended from China's TikTok, huh?
*  Interesting. So it's real.
*  Huh? He's been dubbed by Internet.
*  Wait, I'm sorry. Why are we not calling him the Chinese knockoff?
*  That's that's the line.
*  He's the Chinese knockoff, Elon.
*  Much cheaper, shittier quality.
*  He's been deleted on Weibo.
*  All but three posts are left.
*  Elon Musk.
*  The account largely inactive as well.
*  Local reports have noticed that Elon's doppelganger was banned
*  for violating community guidelines.
*  See, I wonder if they're running him through a filter, though.
*  There's got to be. Come on.
*  That was crazy.
*  Really good software engineer.
*  And he just said, fuck it. I'll show you.
*  Yeah, I mean, it seems like he's probably close enough
*  and then did some right shenanigans.
*  It's going to be so hard to tell.
*  Face swap isn't that hard to do.
*  Not hard at all.
*  And AI generated videos and images.
*  It's going to be so hard.
*  There's been ones of you. Oh, yeah.
*  Oh, did you see Elon just played?
*  Did you see the one of Kamala Harris? Yeah.
*  Oh, my God. That's hilarious.
*  And do you see what Gavin Newsom said to him? No.
*  Gavin Newsom said that you should be posting this.
*  That we're going to make it illegal and I'm going to sign a law.
*  And he said, Professor, suck on these nuts.
*  No, he didn't. Yes, he did.
*  Elon said that to Gavin Newsom.
*  Yes, he did. Yeah.
*  Pull that post up, Jamie.
*  It's so hilarious.
*  He said, Professor,
*  Suck on these nuts, says it's legit and that parody is legal.
*  I forget what his exact quote was.
*  I'm paraphrasing.
*  But parody is allowed by law, which it should be.
*  Yeah, no shit. Yeah.
*  But the fact that they're using AI to generate her saying a bunch of stuff.
*  But was it wasn't that actually her voice, though?
*  Yeah, I thought they clipped. It wasn't AI.
*  Oh, it wasn't AI? I thought it was like sound bites that they stitched together.
*  Perhaps. Because it's not it's choppy.
*  Right. But yeah, I don't know how they did it.
*  But they most certainly could do it with AI, though,
*  that would also make it seem choppy because it doesn't really run
*  in the cadence of a normal human speech.
*  But it seemed like the words were like, you know, I they just added like not
*  the words were not anything fancy.
*  Well, remember when they did that with Reagan? No.
*  Yeah, they did that with Reagan.
*  That was the first one they ever did.
*  Way, way, way back in the day, they I think it was Iran.
*  I forget which country did it, but they made some fake audio recording of Reagan.
*  And then upon analysis.
*  And again, this is in the 80s, right?
*  So the technology was very crude at the time.
*  They just audio stitched it together and edited it.
*  They found bits and pieces from each one of his speeches
*  that they had compiled this this one thing to.
*  But that was the first time that ever happened.
*  Elon retweets altered Kamala Harris campaign.
*  She says, manipulate good.
*  It says back up says manipulating voices in an ad like this should be illegal.
*  I'll be signing a bill in a matter of weeks to make sure it is.
*  And then he says, I checked with renowned world authority
*  professors, Sagan, Deez nuts.
*  And he said parity is legal in America.
*  Oh, my God. Hilarious.
*  We don't deserve him. Hilarious.
*  What a wild dude. Wow.
*  What a wild dude, because he's not scared of those folks
*  because he's the richest man in the world.
*  Would you be scared? It's not like it's not.
*  Would you be scared of Gavin Newsom?
*  No. But it's also like what Gavin Newsom represents.
*  Right. He's a part of this machine. Right.
*  You know, you attack him like that.
*  They're going to attack you.
*  Even if you don't find that Reagan, even if you don't attack him like that,
*  they're going to attack you.
*  The Reagan audio compilation.
*  I forget what it was in reference to, but it was something.
*  Some mean Reagan was saying something outrageous that he would never say.
*  And they have that for like Iran.
*  They have a bunch of people saying whatever you want them to say.
*  But this was back in the day.
*  And then they put it on television, on the news,
*  showing all the different pieces of different speeches of him
*  wearing different suits of all the things that he had actually said
*  and how they pieced it together.
*  This is like very early on indication that you got to be careful with technology.
*  This was very rudimentary technology, relatively speaking.
*  Do you have a pee?
*  What did he say? I'm trying to find it.
*  A couple more minutes.
*  They took a bunch of Ronald Reagan speeches and they spliced them together
*  to make an.
*  An inaccurate, a fake.
*  Make him say something he never really said.
*  But I remember it was on the news. It was like a big deal.
*  I don't remember this at all.
*  Yeah, like a Reagan, I don't remember it.
*  Maybe it's one of those Mandela effect.
*  Yeah, I I'm having something with that right now. With what?
*  My friend Michael Wolf, he's a strength coach here in Austin.
*  He's got a great dog named Chops.
*  And I remember very distinctly that Chops looks like he's mostly Great Dane.
*  He's got the coat color is big.
*  And I remember distinctly Michael telling me, oh, we did the DNA test.
*  He's actually not great.
*  Dan at all. He's something something else and has some Rhodesian ridgeback.
*  And I'm hanging out with him and shops and I go to him.
*  I go, it's just so funny that there's no great Dane in him.
*  He's so and he goes, what are you talking about?
*  And I go, you the test goes never did this.
*  And I don't know any other dog where this could be.
*  So I'm paying for him to do the DNA test to see if this is a Mandela effect thing,
*  because I remember very specific to that conversation.
*  That's bizarre. Yep.
*  You think the simulation is real? Yes.
*  I know it's real because it keeps winking.
*  You've had a wink to you all the time. I'm sure.
*  I was I was with you at the Green Room and I go, Joe, like
*  like all these things are happening.
*  Like, does it ever get normal?
*  Goes, no, you go, no, no, no.
*  You're just going to have to go with it like this.
*  Like I talked to Jordan Peterson about this.
*  He goes, at a certain point you wake up and you're like, oh, the president's yelling me today.
*  And he's like, you just have to accept this is what your reality is.
*  Yeah. When it happens to me, I just hear that Queens of the Stone Age song.
*  Go with the flow. Yeah.
*  It's like, all right, this is this.
*  So, yeah, Roseanne's texting me now.
*  OK, I guess this is my life.
*  This is what we're dealing with. Yes.
*  Of course, we're in a simulation.
*  You don't think that this is a 3D projection of a 40 world.
*  Mm hmm. Who's running it?
*  I don't. The machine elves. Right.
*  That's more likely. Yes.
*  Yeah. Tricksters. Yes.
*  That's why it's so silly.
*  That's why it's so fun for me. Right.
*  And for you and any comedian. Right.
*  A real comedian.
*  Yeah. If you really embrace the chaos.
*  Yeah. Not if you're trusting him.
*  Double mask and right.
*  Tell people how to vote. Yes.
*  And put on a song and dance for Pfizer.
*  Yes. God.
*  Good Lord. Good Lord.
*  Stephen Colbert priest must be.
*  But he wasn't really a comedian.
*  Colbert was never a stand up.
*  Yeah, but Strangers with Candy was one of the greatest shows of all time.
*  It was one of the most transgressive shows of all time.
*  And now I don't know what Strangers with Candy is.
*  Oh, my God. I never watched it.
*  I only knew him from the Colbert report and from being on The Daily Show.
*  Strangers with Candy is one of the greatest shows of all time.
*  Really? I'll tell you what it's about.
*  It's about starring Amy Sedaris, David's sister.
*  It's about a woman named Jerry Blank who returns to high school,
*  picking up her life where she left it off as a teenage runaway.
*  And she became a user, a boozer and a loser.
*  So she's this 47 year old ex junkie prostitute.
*  Oh, that lady is hilarious. Yeah.
*  And Colbert was her teacher.
*  99. Wow.
*  Well, Colbert was amazing as that character.
*  Yes. And then when you see him on his actual show, you're like, hey.
*  Is that really you?
*  Who are you? He knows better.
*  That's why he's not off the hook in my book.
*  Mr. Noblet was the teacher. Yeah.
*  Jerry, I know that, you know, we have our tough times
*  and you think that I hate you, but I want you to know that I hate you.
*  She's like, I hate you, too, Mr. Noblet.
*  We probably shouldn't hug. No, no, not.
*  I want to check that show.
*  Oh, it's seasons. Did it go?
*  When Winona Ryder was in the last episode?
*  No, Ken. They got Winona Ryder on TV.
*  I'm so weird that I never heard of the pilot episode.
*  Maybe I didn't have forgot the pilot episode.
*  They try to get Jerry to spy in her locker
*  mate because they suspect her locker mate might be retarded.
*  And they're like, well, why do you want me to, you know, turn her in?
*  And he's like, well, you've got those braces and they tend to be attracted
*  to, you know, shiny objects. Oh, my God.
*  So that was the pilot episode. Wow.
*  I had three seasons, but it was only on TV for like a year and a half.
*  No, no, it was three years. It wasn't a year.
*  That's what this says. I'm looking at the Wikipedia.
*  It says like season three started in July 2000 and ended October 2000.
*  When did season one start? April 99, ended July 99.
*  Wow. They were that quick.
*  So they were like, yeah, those six month seasons.
*  It was there was one episode. I have a site.
*  What was it on? Comedy Central.
*  Oh, OK. That makes sense.
*  In my living room framed because I wrote to her.
*  She's hooking up with the football player and she's like,
*  don't worry about getting me pregnant. My ovaries are diseased.
*  So I have my ovaries. To Michael, my ovaries are diseased.
*  Jerry Blank signed by Amy. That's awesome.
*  It's a great. So he was on this show and like him and the other teacher
*  give each other blow jobs in the bathroom, like that kind of humor.
*  And now look at him. Yeah.
*  Remember when he was dancing with Chuck Schumer and he high fives him?
*  Ever see that? No.
*  Oh, yeah. They're all wearing masks and dancing around outside.
*  And he's dancing Chuck Schumer and he dances over and high fives Chuck Schumer.
*  I hope it's worth it for him. However much money they give him.
*  There he is. Watch this. See they're all dancing like.
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. Look at him.
*  All these people are masks on outside. That lady's double masking.
*  He's not wearing a mask. Of course. He's a rebel.
*  He's from Strangers with Candy. He's a wild man. Look at him.
*  Well, he probably recently got vaccinated or something ridiculous.
*  The mask days. Even when I look at videos and I see people wearing masks,
*  I can't believe that's real. I can't believe that was just a couple of years ago.
*  What about you? You still see them in the airports?
*  Yeah. Goofy people.
*  Well, I was assumed now that they have like some disease.
*  It's a good thing to assume. I used to assume they're from another country.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  People from other countries would wear masks all the time.
*  There were a lot of mass being polite. They're just being polite.
*  They don't spit on you. Yeah.
*  These people over here are just nuts. You got to go to Japan, dude.
*  I will go. Michael Malice, you're the fucking man. I appreciate you very much.
*  It's always fun hanging out with you. Thank you so much, sir.
*  My pleasure, brother. Let's hang out. Yep.
*  Okay. Bye.
*  Bye.
