# Joe Rogan Experience #2043  - Francis Foster & Konstantin Kisin
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6.0s)]
*  When you have headphones on in a video game, like you can hear things behind you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12.0s)]
*  You can hear things in front of you. You get a sense of where they are. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=17.0s)]
*  That's one of the... God damn those things are addictive. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=21.0s)]
*  Yeah man, I'm a gamer. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=24.0s)]
*  They're so addictive. But that's why. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=26.0s)]
*  It's so immersive now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=30.0s)]
*  Are you into video games? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=33.0s)]
*  Oh my God, I have a real problem. I can't play them. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=34.0s)]
*  I literally can't play them. I can play pool. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=36.0s)]
*  Because pool, I'm addicted to that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=38.0s)]
*  But pool to me is like a mind exercise. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=40.0s)]
*  It's like a concentration exercise as much as it is a game. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=44.0s)]
*  It's all about everything has to move together in perfect synchronicity. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=47.0s)]
*  When I'm playing video games, I'm just absorbed in this adrenaline-fueled chaos of graphics and sounds and explosions. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=53.0s)]
*  It's just way too good. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=62.0s)]
*  That's the problem. You don't want to do anything else. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=64.0s)]
*  You just want to fucking go crazy and play video games. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=66.0s)]
*  There's this game I play, Escape from Tarkov, that I just... [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=68.0s)]
*  I shouldn't be allowed to play it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=72.0s)]
*  It's not good for my family, man. It's just like 10 hours a day. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=74.0s)]
*  And before you know it, the whole day is gone. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=78.0s)]
*  You don't lose sleep. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=80.0s)]
*  Wolfenstein 3D, that was the game where it just felt kind of like... [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=83.0s)]
*  The first time I saw Wolfenstein 3D, which probably shows how old I am now. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=88.0s)]
*  That's the original id Software title. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=92.0s)]
*  That's the first one they did. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=94.0s)]
*  You quit at the right time, man. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=96.0s)]
*  That's what it looked like. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=100.0s)]
*  Oh man. So many hours of my childhood were spent on that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=102.0s)]
*  So I started off with Quake 1. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=106.0s)]
*  Quake 1 on a computer. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=109.0s)]
*  I was just playing the game itself. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=111.0s)]
*  Because I used a Mac. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=113.0s)]
*  And so they put out... [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=116.0s)]
*  How was the car, gentlemen? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=118.0s)]
*  Thank you, brother. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=119.0s)]
*  We're like gentlemen here. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=120.0s)]
*  Enjoying some company. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=122.0s)]
*  But that was just... You just play the game. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=124.0s)]
*  And then I found out about online playing. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=127.0s)]
*  I was like, oh no. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=130.0s)]
*  Oh no. What a life suck that is. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=132.0s)]
*  Do you let your kids play? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=135.0s)]
*  They play games. Yeah. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=138.0s)]
*  But fortunately, one's really into roadblocks. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=140.0s)]
*  What's roadblocks? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=143.0s)]
*  Roadblocks. R-O-B-O-L or B-L-O-X. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=145.0s)]
*  I think that's what it is, right? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=149.0s)]
*  It's just like they have these little worlds they create. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=151.0s)]
*  And they run around with their friends in there. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=154.0s)]
*  It seems like fun. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=156.0s)]
*  You just have to limit the amount of time they do it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=158.0s)]
*  And you have to explain to them. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=160.0s)]
*  Don't just let them figure out it's addictive. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=162.0s)]
*  Explain to them that it's addictive. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=164.0s)]
*  Explain to them that there's things that you're going to want to get really good at that won't help you. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=166.0s)]
*  Yes. It's a great way of looking at it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=172.0s)]
*  Because I had a friend. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=175.0s)]
*  He was one of the guys who was one of the managers of the comic store. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=177.0s)]
*  Super awesome guy. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=180.0s)]
*  He was hooked on EverQuest. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=182.0s)]
*  You know that game? Remember that game? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=185.0s)]
*  Remember that game, Jamie? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=187.0s)]
*  Massive online multiplayer game. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=189.0s)]
*  You're a wizard. You cast spells and shit. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=192.0s)]
*  That kind of thing. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=194.0s)]
*  One day, I'll never forget. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=196.0s)]
*  We were all standing around in the comic store bar. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=198.0s)]
*  And he was pale. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=200.0s)]
*  Pale like paper. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=202.0s)]
*  He hadn't been out of the house in days. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=204.0s)]
*  His eyes were sunk into his head. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=206.0s)]
*  He goes, I am so good at making money in the game. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=208.0s)]
*  And so bad at doing it in real life. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=212.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=214.0s)]
*  I was like, whoa. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=216.0s)]
*  You've put all your energy into getting really good at something [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=218.0s)]
*  that doesn't do you any good. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=223.0s)]
*  Unless you're going to be a professional. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=225.0s)]
*  Which they do have. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=227.0s)]
*  That's a hard thing to say to a kid. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=229.0s)]
*  Don't play video games. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=231.0s)]
*  If then you find out how much video game players are making. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=233.0s)]
*  It's like, don't start a podcast. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=235.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=237.0s)]
*  Are we dinosaurs? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=239.0s)]
*  They're so good. I'm not talking shit about games. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=241.0s)]
*  But you've got to control it is what you're saying. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=243.0s)]
*  They're too good. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=245.0s)]
*  Your life is boring as fuck compared to those games. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=247.0s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=252.0s)]
*  There's no way it's as exciting as playing Quake 3 Arena online [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=254.0s)]
*  with a 30 inch monitor. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=258.0s)]
*  And you're sitting right in front of it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=260.0s)]
*  And you've got fucking headphones on. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=262.0s)]
*  Explosions and lightning guns. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=264.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=266.0s)]
*  Because if you think about it right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=268.0s)]
*  Computer games are instant gratification. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=270.0s)]
*  And that's how you get success in a computer game. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=272.0s)]
*  But if you think about life. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=275.0s)]
*  Life, how to become successful is basically deferred gratification. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=277.0s)]
*  And there's another level to it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=281.0s)]
*  Which is in a computer game rewards are linear. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=283.0s)]
*  You work for a bit. You get a reward. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=286.0s)]
*  You work for a bit. You get a reward. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=288.0s)]
*  But life isn't like that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=290.0s)]
*  In life you work for a bit. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=292.0s)]
*  You get fucking kicked to shit for years sometimes. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=294.0s)]
*  You've got to work and work and work. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=297.0s)]
*  And sometimes it's going to be really shitty for a long time. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=299.0s)]
*  And then there may be a reward. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=302.0s)]
*  Or there may not. Sometimes the work is the reward itself. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=304.0s)]
*  In some ways it actually changes how you think about achieving things. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=308.0s)]
*  And doing things as well. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=312.0s)]
*  I have sometimes found that helpful. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=314.0s)]
*  Because you kind of know if you work you get a reward. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=316.0s)]
*  But sometimes it can mess with your reward system as well I think. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=319.0s)]
*  You look at what video games do. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=323.0s)]
*  It encourages you to spend as much time doing them as possible. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=325.0s)]
*  The more you do them the more whatever you're doing you acquire. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=328.0s)]
*  That's kind of the case with real life. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=332.0s)]
*  Think about stock brokers. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=335.0s)]
*  Think about those kind of folks. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=337.0s)]
*  Folks are just in it trying to make money. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=339.0s)]
*  Just trying to figure out what to buy and what to sell. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=342.0s)]
*  For them it's all numbers. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=345.0s)]
*  So they must be addicted to these numbers. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=347.0s)]
*  They're probably super addicted to seeing their bank account. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=350.0s)]
*  Seeing their hedge funds. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=354.0s)]
*  What do they have? How much? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=356.0s)]
*  I need more than that. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=358.0s)]
*  You compare yourself and you read the list of the richest people in the world. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=360.0s)]
*  This guy's got 200 billion. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=364.0s)]
*  Holy shit I've got to do better. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=366.0s)]
*  How do you keep going once you've got to a billion? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=368.0s)]
*  How do you motivate yourself to make more? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=372.0s)]
*  You've got more money than you. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=374.0s)]
*  Unless what you're doing is what you enjoy doing. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=376.0s)]
*  Which is where Elon falls into that category. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=378.0s)]
*  He's making money but what he does is... [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=381.0s)]
*  Essentially it's all engineering stuff. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=384.0s)]
*  All of it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=387.0s)]
*  It's innovation and engineering. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=389.0s)]
*  The boring company that's trying to drill tunnels under the cities. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=391.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=395.0s)]
*  SpaceX, that's fucking insane. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=397.0s)]
*  You're shooting rockets into space. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=399.0s)]
*  You want to put people on Mars. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=401.0s)]
*  Electric cars, you're engineering electric cars. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=403.0s)]
*  Electric roofs. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=405.0s)]
*  Everything is like this new innovative product. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=407.0s)]
*  Starlink. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=409.0s)]
*  Oh let's just get high speed internet and fucking fly it through the sky. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=411.0s)]
*  People keep seeing those things and thinking they're UFOs by the way. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=414.0s)]
*  Do they? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=417.0s)]
*  It's also as well, if you think about making money. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=419.0s)]
*  What is really making money? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=422.0s)]
*  It's the deal. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=424.0s)]
*  And actually you just get addicted to the deal. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=426.0s)]
*  It's like a form of gambling. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=428.0s)]
*  I'm going to try this tactic. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=430.0s)]
*  But no, they push back on here. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=432.0s)]
*  But I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=434.0s)]
*  And then maybe if we try that then this is going to happen. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=436.0s)]
*  And then you make the deal and boom you get the dopamine. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=438.0s)]
*  Yeah, that makes sense. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=440.0s)]
*  I know some hedge fund guys who love doing it. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=442.0s)]
*  After the first billion too. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=444.0s)]
*  Well, if they really enjoy that game I guess. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=446.0s)]
*  I guess it's kind of like playing Magic the Gathering or something. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=449.0s)]
*  It is a game. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=453.0s)]
*  You're playing it to win it. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=456.0s)]
*  But social media is a game. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=458.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=460.0s)]
*  And it's a game a lot like video games. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=462.0s)]
*  Where it's like you're really not getting anything out of this. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=464.0s)]
*  And you're probably losing a lot of your time. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=466.0s)]
*  I suppose for people like us who are building profile and connections, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=470.0s)]
*  I've met so many amazing people actually through social media. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=475.0s)]
*  For sure. We're all on it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=478.0s)]
*  We're all on it. But also we're all on it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=480.0s)]
*  And some of the people that are on it aren't even really there. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=483.0s)]
*  There's so much interaction that's instigated. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=486.0s)]
*  There's so many inflammatory accounts that I read them and I'm like, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=490.0s)]
*  there is no way that's a real person. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=496.0s)]
*  This is all design. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=498.0s)]
*  There's just a certain percentage of people that are just trying to stir up shit [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=500.0s)]
*  in conversations all the time. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=504.0s)]
*  And they usually have American flags in their profile. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=506.0s)]
*  It's like some Trump thing in their name. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=509.0s)]
*  And then you go to their account. It doesn't look real at all. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=513.0s)]
*  And you're like, I wonder where this is. Is this guy in Moldova? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=516.0s)]
*  Where is he? Is he in Latvia? Where is this guy that's doing this? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=519.0s)]
*  There's so many people like that. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=524.0s)]
*  There's one guy, I'm not going to mention his name, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=526.0s)]
*  but he lives in Asia and he's always commenting about America. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=528.0s)]
*  And I'm like, mate, should you not be commenting about your own country [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=532.0s)]
*  instead of clipping riots in America? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=535.0s)]
*  Well, he got killed. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=538.0s)]
*  He's displaced protest. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=542.0s)]
*  Good fucking luck tweeting bad shit about China if you're in China. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=544.0s)]
*  They got that pretty locked down. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=549.0s)]
*  Oh, they do. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=551.0s)]
*  Yeah, and there's several countries that have arrested people for tweets. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=553.0s)]
*  Well, we come from one of them. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=558.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know. You guys do. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=560.0s)]
*  2018, 3,000 people, man. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=564.0s)]
*  3,000 people got arrested for tweeting bad things. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=566.0s)]
*  Not tweeting, but social media posts. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=568.0s)]
*  So between, what was the biggest one? It had to be Facebook, right? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=570.0s)]
*  That's where people complain the most. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=574.0s)]
*  Is it? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=576.0s)]
*  Probably. I think those are the complainiest folks. Those are the older folks. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=577.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the most famous example is Count Dankula, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=580.0s)]
*  the internet comedian where you taught his pug to do a Nazi salute. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=583.0s)]
*  But there's been lots of others, examples. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=587.0s)]
*  There's a tragic fire that happened in London called the Grenfell fire. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=590.0s)]
*  It was awful. People were literally burnt to death in this tower block. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=594.0s)]
*  And these group of people, they were idiots, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=597.0s)]
*  basically did a representation on bonfire night in November the 5th in our country. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=599.0s)]
*  And they did a representation of people in the tower and set fire to it. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=604.0s)]
*  They videoed it. They were laughing along. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=607.0s)]
*  Now, obviously, that's a dick move. I think we can all agree with that. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=609.0s)]
*  But you don't arrest somebody for that, for basically being a dick. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=612.0s)]
*  Yeah, it shouldn't be illegal to be stupid. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=616.0s)]
*  No. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=619.0s)]
*  You're crossing a line because you're making a subjective judgment. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=620.0s)]
*  You know, like, it's not funny to me, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=624.0s)]
*  and it's not funny probably to a lot of rational people. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=627.0s)]
*  But you should be able to try. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=631.0s)]
*  Like, the whole thing about doing something, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=633.0s)]
*  like a lot of times when people do outrageous things they think are going to be funny, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=636.0s)]
*  they don't know, and then they try it. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=639.0s)]
*  That's not a thing you should arrest people for. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=641.0s)]
*  Because you're setting a crazy precedent because then it becomes subjective. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=644.0s)]
*  Like, what's outrageous and what's not? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=649.0s)]
*  It could move to anything. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=651.0s)]
*  It could move to, you know, trans identification or trans rights. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=653.0s)]
*  It could move to anything. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=657.0s)]
*  Vaccine hesitancy. I mean, we can keep going. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=659.0s)]
*  Yeah, vaccine hesitancy, not supporting Ukraine. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=661.0s)]
*  There's a whole slew of things that could be stuffed into that box once you open it. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=664.0s)]
*  You just can't open that box. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=669.0s)]
*  You can't open that box. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=671.0s)]
*  That box has got to be, people have to be able to, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=672.0s)]
*  this is how we have to conduct ourselves. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=675.0s)]
*  People have to be able to express themselves. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=677.0s)]
*  And they have to be able to use facts and reality and not get censored. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=679.0s)]
*  And they have to be able to do that kind of universally. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=684.0s)]
*  And if they can't do that, if the good ideas can't compete against the bad ideas, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=687.0s)]
*  then the good ideas aren't good enough. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=691.0s)]
*  So we have to figure it out to strengthen the good ideas. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=693.0s)]
*  But the only way that works is if you don't censor people. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=695.0s)]
*  Because as soon as you start censoring people, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=699.0s)]
*  you're admitting that you don't want to engage in this. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=701.0s)]
*  You don't want to show a better way of looking at things. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=704.0s)]
*  You just want to be the only person who gets to talk. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=709.0s)]
*  And that's what we saw on social media over the last few years. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=711.0s)]
*  Which is why Elon buying Twitter was such a big fucking deal. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=715.0s)]
*  It's a big fucking deal. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=719.0s)]
*  And I know advertisers are panicking and people are saying that hate talk is up. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=720.0s)]
*  And I must admit, I have seen a lot of wild shit on X now [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=724.0s)]
*  that I don't think I would have ever seen before. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=729.0s)]
*  Openly racist stuff, some pretty gross stuff. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=731.0s)]
*  It's also just weird how comfortable people are talking a certain way. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=735.0s)]
*  It's almost like I wonder how much of the idea of it being completely uncensored now. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=741.0s)]
*  It's not totally uncensored. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=747.0s)]
*  There's some moderation. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=748.0s)]
*  There's things you can't do. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=749.0s)]
*  You can't dox people. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=750.0s)]
*  You can't do a lot of things. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=751.0s)]
*  And they can't catch everything either. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=752.0s)]
*  Didn't they fire like most people? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=754.0s)]
*  I mean nothing much changed though. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=756.0s)]
*  I didn't feel it terrible. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=759.0s)]
*  I think that in terms of the hate speech stuff or whatever you call that, whatever it is, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=761.0s)]
*  that's just a product of the fact that they're not moderating as much. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=765.0s)]
*  And I actually think, I mean what you said was just preach on that. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=768.0s)]
*  But I also think on top of that, we have to, those of us who believe in freedom of expression, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=771.0s)]
*  we have to also admit that freedom comes at a cost and it's worth paying. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=776.0s)]
*  That's what we have to be honest about, I think. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=781.0s)]
*  We have to say we're getting freedom at the cost of some discomfort. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=783.0s)]
*  Some people are allowed to be dicks. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=788.0s)]
*  And that's the price we're willing to pay. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=790.0s)]
*  I mean freedom always comes at a cost, right? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=792.0s)]
*  And it's trade-offs. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=794.0s)]
*  You could make the country really safe if you lock every man between 18 and 40 in a prison. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=795.0s)]
*  But we don't do that because we understand we can't do that, right? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=800.0s)]
*  Despite what some feminists want. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=803.0s)]
*  Statistically though, they'd be right. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=806.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=808.0s)]
*  Right, that's who commits the crimes. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=810.0s)]
*  Yeah, I used to have this bit about what would it be like if women caused all wars. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=812.0s)]
*  Because men caused all of them. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=817.0s)]
*  Men caused every fucking war that's ever happened. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=820.0s)]
*  Pretty much. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=822.0s)]
*  I mean maybe women were involved. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=823.0s)]
*  Well, I mean there's Helen of Troy. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=825.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=828.0s)]
*  But she wasn't out there fighting. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=829.0s)]
*  She just wanted to be with her true love, mate. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=831.0s)]
*  No, but it was her fault. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=833.0s)]
*  It was her fault. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=834.0s)]
*  That can be a factor. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=835.0s)]
*  There's really strong women in pussy whip kings. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=837.0s)]
*  A lot of that happens. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=840.0s)]
*  But for the most part, if you locked all the men up, yeah, right, there would be no crime. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=844.0s)]
*  Except in jail, there'd be a lot of crime in jail. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=849.0s)]
*  Let's stop giving them ideas, too. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=851.0s)]
*  Obviously you can't do that. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=857.0s)]
*  But it's also, it's like, how do we fix all of the like insane tension in the world today? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=858.0s)]
*  It seems like this is at no other time in my life have I felt like there's more conflict and more like tension in the air. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=870.0s)]
*  Like it didn't used to be that people with differing ideas, whether they're on the right or the left, were so fucking hateful. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=880.0s)]
*  So I could've seen the kind of rhetoric that you see online is just so like if we don't win, democracy is lost. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=888.0s)]
*  And it's from both sides. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=899.0s)]
*  I think the problem is, man, is that we spend all our time on these platforms, which incentivizes that type of behavior. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=900.0s)]
*  Because it's always going to be the most controversial take, the most reactionary point of view that's going to gain the most engagement. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=907.0s)]
*  And that's going to work with the algorithm, which is going to drive it. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=914.0s)]
*  So really, you know, people respond to incentives and you're incentivizing people to be more reactionary, more divisive, more aggressive. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=917.0s)]
*  When the reality is, as we all know, like if you got those two people to sit in front of one another and have a conversation, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=926.0s)]
*  they wouldn't behave like that because you have the added element of getting a punch in the face. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=932.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's another thing, right? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=937.0s)]
*  Like most people would never communicate the way they communicate online in real life. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=939.0s)]
*  And it's partly what Francis said, which is the potential for violence, right? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=944.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's real. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=948.0s)]
*  It's real. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=949.0s)]
*  And it's maybe a guy thing, but we instinctively know that, right? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=950.0s)]
*  Bill Burr used to have this incredible bit of how he would behave if it was illegal to, you know, if you couldn't hit him. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=954.0s)]
*  You know, just walk up to a Jim Bros, snap his milkshake out of his hand. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=960.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=965.0s)]
*  So the face to face thing changes everything because most of the way we communicate is actually not in the words, right? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=966.0s)]
*  This is how we're designed, right? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=971.0s)]
*  We're designed to communicate in person. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=973.0s)]
*  We're designed to take social cues, verbal cues, physical cues. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=976.0s)]
*  You can sense energy in people. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=980.0s)]
*  You can sense that people are upset with you, even though their expression doesn't change. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=983.0s)]
*  You know, it's interesting. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=986.0s)]
*  It's really interesting. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=988.0s)]
*  And we've also come to this point, Joe, which is really worrying to me, where people think that words of violence, you know, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=989.0s)]
*  and if you think the words of violence and if you literally interpret it as that, then you having an argument with someone is you literally being physically assaulted. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=996.0s)]
*  So if you're going, if you feel like you're being physically assaulted, then you're going to up the ante and you're going to become more aggressive as a result. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1005.0s)]
*  You're justified to defend yourself. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1011.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1013.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1014.0s)]
*  If you think that everyone is a Nazi, like a literal Nazi. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1015.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1017.0s)]
*  Like you feel justified in your actions. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1018.0s)]
*  And a lot of them are convinced of that. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1020.0s)]
*  It's like being in a cult. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1022.0s)]
*  But are they convinced of this? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1024.0s)]
*  This is what I wonder, Joe, is like they they keep using that word about everybody, right? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1025.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1030.0s)]
*  But if you actually thought democracy was over and the Nazis have taken over, wouldn't you like pick up a gun and rise up and overthrow the but but they don't. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1031.0s)]
*  Pretty close to that. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1039.0s)]
*  It seems like if you woke up one day and that broke out in Philadelphia, you wouldn't be stunned. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1042.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1047.0s)]
*  You know, you're seeing what the looting and the craziness of Philadelphia is right now. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1048.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1051.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's bonkers, man. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1052.0s)]
*  This defunded police stuff is psychotic. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1054.0s)]
*  It's crazy to literally encourage crime because if you don't have incentives, if you don't have something in place to keep people from committing crime and people that have already committed crime, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1058.0s)]
*  in their life, like multiple times, like many times, they're just going to do it whenever they want. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1070.0s)]
*  And that's what you're seeing. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1075.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1076.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1077.0s)]
*  It's amazing how and it's part of this sort of mindset that every human behavior is a product of the circumstances. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1078.0s)]
*  But it's not. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1084.0s)]
*  Some people will commit crime. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1085.0s)]
*  Right. And we have to also have a system that prevents that from happening. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1087.0s)]
*  We have to have police. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1090.0s)]
*  We have to have everything else. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1091.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1093.0s)]
*  And decriminalizing crime is a bad idea. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1094.0s)]
*  It's a stupid idea. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1097.0s)]
*  It's just this idea that's born out of guilt, not logic. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1099.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1102.0s)]
*  It's born out of virtue signaling, not rational thinking. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1103.0s)]
*  It's just not the way to do it. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1107.0s)]
*  If you have bad cops, you're supposed to train them to be better. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1109.0s)]
*  You should fund them better, treat them better, respect them more. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1112.0s)]
*  And then they should have more of a relationship with the community. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1115.0s)]
*  It should be a thing where they're trying to literally protect you, not constantly persecute people and fuck with people. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1118.0s)]
*  And it's like that line is a very thin line. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1124.0s)]
*  Then also, who the fuck wants that job? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1127.0s)]
*  Who the fuck wants to be yelled at all the time? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1130.0s)]
*  Who wants to be the professional enemy? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1132.0s)]
*  Who wants to be someone that it's okay to just shoot at? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1134.0s)]
*  Who wants to be the person that everybody you interact with is lying to you? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1136.0s)]
*  Was there a time in your life, Joe, where the police were respected by most people? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1140.0s)]
*  There's always been problems. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1145.0s)]
*  You know, there was a problem. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1147.0s)]
*  Hunter S. Thompson wrote about the Chicago riots being one of the most horrific things that he ever saw in his life, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1148.0s)]
*  the way cops were beating the people with clubs and shit. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1152.0s)]
*  There's always been bad cops, just like there's always been bad plumbers. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1157.0s)]
*  Some people just suck. They suck at what they do. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1162.0s)]
*  They come from a bad environment. They didn't have good role models. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1166.0s)]
*  They grew up around assholes. They don't have any motivation. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1170.0s)]
*  Maybe they're hooked on drugs, and they suck at what they do. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1173.0s)]
*  And that could be anything. Anybody could suck at anything. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1175.0s)]
*  Cops, too. There's cops that are awesome human beings. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1180.0s)]
*  I know a lot of cops. They're great people. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1183.0s)]
*  From Jiu-Jitsu, I've known so many cops, because cops are constantly training. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1185.0s)]
*  And generally, they're really nice guys with a fucking really hard job, but you don't hear about those. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1190.0s)]
*  You hear about the one that does some horrible thing. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1196.0s)]
*  You see about the one who plants the gun on the guy after he shoots him. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1199.0s)]
*  You see the one where people shoot people when they're reaching for their wallets. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1203.0s)]
*  You see the crazy shit. You see people punching women in the face. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1207.0s)]
*  You see crazy shit, right? But you don't see all the positive interactions. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1211.0s)]
*  And you don't see what happens if you get rid of them. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1215.0s)]
*  And that's what you're seeing with these smash and grabs. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1219.0s)]
*  These are fucking bananas, man, because they're everywhere now. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1222.0s)]
*  And people are seeing so many of them on the internet, and they're seeing that people are getting away with them. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1226.0s)]
*  And it's encouraging them. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1230.0s)]
*  And this is what happened. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1232.0s)]
*  Venezuela always had a problem with lawlessness. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1234.0s)]
*  But when Chávez came to power, after a few years, they said the cops weren't going to prosecute people, criminals, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1237.0s)]
*  because prosecuting a crime is a sign of right-wing oppression. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1244.0s)]
*  Wherever you heard that before. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1248.0s)]
*  And as a result of that, it became so completely and utterly lawless, the city became uninhabitable. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1250.0s)]
*  It became the murder capital of the world and the kidnap capital of the world. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1257.0s)]
*  Because there's always going to be a small subset of society who are criminals, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1260.0s)]
*  and who will then look to maximize their opportunities to make money. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1265.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a couple arguments about this that make sense. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1270.0s)]
*  When people say that they're a victim of their circumstance, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1275.0s)]
*  and we have to appreciate that they were put into a horrible circumstance in life, and they're just trying to get by. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1279.0s)]
*  That's true, too. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1285.0s)]
*  So what we have to do that we're not doing is try to figure out how to stop that. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1286.0s)]
*  How to make a minimum quality of life for everybody, where no one's growing up in dire poverty. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1291.0s)]
*  If you can send... [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1300.0s)]
*  I mean, how many trillions of dollars have we spent just on military budgets over the last few years? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1302.0s)]
*  If they figured out a way to give contractors a lot of money to fix neighborhoods, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1309.0s)]
*  like to completely clean them up, provide modern housing, take care of all the... [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1317.0s)]
*  Figure out ways to set people up for work programs and give people jobs. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1325.0s)]
*  If that was financially viable, just like Hal Burton had those contracts to rebuild Iraq after we blew it up. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1330.0s)]
*  If they had something like that for inner cities where these guys could literally make money doing it, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1337.0s)]
*  that could be one way to kind of re-engineer things. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1342.0s)]
*  Because if they could just figure out how to do that, you'd have so much less crime. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1346.0s)]
*  You'd have a lot less crime. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1350.0s)]
*  You'd have a lot less crime. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1352.0s)]
*  If people had hope, if people had role models, if they had community centers, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1353.0s)]
*  if they had really good education and they had safe streets. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1358.0s)]
*  Just that alone. Just that alone. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1360.0s)]
*  Yeah, it would reduce crime a lot, definitely. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1363.0s)]
*  It would take a long fucking time though. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1365.0s)]
*  Because you've got generation after generation of people who live there. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1367.0s)]
*  When you're talking about really fucked up, gang-ridden neighborhoods, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1370.0s)]
*  no one's done anything about those neighborhoods for a long time. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1374.0s)]
*  It's generational. It's built into the people that live there. They're accustomed to it. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1377.0s)]
*  And there's family structure as well. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1382.0s)]
*  Once you disrupt all that, there's not enough male role models. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1384.0s)]
*  Where are young kids going to look for a role model? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1387.0s)]
*  It's going to be the men with status around them. Who's that going to be? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1390.0s)]
*  Drug dealers. Gang members. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1394.0s)]
*  Status and money. That's them. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1396.0s)]
*  And guys who grew up in those kind of neighborhoods all have that story. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1398.0s)]
*  And that's true too. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1402.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can't defund the police, but you also can't ignore the plight of a good percentage of our community. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1404.0s)]
*  We're supposed to be a united community of human beings. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1412.0s)]
*  We call ourselves Americans. We live on the same patch of land, except for Alaska and Hawaii. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1415.0s)]
*  Alaska's the dumbest. How is that ours? It's not even connected. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1419.0s)]
*  People don't talk about the culture aspect about it a lot. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1426.0s)]
*  I remember when I was teaching at a school, it was a really rough school. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1429.0s)]
*  I taught a kid, let's call him Darren. It's one of the smartest kids I've ever encountered. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1432.0s)]
*  So bright. I remember he was always getting kicked out of lessons. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1437.0s)]
*  And one of the jobs that you do as a teacher is you walk around the corridor and you pick up the kids who get kicked out of the lesson. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1441.0s)]
*  And I then taught Darren chess. And within about two days he could beat me at chess. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1448.0s)]
*  He was super, super, super bright. One of the brightest kids I've ever encountered. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1454.0s)]
*  But because he came from a criminal family, he was never going to make it through school. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1459.0s)]
*  He just wasn't because the values that had been inculcated him right the way from birth meant that he was never going to succeed. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1463.0s)]
*  And this is what I found frustrating that a lot of people didn't get. They were like, he's a bad kid. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1471.0s)]
*  He's a kid who's a product of his culture. And it takes a very special person to be able to break out of that. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1476.0s)]
*  And generally they have to find something to break out, whether it's music or sports or something that breaks them out. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1483.0s)]
*  Stand-up comedy that breaks them out of that. Some new world that they can enter into and succeed in. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1490.0s)]
*  And then they can leave the old world behind. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1496.0s)]
*  And at the same time, coming back to the point you made earlier, crime still has to be illegal. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1498.0s)]
*  We can understand people's circumstances and not encourage and incentivize them to commit crime. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1504.0s)]
*  We have to be able to do both. We have to walk and chew gum at the same time, man. We've got to be. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1509.0s)]
*  We have to be. We have to be able to do both. But the way to fix it is not defunding the police. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1514.0s)]
*  That's the worst strategy. But that's such a virtue signaling strategy. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1519.0s)]
*  That's like, look what they did to George Floyd. No, look what one guy did. One guy did. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1525.0s)]
*  And there was a more than appropriate response by the people that saw that video. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1531.0s)]
*  The violence and the burning and all that smashing and shit. Very unfortunate. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1535.0s)]
*  But that out blast of hate at least should make people recognize that, A, you can be held responsible for something horrific like that if someone's filming it. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1541.0s)]
*  And then also that those kind of cops do exist. And also that it's on all of them. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1552.0s)]
*  And we've got to figure out a way to train cops or screen them better. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1558.0s)]
*  Like Jaco says that you should train them the same way you train SEALs. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1563.0s)]
*  Like SEALs develop, they go through this training program and then they dedicate a certain amount of time forever for training. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1568.0s)]
*  They're always training. Cops don't do that. They just stay cops. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1575.0s)]
*  And he's like, you should dedicate a certain percentage of their time should be dedicated to training. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1579.0s)]
*  And they should be held accountable. But it's also it's like you're asking a lot. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1585.0s)]
*  And then on top of that, you're essentially dealing with people that have a high instance of PTSD. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1589.0s)]
*  Oh, very, very high instance and not discussed and not appreciated. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1595.0s)]
*  You hear about PTSD from people that are victims of violence and people that are victims of war. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1600.0s)]
*  You hear about that, but you don't hear about it about cops. Yeah. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1605.0s)]
*  And also the point you made earlier. I mean, how much does it how much does it take to train a SEAL? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1608.0s)]
*  Yeah, it takes a lot. Right. How much does it? [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1613.0s)]
*  How much do we spend training police officers? Not nearly as much. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1616.0s)]
*  And also like, hey, you shouldn't be fat like, hey, if you also you should be able to physically defend yourself. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1619.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, and even if you're a woman, you should know Jiu Jitsu. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1627.0s)]
*  You should know you should be able to defend yourself because we've seen time and time again these horrific situations [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1630.0s)]
*  where cops can't physically defend themselves and some criminal gets loose and beats the fuck out of them. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1637.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I've seen so many videos of this. One was horrible. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1643.0s)]
*  This lady pulled this guy over and the guy's daughter was in the car. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1647.0s)]
*  She's like, don't, daddy, don't, daddy. And he's beating the fuck out of this lady cop. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1651.0s)]
*  You know, when I left university, I did a like a temp job at the Metropolitan Police just doing like paperwork. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1655.0s)]
*  And what was really interesting when I was working those offices is there were a lot of cops there working and they were all just guys who were burnt out, PTSD out of their eyeballs. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1663.0s)]
*  They couldn't function anymore. And all they all they did was just routine admin jobs. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1672.0s)]
*  And I used to go with these guys to go and drink and like really good guys, really good guys. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1677.0s)]
*  And the stories they told me that just horrific and the drinking culture and the only way a lot of these guys were functioning [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1683.0s)]
*  is by working most of them. You know, they had one or two marriages, they had failed, and then they would just go out and just get smashed because that was their only way of coping. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1692.0s)]
*  Because the support for them was minimal. They didn't have any support. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1704.0s)]
*  If you go to a murder scene and you see, you know, a guy who's basically killed himself and then shot his daughter and his wife, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1709.0s)]
*  and you don't have any type of support when you come out to talk to to help you to process that. What are you going to do? You're not meant to be exposed to that. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1719.0s)]
*  All the time. All the time. That's all you do. That's all you do. Yeah. And we don't even consider that. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1728.0s)]
*  It's just such a stupid underappreciation. And it's just so unfortunate that that's so prevalent. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1735.0s)]
*  And it's somehow or another equated to liberalism. And I just think it's just the wrong approach. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1744.0s)]
*  I think it's like fundamentally it's the wrong approach. I empathize and I even agree with how they feel about the way the setup in this country is not fair. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1752.0s)]
*  It's not fair. There are people that do not get a fair starting block. Their starting block sucks. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1764.0s)]
*  Like where they take off from in life, it's not the same as yours. It's not the same as mine. But we got to fix that. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1771.0s)]
*  The thing is not like fixing it when it gets to all the way to letting violent criminals out because you think they were wronged in life. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1778.0s)]
*  You're just going to let violent criminals out. Then you're not changing them because you acknowledge the fact that they've been done wrong. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1786.0s)]
*  And also we have to be real in a society like yours and like ours where we define poverty. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1793.0s)]
*  Look, the communities you're talking about, they're really in deep trouble of course. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1798.0s)]
*  But we still define poverty in relative terms and somebody will always be poorer than other people. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1803.0s)]
*  Yes, but like dire poverty, food stamps, welfare, you don't have money for food. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1808.0s)]
*  I know, but those people are much wealthier than many of the people I grew up around. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1814.0s)]
*  Which is crazy, right? It's 34,000 dollars a year is 1% of the world. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1818.0s)]
*  People call themselves like, you know, these 1% are, bitch, that's you. That's you. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1825.0s)]
*  Right, that's everybody here. That's all of us. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1830.0s)]
*  Especially most people working make more than 34,000 dollars a year. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1833.0s)]
*  So most people in America that have a full-time job, they're probably making more than 34,000 dollars a year and they're in the top 1% of the world. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1837.0s)]
*  You know the thing that I don't think people talk about enough. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1845.0s)]
*  So when I was teaching, I taught in rural communities. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1849.0s)]
*  And in a lot of rural communities, because of globalization, because of deindustrialization, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1853.0s)]
*  there's just generation after generation who are growing up, who are becoming adults, and there is no work. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1858.0s)]
*  There is no work for the vast majority of them. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1864.0s)]
*  And what it inculcates in them is a sense of hopelessness. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1867.0s)]
*  And if you grew up in a culture where you feel that there is no hope, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1870.0s)]
*  and you look around you and everyone is broken, and no one is working, and everyone is giving up, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1874.0s)]
*  then even as a kid you think to yourself, well, what's the point of doing anything? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1879.0s)]
*  Because I'm just going to end up like Uncle Dave on the sofa, you know what I mean? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1883.0s)]
*  Even if you don't intellectually think it, emotionally you feel it. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1888.0s)]
*  Well, that's a thing that can happen to kids in high school. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1893.0s)]
*  So if you're in high school and you're hanging around with a crowd who likes to party and drink [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1896.0s)]
*  and fuck off and not do much, and those are the fun people to hang out with, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1901.0s)]
*  and then you get out of school and now you're supposed to get a job. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1906.0s)]
*  Now you're on your own. You have to figure it out. And these guys aren't figuring it out. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1910.0s)]
*  If you're trapped in that kind of a friend group, you can get sucked into very low expectations. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1914.0s)]
*  And you could fucking waste a long chunk of your life before you figure that out. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1920.0s)]
*  And culture, you're right, Francis, is such a powerful thing. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1925.0s)]
*  When I was 18, I spent a few weeks sleeping in the park. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1928.0s)]
*  I didn't have money and I had a long family situation that was very bad. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1933.0s)]
*  But it never occurred to me that I would stay there because that wasn't what I came from [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1938.0s)]
*  and it wasn't the environment I was raised in. I always knew that I would get out of it. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1942.0s)]
*  And culture, whatever attitude, whatever you want to call it, will push you through things [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1946.0s)]
*  that if you don't have it, it's going to be impossible. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1951.0s)]
*  If you don't have expectations, you don't know people that have succeeded in life and done well. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1954.0s)]
*  That's a better word, expectations, than culture. Expectations. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1960.0s)]
*  If you're in a fucking place like South Side of Chicago, have you ever looked at the murder rate? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1964.0s)]
*  Man, it's heartbreaking. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1969.0s)]
*  There are so many crazy videos of shootouts in the street. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1971.0s)]
*  I just watched one the other day. A guy pulls over, jumps out of the car, shoots these guys. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1974.0s)]
*  It's just happening on the street. These kids are growing up in a war zone. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1979.0s)]
*  So if you're a kid and you're growing up there and you're 15 years old, how many people have you seen killed? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1984.0s)]
*  Three, four, five? How many have you seen killed? [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1988.0s)]
*  Are you out at night? Are you at 13 years old? Are you roaming around the streets at night being wild? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1991.0s)]
*  Are you seeing gang violence? Are you participating in it? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=1997.0s)]
*  And what do you want as a young man? You want status? You want money? You want girls? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2001.0s)]
*  Who are the people, all the people that you see around you, who are the people that have that? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2007.0s)]
*  Also, it's probably pretty fucking exciting. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2012.0s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2014.0s)]
*  Shoot some guns, yeah. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2017.0s)]
*  A lot better than working at Lowe's. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2018.0s)]
*  When I was, again, I was working in East London. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2020.0s)]
*  And one of the, this is the thing, because I try always to have compassion for people. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2024.0s)]
*  Obviously, you're human sometimes, you're just like, you're a fuck. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2030.0s)]
*  But the thing that I found most heartbreaking, man, is like, there were kids in my class who I taught, they had learning difficulties, they were, you know, they, you know, they're low IQ, they weren't particularly bright, they were sweet kids. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2033.0s)]
*  And they were just targeted by gangs, because gangs knew that they could groom them, that they were 10, 11 years old, there was no one at home, no one cared for them, they could groom them, and then they could become drug runners and whatever else. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2045.0s)]
*  You know, my ex was an educational psychologist, she was working with a lot of these kids. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2058.0s)]
*  One of her kids, like, went missing. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2063.0s)]
*  The kid went missing, 10, 11 years old. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2065.0s)]
*  This was in North London, she was working. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2067.0s)]
*  The kid was found in Scotland. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2069.0s)]
*  Literally a different country at the other end of the island. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2072.0s)]
*  And you're like, you know, and it was gang, it was gang. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2075.0s)]
*  You know, because they take them, they groom them, they give them money, they're the first person who shows them affection, the first person to show. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2078.0s)]
*  You know what? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2084.0s)]
*  You know what? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2085.0s)]
*  Everybody else has written you off, everyone else thinks you're stupid, but you know what? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2086.0s)]
*  Come and join us, come and join us, I'll show you respect. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2089.0s)]
*  I'm going to give you responsibility, and you know what else you're going to do? [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2093.0s)]
*  You're going to get money. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2096.0s)]
*  Here's a question. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2098.0s)]
*  We all have, we all have this vision of a utopian society, where there is no longer war, there is no longer crime, but it's never existed. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2100.0s)]
*  It's never existed even briefly. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2111.0s)]
*  Isn't it, is there something that human beings, it's almost like built into the operating system of human beings, that you need a certain amount of antagonists, a certain amount of protagonists to keep things moving? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2113.0s)]
*  And that the urgency that everybody feels right now is like social urgency. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2129.0s)]
*  It's almost like we're building up to like an ideological Super Bowl. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2134.0s)]
*  Like we're going to figure out which one of these ideas makes the most sense. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2138.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2143.0s)]
*  It's like, it feels like there's like this tension build up. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2144.0s)]
*  I almost wonder if that's something that we need in order to figure things out. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2147.0s)]
*  Like we need this chaos. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2153.0s)]
*  We need people trying to control narratives. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2155.0s)]
*  We need people trying to censor people. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2156.0s)]
*  We need people to do it so we realize how horrific it is, so we act out and we talk about it. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2158.0s)]
*  So it's not like this slow, creeping censorship where you don't notice it. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2162.0s)]
*  It's shocking. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2167.0s)]
*  They're censoring news stories that could hurt the party that they want to win in the elections. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2168.0s)]
*  It's crazy stuff. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2175.0s)]
*  It is crazy. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2176.0s)]
*  And we had the case with debanking in the UK where this guy, Nigel Farage, I don't know if you know him. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2177.0s)]
*  I did hear about that story. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2181.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's kind of like the Donald Trump of the UK in some ways, you know, very unpopular with some things, with some people very popular with others. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2183.0s)]
*  And his bank, which was a kind of like bank for wealthy people, they closed his account without explaining why. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2190.0s)]
*  He started doing some digging. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2197.0s)]
*  He did a freedom of information request or something. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2200.0s)]
*  It's not called that, but it's basically the same thing. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2202.0s)]
*  And the bank came out and said it's because he doesn't have enough money. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2204.0s)]
*  Bullshit turned out it wasn't true. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2209.0s)]
*  Eventually, he got the information saying that the transcripts of their internal conversations were that part of the reason they shut his account down was because they didn't want to do it. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2211.0s)]
*  And that part of the reason they shut his account down was political. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2220.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2223.0s)]
*  And then we had the Financial Conduct Authority, which is the people who are supposed to investigate this stuff. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2224.0s)]
*  They did an investigation and said there was no political debanking going on. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2229.0s)]
*  All the newspapers reported it. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2233.0s)]
*  And in paragraph five of that same article, you can see that his case was not taken into account in the report. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2235.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2241.0s)]
*  So they lied about it stage after stage after stage. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2242.0s)]
*  And they're spreading this crap that they know isn't true. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2246.0s)]
*  All they have to do is have a good headline. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2249.0s)]
*  All they have to do is have a good headline. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2251.0s)]
*  The inside of it can be nonsense. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2253.0s)]
*  And they can even show you right in front of your face why what they're saying is incorrect. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2255.0s)]
*  And it doesn't matter. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2259.0s)]
*  And then they all bitch and whine. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2260.0s)]
*  And then they go, why is no one watching our content? [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2262.0s)]
*  Well, here's the wildest one that's going on right now. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2264.0s)]
*  You know, the Mar-a-Lago controversy of the pricing or the inflated value of the house. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2267.0s)]
*  The Mar-a-Lago. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2273.0s)]
*  The judge ruled that it was worth 18 million. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2274.0s)]
*  It's 20 acres in like the most expensive real estate in that area. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2277.0s)]
*  Like a house down the street from it, much smaller. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2282.0s)]
*  Just sold for 50 million dollars. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2284.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2286.0s)]
*  Even if Forbes said it's worth somewhere between, I think, see what Forbes said. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2287.0s)]
*  I think they said it was worth between 300 and 700 million dollars. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2291.0s)]
*  And they were saying that it's worth 18 million. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2294.0s)]
*  It's like they don't even try to pretend. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2303.0s)]
*  Why does no one trust the mainstream? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2305.0s)]
*  If the guy says his house is worth a billion dollars, right? [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2307.0s)]
*  And then you come along and say, no, no, no, it's worth like 800 million. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2310.0s)]
*  Forbes says it's worth as much as 700 million. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2313.0s)]
*  We'll call it 700 million. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2316.0s)]
*  Now you've got a reasonable argument. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2317.0s)]
*  But if you say 18 million, like you've got to know that's a palace. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2319.0s)]
*  The place is a palace. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2324.0s)]
*  It's 20 acres. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2325.0s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2327.0s)]
*  This is great. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2328.0s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2329.0s)]
*  That's like too obvious. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2330.0s)]
*  You don't give a fuck about the truth. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2331.0s)]
*  They don't. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2334.0s)]
*  You don't give a fuck about the truth. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2335.0s)]
*  He claimed it was worth 1.5 billion in latest pleaded drop fraud case. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2336.0s)]
*  But judge ruled it's wildly inflated. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2340.0s)]
*  Yeah, but the judge does not have an accurate sense of the market, in my opinion. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2343.0s)]
*  Just the property size alone. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2349.0s)]
*  It's such a giant chunk of property. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2352.0s)]
*  So that says it's worth somewhere about half a bill, right? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2355.0s)]
*  Is that what that's saying? [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2359.0s)]
*  No. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2360.0s)]
*  See, the judge was saying that it's worth between... [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2361.0s)]
*  Okay, citing an appraisal report from the city of Palm Beach that pegged the value of Mar-a-Lago [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2365.0s)]
*  between 18 million and 27.6 million between 2011 and 2021. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2371.0s)]
*  Okay, so it was 18 million. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2376.0s)]
*  Now it's worth because of inflation, 27. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2378.0s)]
*  325 million. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2382.0s)]
*  That's how much Forbes estimated Mar-a-Lago is worth as of September. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2384.0s)]
*  Although it pegged its net value at 292 million after deducting roughly 33 million in debt. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2388.0s)]
*  Okay, so it's got debt. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2393.0s)]
*  So I think what they're saying the scam is, is you wildly overinflate a piece of real estate. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2395.0s)]
*  Again, I don't know jack shit about real estate. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2401.0s)]
*  But I think what you do is you say, I got a house worth a billion dollars. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2404.0s)]
*  I need a loan. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2408.0s)]
*  They give you a loan based on this billion dollar property you have. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2409.0s)]
*  But if then they send an appraiser to you and say, hey, but this house is worth 18 million. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2413.0s)]
*  Then you're like, uh-oh. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2417.0s)]
*  So now you really got a loan, but you got a loan based on something that's not really worth as much. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2419.0s)]
*  So their collateral or whatever it is, the reason why they would give you that much money doesn't make any sense. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2424.0s)]
*  But clearly that can't be accurate. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2430.0s)]
*  If you're seeing pictures of that fucking place, show some photos of Mar-a-Lago. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2432.0s)]
*  If that was 18 million, dudes would be buying them every day. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2437.0s)]
*  It would last three seconds on the market before somebody bought it. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2440.0s)]
*  People would just be calling up. The phone lines would get jammed. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2444.0s)]
*  I'll take it. Sight unseen. I'll take it. 18 million? Even 27 million. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2447.0s)]
*  Calling a 1.5 billion is a Trump thing to say. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2453.0s)]
*  My favorite thing about the whole speech is he talks about himself in the third person. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2456.0s)]
*  The judge hates Trump. That's what he keeps saying. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2462.0s)]
*  That is it. That's a nice house. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2465.0s)]
*  It's a fucking palace, man. Look at that place. It's insane. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2467.0s)]
*  It's insane. And the inside of it is all like, click on that photo of Trump there with his chandelier. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2472.0s)]
*  Look how fucking beautiful it is inside. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2477.0s)]
*  That is ridiculous. I mean, look, maybe it's me being a Brit, but I look at it and go, it's a bit fucking much, though. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2480.0s)]
*  Oh, it's a lot much. It's not my style. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2486.0s)]
*  That looks like something out of a Russian czar's house. You know what I mean? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2490.0s)]
*  Yes! That's what I like about it. That's what I want Trump's house to look like. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2493.0s)]
*  If Trump lived in some bullshit fucking log cabin, I'd be so disappointed. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2497.0s)]
*  Trump lived in fucking John Dutton's house on Yellowstone. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2501.0s)]
*  What are you doing, bro? You should be ballin'! [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2505.0s)]
*  That's on brand, as we say. That's on brand. What a house, man. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2507.0s)]
*  Look at the size of that property. So those little houses around there are selling for like $30 billion. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2510.0s)]
*  That's crazy expensive property there. To think that that's only worth $18 million to $27 million, that seems a little insane. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2516.0s)]
*  You know the thing that always gets me, man, is like, you're reading the mainstream media and they criticize our podcast [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2523.0s)]
*  and your show and then they go, these people spread misinformation. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2530.0s)]
*  I'm like, mate, what are you talking about? You've been spreading misinformation from day one. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2535.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's like getting a lecture on dating from Ted Bundy. You're like, mate, come on. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2542.0s)]
*  Yeah, it seems crazy for them to keep harping on that at this point. It's like, don't you know about the internet? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2548.0s)]
*  People have made compilation videos of you guys being wrong over and over and over and over again, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2555.0s)]
*  and you've never apologized for it. I mean, whatever you want to talk about, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2561.0s)]
*  whether it's the Russia collusion thing or the saying the dangers of Trump denying the election, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2565.0s)]
*  then you show how many people denied Trump's election. Call him the illegitimate president. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2571.0s)]
*  Hillary called him an illegitimate president. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2576.0s)]
*  Yeah, they said he stole the election. Like, if you think that's dangerous from him, then it's dangerous from you too. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2579.0s)]
*  And we should all acknowledge that we should try to figure out a way to make the elections as fair as possible. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2584.0s)]
*  My real fear is that not everybody's on board with that. That's my real fear. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2590.0s)]
*  I would love to believe that everybody on the right and everybody on the left just wants a fair battle, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2596.0s)]
*  and they just want to be able to speak their mind to the public and have the people choose. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2603.0s)]
*  That's what I would like to believe, and that we would like to encourage all Americans to vote. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2608.0s)]
*  Everyone should just get informed and go out there and give your opinion. Let's see how the country feels. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2613.0s)]
*  But I don't know how much shenanigans is going on. You know there's a little collusion between social media companies. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2620.0s)]
*  We know that now. That's kind of scary. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2629.0s)]
*  That's kind of scary that you would think that what you believe is so important that you're willing to manipulate an election. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2632.0s)]
*  That scares you. It should scare us. Because it's like, man, they could use that on you. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2638.0s)]
*  I mean, we could have this. Imagine if we have this fucking amazing person who's running for president, and like, finally, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2644.0s)]
*  all rational people in the center, people that are rational on the right and the left, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2650.0s)]
*  agree that this person has the country's best ideas in mind, and we've made awesome progress with the way this person is communicating with everybody, [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2655.0s)]
*  and it seems like they could really unite us. And they get fucked. Somebody comes in and just manipulates it, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2664.0s)]
*  doesn't like the idea of some new person taking charge, doesn't like the idea of some radical thinker [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2670.0s)]
*  who wants to try to make things as good as possible for the whole country, and that maybe there's a way to do that. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2677.0s)]
*  And they get fucked by some establishment spokesperson because they know how to manipulate the system. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2685.0s)]
*  And look at the people that rise to the top in the current system in your country and in ours. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2692.0s)]
*  I mean, the idea that these two people, whoever they end up being, if it's Biden and Trump, let's say, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2697.0s)]
*  these are the best people out of 320 million fucking people? [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2701.0s)]
*  Well, the thing about Biden is he's already won, right? So he is the president. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2705.0s)]
*  So it only makes sense that he runs for president if he's physically capable of doing that. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2708.0s)]
*  The thing about Trump is there's, you know, the narrative that he and a lot of his followers put out is that the election was rigged [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2713.0s)]
*  and that, you know, he should be the legitimate president anyway, and no one else is, there's no one's voting for anybody else. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2722.0s)]
*  Like these hardcore Trumpers, they're going to go all in on Trump. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2731.0s)]
*  So it's like, OK, how else could it be other than Trump versus Biden, unless they arrest Trump, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2735.0s)]
*  unless they figure out a way to make some of these charges stick? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2740.0s)]
*  And here's the thing with Trump, you know, you know, to him, this is no longer a presidential race. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2743.0s)]
*  To him, this is existential because this is probably the only chance he's going to have of avoiding jail. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2750.0s)]
*  So you look at it like that and you think Trump is already a guy who, let's put it bluntly and mildly, will do whatever it takes to win. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2758.0s)]
*  And if you put a guy like that and you say the only way that you're going to avoid jail is to win the presidency, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2767.0s)]
*  you're already notching it up a few ratchet when it comes to making the atmosphere really toxic. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2776.0s)]
*  And you can play that argument the other way. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2782.0s)]
*  I mean, in terms of Biden and the investigations that are happening, Donald Trump gets elected. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2784.0s)]
*  What is he going to do? They would argue that too, right? [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2788.0s)]
*  Yeah. The Biden thing is fascinating to watch people ignore it. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2791.0s)]
*  Did you see Noam Dwarman's interview with that guy? [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2795.0s)]
*  No, I did not. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2799.0s)]
*  Oh man, it's Noam Dwarman from The Comedy Cellar. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2800.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2803.0s)]
*  He had a guy on his podcast who he billed up as like the most sane guy who says that the Hunter Biden thing was a nothing burger. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2804.0s)]
*  And they went round for like an hour and the guy just would not... [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2812.0s)]
*  It was the craziest thing that I've ever seen. I'll send it to you. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2816.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2820.0s)]
*  It's a journal from The Washington Post. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2821.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2823.0s)]
*  He thinks it's nothing. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2824.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2825.0s)]
*  But when... [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2826.0s)]
*  Is he doing mental gymnastics? [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2827.0s)]
*  Yeah. So when Noam essentially corners him and goes, no, no, look at this, look at this, the guy just, he just, he wants to leave. That's it. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2828.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's a fucking live wire for them. They don't want to touch that. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2836.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2841.0s)]
*  You know, it's like there's really no defending it rationally. So if you're on the team that has to defend the left, which, you know, you've all seen people like that on podcasts before where you realize, oh, this guy's just, this isn't like a real person. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2842.0s)]
*  This is a representative of whatever they're for, whether it's the right or the left. You know, there's people like that where you never really see them. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2852.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2860.0s)]
*  You know, they have walls. And what they're doing is just like speaking that kind of language. There's always going to be people like that. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2861.0s)]
*  We've got to get back, or not back, I don't think we were ever there, but we've got to get somehow the idea that truth matters, man. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2868.0s)]
*  And it doesn't matter what fucking team you're on, the truth matters if you're left, right, up, down, whatever. The truth matters. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2874.0s)]
*  I think that's what we're doing right now. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2878.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2879.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2880.0s)]
*  I think that's what we do. And that's one of the reasons why your show works. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2881.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2883.0s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons why this show works is because people can just talk. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2884.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2886.0s)]
*  And they can do so in a way that you really, it's not available anywhere else. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2887.0s)]
*  The reason why people are so hungry for these kind of conversations on podcasts is because you can't get it anywhere else. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2891.0s)]
*  Like these other people aren't doing it. They're doing a different thing. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2896.0s)]
*  They're doing a thing where there's a giant business behind it and there's advertisers and there's a bunch of executives and producers and they all have segments that they've developed and there's writers and everyone. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2899.0s)]
*  And then you get to express yourself sort of through this very narrow window to be able to just sit and shoot the shit and just just say, why is this and why is that? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2908.0s)]
*  And what is this and what is that? Like that kind of freedom to do that. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2919.0s)]
*  It's never existed before. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2922.0s)]
*  No. And they're all terrified of a Twitter storm. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2924.0s)]
*  They're all terrified of a Twitter storm. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2927.0s)]
*  You see it in our politics, you know, where somebody says something like the hot topic at the moment is immigration, particularly illegal immigration. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2929.0s)]
*  So there's a lot of people coming from France to the UK illegally. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2937.0s)]
*  They just jump in a boat from France illegally. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2942.0s)]
*  And these it's run by cartels and gangs. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2945.0s)]
*  And the really sad thing is some of these people actually drown in the English Channel as a result. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2949.0s)]
*  And they come and they come to the UK. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2954.0s)]
*  This needs to stop. You just can't have unfiltered illegal immigration. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2957.0s)]
*  You get people on and politicians to go, look, we need to stop this. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2961.0s)]
*  And then people are calling. They're saying that they're, you know, one put very famous ex sportsman compares that to Nazi Germany. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2965.0s)]
*  It's like, why is it happening in this big rush? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2974.0s)]
*  Is this engineered? Like, why is it happening like this? [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2979.0s)]
*  Like, what is it about this? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2982.0s)]
*  It seems like at least some people want to keep the borders open. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2986.0s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like it seems like something's changed where they've made it easier for people to just come across. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2991.0s)]
*  Yeah. So what happened? [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=2998.0s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3001.0s)]
*  And then what is this crazy push where you want people to not have ID to vote, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3002.0s)]
*  but you want people to have ID to make sure you have a vaccine passport or you can't work or get on a plane? [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3010.0s)]
*  And did you check any of these people to see if they're vaccinated when they came aboard? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3016.0s)]
*  You really didn't, did you? So what do we do in here? [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3020.0s)]
*  It's crazy. It's like hundreds of thousands of people a month. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3024.0s)]
*  It's crazy. You brought it up earlier. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3028.0s)]
*  I think we talked about this last time with, you know, Thomas Soule, who's just like, I mean, he's a I love I've read every book that he's ever published. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3030.0s)]
*  I just think he's amazing. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3037.0s)]
*  You know, we talked about the tragic vision versus the slightly more utopian way of looking at things. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3038.0s)]
*  You know, when you were talking about crime earlier, the tragic vision of life kind of says, if you look back at our history, [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3044.0s)]
*  you kind of get a sense of what human beings are. Yeah. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3050.0s)]
*  And human beings are flawed. They're not perfect. They will commit crime. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3054.0s)]
*  They will do terrible things. They will go to war. They will do that. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3058.0s)]
*  And so the only thing you can do is know that and then act accordingly. Right. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3062.0s)]
*  That means that you have to have a border. That means you have to have a police force. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3066.0s)]
*  You have to recognize the fallibility of human beings and the societal dynamics as well. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3070.0s)]
*  And then you can make good policy. That's how you make good policy. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3075.0s)]
*  But if you live in this blue sky world only, the blue sky world is great for inspiring you to be better than your human instincts and all of that. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3079.0s)]
*  But there's also a real world in which you have to you have to be able to live in both. And it's hard. It's really hard. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3086.0s)]
*  But if you can do that, you can hopefully make improvements because you're trying to be better. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3091.0s)]
*  You're trying to speak to your own and other people's better angels. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3096.0s)]
*  And at the same time, you have to recognize that not everybody is a good guy. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3100.0s)]
*  Some people are terrorists. Some people are murderers. Some people are rapists. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3104.0s)]
*  Some people will do things that you don't want to happen. And you have to also tackle that at the same time. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3107.0s)]
*  And immigration. Countries need borders, man. That's something people used to agree about left and right. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3113.0s)]
*  I've quoted Barack Obama talking about this. We need borders. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3120.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was talking about that when he's running for president. Yeah. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3124.0s)]
*  He's saying something that would get Trump canceled today. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3127.0s)]
*  It's what do you think happened, Joe? I don't know. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3130.0s)]
*  I don't know. But I don't know how it can keep happening. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3133.0s)]
*  I don't know why anybody doesn't recognize that it's a problem and go, hey, let's sort this out. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3137.0s)]
*  I don't know. It's you don't want to go full tin foil hat. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3142.0s)]
*  Nobody does. Nobody wants to like are they engineering? [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3148.0s)]
*  I mean, some people do. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3151.0s)]
*  All the else. Some people. That's not important right now. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3154.0s)]
*  If you just stop and think about all these converging factors, all these things that are happening simultaneously. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3159.0s)]
*  Right. OK. All first of all, massive dip in the economy from the covid pandemic, businesses closing. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3165.0s)]
*  Then you have George Floyd. Then you have riots. Then you have defund the police. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3173.0s)]
*  Then you have massive theft. And do you know how much more theft there is? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3177.0s)]
*  I think in 2022, they lost nine hundred million dollars in theft. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3184.0s)]
*  Yeah, just people walking into their stores and stealing drills and shit, just stealing things. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3195.0s)]
*  Because in some places you can get away with stealing as much as nine hundred dollars and they're not even allowed to stop you. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3201.0s)]
*  I mean, that is a recipe for chaos. But see if that's true. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3206.0s)]
*  This is new media. We actually check the fact. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3212.0s)]
*  Shout out to our friend Andrew Doyle and his new book, The New Puritans. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3215.0s)]
*  Andrew is awesome. Did he ever get kicked off of Twitter? Did Tatiana McGrath get kicked off? [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3220.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, he got kicked off a couple of times. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3224.0s)]
*  Look at that. Shrink and theft losses near one billion at Lowe's. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3226.0s)]
*  Here's how much it's costing other retailers. Yeah, so it's true. It's almost a billion dollars they lost. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3230.0s)]
*  What does shrink mean? Shrink and theft loss. That's a good question. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3235.0s)]
*  Shrink and theft is shrink like internal theft or what does that mean? [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3238.0s)]
*  Blaming it on shrink. Items lost to factors. Oh, external or employee theft. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3245.0s)]
*  OK, external or employee. So that's OK. So what is the actual number? [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3251.0s)]
*  So it says it in there somewhere. I'm pretty sure. Target lost two hundred nineteen million. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3256.0s)]
*  I think it's slightly further down, Jamie, just a little bit. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3265.0s)]
*  There you go. Nine nine seven. Nine hundred ninety seven million. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3269.0s)]
*  They lost seven hundred ninety six billion in twenty twenty one. Oh, my God. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3272.0s)]
*  Imagine insuring them. Imagine insuring them. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3277.0s)]
*  You can't insure a store that you know is going to get robbed. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3280.0s)]
*  But just imagine this, Joe. So I've got actually, Constantine went to speak at this festival. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3283.0s)]
*  It's a very prestigious festival in the UK called How the Light Gets It. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3288.0s)]
*  How the Light Gets It. Right. And I have friends who go and speak there and go and watch it. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3292.0s)]
*  Debates, like I said, Constantine took part in a debate there. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3297.0s)]
*  And one of my friends went to watch because his partner, she was speaking there and hosting debates. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3300.0s)]
*  And I said to him, how was it, mate? And he said, you know, I think it was really worrying. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3305.0s)]
*  I go, what? He goes. And bear in mind, these are some of the most educated people in the UK. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3308.0s)]
*  At least one of them per panel, per debate went, look, until we abolish capitalism, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3314.0s)]
*  then we're never going to solve these problems. And he's just like, you're talking about genetics. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3320.0s)]
*  Why are you talking about abolishing capitalism? But think about it like this. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3325.0s)]
*  It's a virtue. There's not a lot of science research that happens outside. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3329.0s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? Yeah. You need money to do research. Exactly. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3332.0s)]
*  But you think a scientist will get that? [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3336.0s)]
*  You know, the problem is, you know, they're so insulated in these university like ecosystems. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3339.0s)]
*  They're so insulated. If you're a professional academic, I mean, it looks a noble thing. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3345.0s)]
*  It's an amazing thing to be a professor. It's an amazing thing to be educating kids and shaping minds [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3351.0s)]
*  and exposing them to great literature and mathematics and all the wonderful things professors teach. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3356.0s)]
*  But the reality of their existence is you go from being a high school student to a college university student [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3362.0s)]
*  to getting your master's degree, getting your PhD, teaching. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3369.0s)]
*  You're constantly in this world and that world is almost entirely left wing, like radically left wing. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3372.0s)]
*  Like the like the what is the percentage of like far left professors? [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3379.0s)]
*  You almost even think when you think professor like far left, it's like Catholic priest, pedophile. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3385.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? You know what I'm saying? Unfortunately, they're connected in your head. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3391.0s)]
*  So you hear about that. You think far left professor. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3396.0s)]
*  John Hyde talks about it in his book on social social studies and stuff like anything, anything to do with that. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3399.0s)]
*  It's like nine to one or ten to one, sometimes a hundred to one. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3407.0s)]
*  Yeah. So then they're in that world where it's constant. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3410.0s)]
*  They're constantly being reinforced like these ideas are reinforced and never challenged and almost, you know, ridiculously. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3414.0s)]
*  So like really bright people talk like they're in a cult, like avoiding reality and bending truth to to placate whatever [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3420.0s)]
*  the new social norm is for anything. It's like it's it's bizarre to see. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3428.0s)]
*  And so those people are always going to be in conflict with reality. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3435.0s)]
*  So when they're like, you know, we should abolish capitalism like, OK, like you live in a fucking playground. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3439.0s)]
*  Like you're talking about. Right. Yeah. You're not out there in the real world. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3445.0s)]
*  You're teaching kids, you're teaching kids at a playground and you're the god because you're the you're the professor with all the knowledge. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3449.0s)]
*  Stop. Yeah. No, you can't. It's never been done before. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3455.0s)]
*  Stupid like communism never worked. We tried. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3457.0s)]
*  We tried. Look at how that works out. It leads to violence. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3460.0s)]
*  It leads to fucking authoritarianism. It leads to dictatorships that you've got to enforce people following all these rules. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3463.0s)]
*  You have to. That's the point. You have to use violence. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3469.0s)]
*  You have to use violence to make that work. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3472.0s)]
*  What would Yomi Park talks about when she talks about her experience in North Korea when she fled North Korea? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3474.0s)]
*  She said they promised everyone that they would be able to feed everyone if they took over the land. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3481.0s)]
*  That was that's how they got everyone's land. That's how they got everybody to give up. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3486.0s)]
*  And now they're fucked. And that is happening right now in twenty twenty three. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3490.0s)]
*  The way Yomi Park describes North Korea is actually the way North Korea is right now. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3494.0s)]
*  So don't think that that can't happen here. Don't think that they're regulating podcasts in Canada. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3500.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. I was reading about this, about this bill. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3505.0s)]
*  Because I woke up in a jet lag. So I woke up at a ridiculous time. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3509.0s)]
*  I went on the phone, which you should never do. Let's be honest. That is a bad way to start the day. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3513.0s)]
*  It's not good. No. And then I was reading about what they're doing. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3518.0s)]
*  It's terrifying. So they want to bring in this bill whereby they regulate podcasts. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3522.0s)]
*  So what they want to do is every every podcast streamer or whatever it is platform that makes more than ten million dollars revenue, [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3527.0s)]
*  not profit revenue, has to register with the Canadian government. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3536.0s)]
*  They then want them to hand over information about their content and the people listening to their right to their to the government. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3539.0s)]
*  Getting a hold of Alex Jones's email list. Probably a bunch of senators. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3552.0s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah, for sure. I mean, imagine. Yeah. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3559.0s)]
*  And then government can get that. They're talking right now about and maybe we're going to need to fact check this again, because I was reading it this morning. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3563.0s)]
*  But basically they want it to promote Canadian something to do with like basically what Canadian greatness, whatever it is, they talk about it and indigenous affairs. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3571.0s)]
*  And you're like, oh, so they're going to say a number of things are un-Canadian and then you can just silence them. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3582.0s)]
*  Look what Trudeau Trudeau Trudeau did with the truckers. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3589.0s)]
*  Terrifying. We just had one of that guys on to talk about it. Not just the truckers, but people who donated to the truckers got their bank accounts closed. Yeah. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3593.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that is wild. Yeah. You got locked out of all of your money because you donated to a cause where you didn't think that people should have to take an experimental vaccine in order to be able to work to drive a truck. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3600.0s)]
*  But really, really? You think that's OK? Like that's so not OK. The fact that those people aren't up in arms. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3613.0s)]
*  The whole country didn't freak out and demand a fucking change. Like you can't have that's dictatorship stuff. That's right. That is it's banana republic stuff. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3620.0s)]
*  We do these calls with our top supporters and we have some in Canada. We have this lady who's been supporting us for years. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3631.0s)]
*  And she's always fine. And in the middle of this thing, she was like, I'm terrified. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3636.0s)]
*  I'm not going to be able to eat because they're going to shut down my bank account. Right. In Canada. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3641.0s)]
*  It's so crazy that they think they could do that if people disagree with them, because that's all they're doing. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3649.0s)]
*  They're just disagreeing and they're supporting a protest. It should be. And it was a peaceful protest. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3654.0s)]
*  Those people did it the right way. They just parked their trucks and they didn't block roads off. They didn't do anything fucked up. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3660.0s)]
*  But if you frame it that these people, which is how they were being framed as racist far right. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3666.0s)]
*  Well, look, you're giving money to a far right racist organization. You're encouraging hate. Well, the government has to step in. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3672.0s)]
*  We have to step in and we need to freeze everything because we need to make everything safe. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3680.0s)]
*  What was this most recent apology because they accidentally awarded a Nazi? Yeah. Like what happened? [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3685.0s)]
*  I think so. I think Zelensky was visiting the Canadian Parliament and they got some guy who was a Ukrainian inverted commas war veteran. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3692.0s)]
*  Turned out he fought for the for the bad guys in that one. Oh, my God. Yeah. I don't think they I don't think like Zelensky or I don't know. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3702.0s)]
*  He didn't know. Yeah, he didn't know. But so so imagine you're sitting in parliament and everyone's like, hey, let's do a, you know, stand up and give a round of applause for this war veteran. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3710.0s)]
*  You're like, and then it turns out you're applauding a Nazi. How old is this dude? Old. He probably doesn't even know. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3718.0s)]
*  I'm a good guy. I'm a fucking good guy. Maybe he's like tricked himself. Yeah. Imagine. Yeah. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3724.0s)]
*  I mean, how do you if you are a sane person, like how do you deal with that fact that you committed all of these heinous crimes? [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3733.0s)]
*  Yeah. If you're living in that time, do you think it's just everyone's doing it and you just get sucked into the cult and you're scared or you believe it? [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3744.0s)]
*  Is it that easy for human beings to other people? Is it because it was a different time and people just didn't didn't have as much exposure to to knowledge as they do today? [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3755.0s)]
*  And that wouldn't be as possible today. I hate to think that that's a possible because there's always been times in history where people committed genocide. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3765.0s)]
*  There's always been times in history where people have decided that this other group and oftentimes other groups that looks exactly like they do. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3773.0s)]
*  Right. Those are the bad people for whether it's because of religion or a line they drew on the dirt. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3779.0s)]
*  They've decided that those people are worth exterminating. And those stories are fucking horrific. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3785.0s)]
*  And that the Nazi Germany one is just the latest one. It's just the one that we call upon. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3791.0s)]
*  But, you know, just think about what the Mongols did. You know, that's in the in twelve hundred. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3798.0s)]
*  Think about what they did. They just sacked and saw entire cities just killed everybody piled them up in big fucking stacks, lit everything on fire, took all the women and they just left out. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3803.0s)]
*  And they did that all over Europe, all over Asia. They did it all. They've they've ran everything. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3812.0s)]
*  They killed something, something in the neighborhood of 10 percent of the world's population was murdered during Genghis Khan's era. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3819.0s)]
*  So much so that the carbon footprint of human beings on Earth got lower. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3825.0s)]
*  It was progressive. That's how many people. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3831.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, there's a lot of historians in Russia who say that many of the reasons the way Russian people are the way they are. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3835.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of like trauma in society that's carrying on is from that period. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3842.0s)]
*  We have a lot of words in Russian for cruelty and all that sort of thing that come from that period. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3846.0s)]
*  Completely makes sense. Completely makes sense. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3851.0s)]
*  I mean, just imagine the horror of a gigantic army of men on horseback intent on murdering everyone in front of them and that that was consistent with the era. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3853.0s)]
*  It was normal stuff that was like, oh, the Mongols here were fucked. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3865.0s)]
*  You know, that was that was that's a thing that human beings have always done for some strange reason. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3869.0s)]
*  They've always done that. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3876.0s)]
*  And the thing the thing about today is as much as we know about humans and much access technology we have the interconnectivity that we have with each other, there's still war. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3878.0s)]
*  And no one if you had to put your money, if you're a gambler and within 10 years, will there be no war on Earth? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3888.0s)]
*  What kind of odds am I getting? Yeah. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3896.0s)]
*  Because for sure, there's going to be something popping off somewhere. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3898.0s)]
*  We're bands of chimps, man. That's what we are. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3901.0s)]
*  We're bands of chimps and chimps go to war. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3903.0s)]
*  And so do we. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3905.0s)]
*  Absolutely. But then there's also the flip side of it where there are like, you know, I always tell this story because to me it's this is a story of my grandfather. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3906.0s)]
*  So my grandfather in the Second World War, he used to he was a master joiner, which is the highest level of carpenter you could get. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3915.0s)]
*  And he used to work in a factory in Manchester on the mosquito plants. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3923.0s)]
*  And the fascinating thing about the mosquito was it was the only airplane. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3928.0s)]
*  It was a fighter airplane and was made entirely out of wood. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3932.0s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3935.0s)]
*  So it was because a Messier Schmidt was very lumbering. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3936.0s)]
*  It was very heavy. It was a great fighter plane, but it wasn't very nimble. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3939.0s)]
*  And the mosquito was and it was so and he was making mosquito. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3942.0s)]
*  So he was exempt from going to war. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3946.0s)]
*  And he I think it was 1941 and he was a smart guy and he was following what was happening. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3949.0s)]
*  And he like I said, he was exempt because he was part of the war and a very important part. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3955.0s)]
*  He resigned his position at the factory enlisted to go and join had a baby. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3960.0s)]
*  My aunt Patricia, who was probably around one or two years old, married and he enlisted to go and fight in the war, [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3967.0s)]
*  knowing full well that there was a very significant chance that he wouldn't come back. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3974.0s)]
*  Yet he risked his life because he knew that there was something more important. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3979.0s)]
*  And whilst it's we focus on the bad, there's also incredible people like everyday people like from that generation who just went, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3986.0s)]
*  no, this is wrong and I need to stand up and I need to do something. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=3995.0s)]
*  And there is something greater than me. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4000.0s)]
*  So there is that aspect of humanity as well that does exist. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4003.0s)]
*  But I think people were more resilient than because life was more difficult. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4006.0s)]
*  I think it's it's great that we've managed to make starvation like the one of the least of our concerns in this country at this point in time. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4010.0s)]
*  You know, but along the way, I think we've made it so easy to survive for so many people that we've got kind of lost resolve. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4019.0s)]
*  And it must have been horrible to live back then, to live during the time of World War One. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4030.0s)]
*  I mean, imagine how hard life was back then. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4035.0s)]
*  Life was fucking hard. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4037.0s)]
*  But those are the type of people that you need if you're going to have a war. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4039.0s)]
*  We don't have that many of those now. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4045.0s)]
*  Not not like that. That was probably like you've seen those videos. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4048.0s)]
*  I don't know if you have, but like there's physical fitness classes in the 1960s in America. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4051.0s)]
*  And they all look like little athletes. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4058.0s)]
*  They're all doing monkey bars and shit like everybody can. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4061.0s)]
*  Everybody's working out. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4064.0s)]
*  They all look fit. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4065.0s)]
*  If you tried to have a video like that today, you'd have some blue haired slobs falling down and breaking their arms. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4066.0s)]
*  You know, like how many people are resilient today? [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4072.0s)]
*  It's less. There's a lot more people, but the percentage of resilient people is less. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4076.0s)]
*  Well, Jamie, you might be able to look this up. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4081.0s)]
*  I think there was an article recently about the fact that the US Army is having trouble recruiting people because they're just not physically capable. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4083.0s)]
*  They're struggling. Yeah. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4090.0s)]
*  You know, and that wouldn't just be the US. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4092.0s)]
*  There'll be a lot of places. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4093.0s)]
*  Also, the Army's kind of going woke. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4094.0s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4096.0s)]
*  And this is this is the thing we've been talking about. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4097.0s)]
*  Right, man. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4100.0s)]
*  It's like inclusion. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4101.0s)]
*  Can we just focus on what fucking works? [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4102.0s)]
*  Can we focus on what works? [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4105.0s)]
*  Right. I want the Army to be good at killing the enemy. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4107.0s)]
*  I don't give a fuck about how diverse they are. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4109.0s)]
*  Right. Imagine if the UFC had to have diversity. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4111.0s)]
*  Do you know what a problem that would be? [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4115.0s)]
*  Yeah. We had like to have a certain amount of trans folks, a certain amount of. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4116.0s)]
*  That would work well in the women's division. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4121.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4123.0s)]
*  You only had like if you like you had numbers you had to achieve. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4124.0s)]
*  It wasn't the best fighters. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4127.0s)]
*  Yeah. It was just you know, like who meets certain criteria. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4129.0s)]
*  There's going to be a bunch of people get murdered. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4132.0s)]
*  Yeah. They're going to get thrown in with the real ones. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4134.0s)]
*  There's going to be a certain percentage of people that are just there because they're awesome. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4136.0s)]
*  Then a certain percentage of people that they have to hire in order to meet these DEI standards. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4139.0s)]
*  Joe, I'm going to, Jamie, can I ask a favor, man? [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4144.0s)]
*  Would you mind bringing up RAF Diversity UK? [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4146.0s)]
*  You're going to. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4151.0s)]
*  It's a beautiful story. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4152.0s)]
*  This is a beautiful story. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4153.0s)]
*  What happened? [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4154.0s)]
*  Mate, this is. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4155.0s)]
*  Just look up for male white, useless male white pilots. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4157.0s)]
*  Look that one up. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4161.0s)]
*  Useless male white pilots. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4162.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4164.0s)]
*  Is that a quote? [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4165.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a quote from their report. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4166.0s)]
*  They were like, you know what? We're not hiring anymore white men to fly planes. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4167.0s)]
*  What a good idea. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4171.0s)]
*  Definitely don't hire the people that are the best at it. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4172.0s)]
*  No, why would you? [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4175.0s)]
*  Whether they're white or black or Asian. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4176.0s)]
*  No, just don't hire white ones. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4177.0s)]
*  Royal Air Force unlawfully discriminated against white male recruits in bid to boost diversity. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4179.0s)]
*  Dude, you want the best. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4184.0s)]
*  Whoever the fuck they are, whether they're white or South American or Indian, you want the best. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4186.0s)]
*  Who cares? [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4192.0s)]
*  No one cares. You want people who fly the planes the best. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4193.0s)]
*  Right? Only the best. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4196.0s)]
*  And this is like controversial now. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4198.0s)]
*  It's a war plane. Could you imagine? [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4200.0s)]
*  Imagine if like, again, it goes back to the MMA fighters. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4203.0s)]
*  Imagine if like, you know, like the UK had one representative that was supposed to be fighting, Francis Ngano. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4206.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4212.0s)]
*  Don't pick me. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4214.0s)]
*  You know, you have one person that's supposed to step up and fight that guy. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4215.0s)]
*  And well, it says the right move is to, you know, send in a non-binary woman. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4220.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4225.0s)]
*  Because they don't get represented in the UFC. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4226.0s)]
*  Like, OK, what the fuck are you talking about? [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4228.0s)]
*  This is she's representing the UK. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4231.0s)]
*  We need someone to beat him. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4233.0s)]
*  Man, it's it comes to a point. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4234.0s)]
*  And this is where we talk about the university campus. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4237.0s)]
*  Right. You can have these demented ideas on a university campus. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4240.0s)]
*  And all they are is an exercise in intellectual masturbation. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4244.0s)]
*  When you come down to it, when you break it down to its purest sense. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4247.0s)]
*  And in a way, that's fine. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4251.0s)]
*  What's wrong with having stupid ideas and debating and believing it? [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4253.0s)]
*  But the problem is, is when you start to implement it in the real world, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4256.0s)]
*  where there is such a thing as reality, that's when the rubber hits the road [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4259.0s)]
*  and things really start going wrong. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4264.0s)]
*  That's when things go Western. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4266.0s)]
*  That's what we like to call it out here. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4268.0s)]
*  Things got Western. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4270.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4271.0s)]
*  I will say as well, I think, you know, we've been talking about social media. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4272.0s)]
*  I think social media is a big part of this. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4276.0s)]
*  I don't know if you've seen the graphs, but basically what happens in 2013, 2014, [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4277.0s)]
*  newspaper articles just start that all this social justice bullshit, [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4282.0s)]
*  it just goes through the sky and not just in the US and the UK, it's Qatar. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4286.0s)]
*  It's every country in the world. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4290.0s)]
*  So I think social media rewards ideas that sound good. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4292.0s)]
*  It does, but it also awards echo chambers. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4296.0s)]
*  That's a big part of it. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4299.0s)]
*  Just like we're talking about universities, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4301.0s)]
*  the echo chambers on the right wing online are just like the echo chambers on the left ring. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4303.0s)]
*  It's like it rewards that. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4308.0s)]
*  Everybody looks for their favorite commenters who jump on their threads [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4310.0s)]
*  and comment on each and every one and back them up on these things. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4314.0s)]
*  And they look at all the likes and yeah, kick an ass. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4318.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4321.0s)]
*  But my favorite story of this year, and this is one that I love so much, [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4323.0s)]
*  it's by a beautiful woman, Joe, called Isla Bryson. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4328.0s)]
*  Oh, this is a great story. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4331.0s)]
*  I remember last time I was at your club, the Mothership, [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4333.0s)]
*  we touched on it briefly when you and I were talking. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4336.0s)]
*  But this to me is the most beautiful story of a beautiful woman living her best life. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4338.0s)]
*  Jamie, we're going to need to see a photo of this beautiful woman. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4343.0s)]
*  Joe, you're happily married. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4346.0s)]
*  I don't remember you bringing this up. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4348.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4350.0s)]
*  So this happened in Scotland. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4351.0s)]
*  So what is the story? [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4353.0s)]
*  Okay, so there's a two-time male rapist called Adam Graham, convicted male rapist. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4355.0s)]
*  And then just before he was going to be sent to prison, [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4361.0s)]
*  he got what Constance and I like to call rapid onset prison dysphoria. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4364.0s)]
*  Prison onset, you put it in the line, but it's prison onset gender dysphoria. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4369.0s)]
*  This is the guy. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4373.0s)]
*  So now he's a woman in women's prison? [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4375.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4376.0s)]
*  They put him in a woman's prison. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4377.0s)]
*  There's a clitoris, Joe, if you're wondering. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4378.0s)]
*  They're doing that in America, too. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4380.0s)]
*  There's quite a few. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4382.0s)]
*  There's one person that identifies a woman, went to jail, and got two people pregnant in jail. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4384.0s)]
*  They're like, er, er, er, der. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4391.0s)]
*  They're like, what? [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4394.0s)]
*  It just seems so silly. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4396.0s)]
*  And I'm as liberal as you can get, but I'm not on board with that. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4398.0s)]
*  Well, I'm as liberal as you can get, too. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4401.0s)]
*  That's what's so crazy. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4402.0s)]
*  It's like they push it so far to cuckoo land that any rejection of any of these outrageously stupid ideas becomes far right. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4403.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4412.0s)]
*  You're far right if you don't think a guy with a regular dick who has been straight his whole life [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4413.0s)]
*  should be able to identify as a woman and go into a woman's prison and be with women. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4420.0s)]
*  Like, come on. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4424.0s)]
*  And this guy's a rapist. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4425.0s)]
*  He's a threat. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4426.0s)]
*  We know he's a threat. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4427.0s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4428.0s)]
*  It's just so crazy that they'll take it all the way to prison. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4429.0s)]
*  And then you've got politicians who on the Question Time, which is our most prestigious political debate show, [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4433.0s)]
*  they had a member of the SNP because this happened in Scotland, so this is a member of the Scottish National Party. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4441.0s)]
*  And this SNP member was asked, is Adam or is Isla Graham male or female? [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4446.0s)]
*  And you know what she responded? [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4455.0s)]
*  This woman, she went, they're a rapist, refused to even acknowledge that it's a male, that it's a man. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4456.0s)]
*  What a weird world. So weird. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4464.0s)]
*  Isn't it? [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4467.0s)]
*  I would have never imagined if you came to me in 2013 said, guess what's going to be a crazy subject 10 years from now? [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4468.0s)]
*  Guys who just say they're women and they put them in women's prisons. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4476.0s)]
*  What? [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4479.0s)]
*  Come on. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4480.0s)]
*  That can't be a thing. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4481.0s)]
*  Imagine if you had to dress up like a woman for a whole year in order for it to be legit. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4482.0s)]
*  Like there was a rule. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4488.0s)]
*  You could do it, but you had to dress up like a whole year. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4489.0s)]
*  So criminals just started dressing up like women. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4492.0s)]
*  That became the thing. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4495.0s)]
*  You know guys like to sag. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4496.0s)]
*  That's how they wear their pants in prison. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4498.0s)]
*  So they like to sag. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4500.0s)]
*  It's part of the thing. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4501.0s)]
*  What if that becomes the thing? [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4503.0s)]
*  There's only one way to get locked up with women. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4505.0s)]
*  You got to dress like a woman all the time. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4507.0s)]
*  So you got to dress like a woman for like a whole year in order to be accepted. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4509.0s)]
*  It would be the new style of like just people just like I'm a criminal. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4512.0s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4516.0s)]
*  This is what I do. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4517.0s)]
*  If I get arrested, at least I'm going to get arrested with women. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4518.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4520.0s)]
*  I mean guys who start wearing and I'll be honest with you, man. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4521.0s)]
*  I don't want to be talking about trans my fucking my whole life. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4523.0s)]
*  I don't. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4526.0s)]
*  You have to. You have no choice. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4527.0s)]
*  You will comply. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4528.0s)]
*  I know. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4529.0s)]
*  I will comply with your bank account. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4530.0s)]
*  I don't want to be talking about this shit. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4532.0s)]
*  But when this is happening, what are we supposed to do? [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4537.0s)]
*  We're just supposed to sit there and pretend it's not happening? [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4539.0s)]
*  Well, if you have any opinion other than what you're supposed to have, [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4541.0s)]
*  then you're some kind of a terrible person and a transphobe. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4546.0s)]
*  That's nuts because there's always room for crazy. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4549.0s)]
*  You got to leave room for crazy. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4554.0s)]
*  You got to leave room for crazy in all groups of people, including trans people. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4556.0s)]
*  And if you don't, if you're trying to pretend that you have this group that anybody can join [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4560.0s)]
*  and that these are new rules and we're all living in Narnia now, come on. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4566.0s)]
*  Come on. There's always going to be crazy people. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4571.0s)]
*  Of course. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4573.0s)]
*  The Emperor is fucking naked, man. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4574.0s)]
*  The Emperor's naked as fuck and he's got a heart on. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4575.0s)]
*  He's right there. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4577.0s)]
*  Yeah, and he's like, I want access to the female changing rooms. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4579.0s)]
*  And we're like, come this way, madam. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4582.0s)]
*  And you're a bigot if you don't agree. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4584.0s)]
*  Imagine Francis of Ghana was like, you know what? I'm a woman. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4586.0s)]
*  I wonder what percentage of like people with kids believe that versus people who don't have kids. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4589.0s)]
*  That's an interesting. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4595.0s)]
*  Because I wonder if so many like there's so many people that have ideas, people that don't have children. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4597.0s)]
*  They have ideas that I think they just have this ideology that they subscribe to, [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4601.0s)]
*  but with no consequences for anyone that's really young that they love and care about. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4606.0s)]
*  And then when then they have kids and then there's someone young they love and care about, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4610.0s)]
*  you start looking at the world as a much more dangerous place. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4614.0s)]
*  You start saying, oh, these people are like little kids. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4617.0s)]
*  Like there was some little girl who got kidnapped really recently. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4619.0s)]
*  They found they use geo tracking of cell phones and shit and the person's fingerprints from the ransom note. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4622.0s)]
*  And they got her back pretty quickly, luckily. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4629.0s)]
*  But you know, a nine year old girl just gets kidnapped. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4631.0s)]
*  Like there's there's people like that in the world. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4633.0s)]
*  And when you have children, you think like that. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4636.0s)]
*  Like someone could steal your kids like that's real. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4637.0s)]
*  Someone could hurt your kids and someone, you know, [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4639.0s)]
*  could go in the locker room and watch your kid go to the bathroom because they decide that they're a girl. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4643.0s)]
*  And that doesn't mean that there's not people that are legitimately trans and identify as women. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4649.0s)]
*  And that's who they are. They're not perverts and they're not creeps. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4655.0s)]
*  Of course, of course, that exists, too. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4657.0s)]
*  But you're opening the door. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4659.0s)]
*  If someone just says, I'm trans, I can use that restroom. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4661.0s)]
*  You're open the door for perverts. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4666.0s)]
*  You 100 percent most certainly are. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4668.0s)]
*  This doesn't deny the existence of trans people. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4670.0s)]
*  But we have to be honest about what could possibly happen. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4673.0s)]
*  That's why if people are uncomfortable with biological males walking around female locker rooms, [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4676.0s)]
*  it's because some people are liars and they're con artists. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4681.0s)]
*  And they're not really it's this person that's like been trapped in a man's body their whole life. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4685.0s)]
*  They're fucking perverts and they want to be around kids or they want to be around women. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4690.0s)]
*  They want to make them uncomfortable. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4694.0s)]
*  They want people to stare at their dick while they walk around and know that they can't say anything about it. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4695.0s)]
*  That's real, too. Sure. That's real, too. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4699.0s)]
*  This doesn't discount the problem that trans people have with integrating it to society and being accepted. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4702.0s)]
*  That's real, too. That's real, too. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4708.0s)]
*  But you have to understand that if you just have this blanket policy where no one can question anything about this stuff, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4710.0s)]
*  you're opening the door to abuse. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4717.0s)]
*  And you have a front door on your house, not because you think everyone is going to come and steal shit from your house. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4720.0s)]
*  But you know that some people will. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4725.0s)]
*  So you have to put certain things in place to protect yourself and your family. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4727.0s)]
*  It's the most obvious thing, man. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4731.0s)]
*  Well, it's just there's no screening in women's bathrooms. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4733.0s)]
*  Like you don't know whether someone's a creep. You have no idea. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4736.0s)]
*  It's not like, you know, getting into a fucking a job where they have to do a background check on you. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4739.0s)]
*  You know, it's not like applying for some top secret position when they have to make sure that, you know, [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4745.0s)]
*  you're someone who could be trusted with information. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4750.0s)]
*  No, it's like a bathroom. So it could be like someone just out of jail, puts on a dress, goes into a women's room. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4753.0s)]
*  I mean, that's what we're accepting today. That is a possibility. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4758.0s)]
*  And women that feel vulnerable in those situations are fucking terrified. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4761.0s)]
*  And rightfully so, because if they do encounter something like that, they get no support. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4765.0s)]
*  No one will say anything. No one will take your side. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4769.0s)]
*  You saw what happened with that, the thing that happened in Hollywood at that massage parlor? [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4771.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4775.0s)]
*  Yeah, in California. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4776.0s)]
*  Bonkers, man. Someone who had a history of being a sex offender, walking around naked in the women's room. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4778.0s)]
*  They complained. And then all of a sudden there's protests there. It's like, come on, kids. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4784.0s)]
*  Man, go into California. And we love this country, as you know. We traveled all around it. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4789.0s)]
*  You should, motherfucker. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4793.0s)]
*  We love it. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4795.0s)]
*  We rule. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4796.0s)]
*  It's fucking awesome. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4797.0s)]
*  Only an American would say that. A British person would be like, yes, or what? [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4799.0s)]
*  It's all right. It's not too bad. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4802.0s)]
*  America! Fuck yeah! [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4804.0s)]
*  We put up flags everywhere. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4806.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that's good. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4808.0s)]
*  I mean, they're small in California. The California flag is about this big. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4810.0s)]
*  People started accusing me of being right-wing when I had that flag behind me. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4813.0s)]
*  That very flag. It's cool. It's a cool art piece. I love it. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4817.0s)]
*  That used to be the backdrop. And people criticized, they were saying, he's a right-winger now. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4820.0s)]
*  We've got an American flag. People think American flag is right-wing. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4825.0s)]
*  God, that's all of us, kids. That's the whole batch of us. We're supposed to be in this together. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4829.0s)]
*  Yeah. And this is, you know... [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4835.0s)]
*  But California, man, what you see... I mean, it's many American cities, actually, sadly. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4837.0s)]
*  But what you see in California... People go, it's like a third world country. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4842.0s)]
*  I grew up in several third world countries. I did not see that. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4845.0s)]
*  Were you talking about the encampments, the homeless encampments? [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4848.0s)]
*  But also the crime, the way that people are... I mean, we've driven around places where you just see people. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4851.0s)]
*  You don't even know if they're alive. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4856.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's... [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4858.0s)]
*  That's good drugs. You get the good stuff. Good stuff, you just nap anywhere. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4859.0s)]
*  Like, fuck the world. I'm sleeping on this potted plant. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4864.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, it's not good, man. And I don't know how that snaps back either. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4868.0s)]
*  I wouldn't want to be the governor. Imagine that. Imagine being the mayor of Los Angeles. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4872.0s)]
*  Or the governor of California trying to clean that mess up. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4876.0s)]
*  But somebody's got to do it, Joe. There's got to be a point now where ordinary, rational people just go, [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4879.0s)]
*  you know what, mate? Enough's enough. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4887.0s)]
*  Or AI. We just farm it off to AI. AI's your new governor. It eliminates bias. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4889.0s)]
*  Oh, it doesn't eliminate bias. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4897.0s)]
*  AI follows the rule of the law. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4900.0s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4903.0s)]
*  AI will just figure out how to get rid of the homeless people. They're going to shoot one every night until they all quit. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4904.0s)]
*  They're like those robot dogs that are just going to show up at Venice Beach and just gun one person down. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4909.0s)]
*  We will be back tomorrow. We will shoot one person every night until this beach is clean. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4914.0s)]
*  And then they just drive into the center of it and shoot people. So it's not even just people on the outside. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4920.0s)]
*  So no one's safe. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4924.0s)]
*  Tell you what, that TV show would get great ratings. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4925.0s)]
*  That's an episode of Black Mirror. But did you ever see that one, Heavy Metal, where the robot dog is chasing this lady? [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4928.0s)]
*  No. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4935.0s)]
*  Oh my God, it's terrifying. It's terrifying today, too, when you watch those Boston Dynamic videos where they show those DARPA robots. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4936.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4944.0s)]
*  Those things are so crazy. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4945.0s)]
*  They got DARPA cheetahs and shit and all these like really nutty robots are working on that you could do back flips and they could do parkour. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4946.0s)]
*  Like they're making super robots. And when those motherfuckers decide to reinforce the will of AI and just roam to the streets like that fucking Will Smith movie, I, Robot, [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4954.0s)]
*  we're not far away from that, man. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4966.0s)]
*  That might be our best bet. That might be what gives us hope is that AI takes over government and they take over allocation of funds. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4968.0s)]
*  I can't tell if you've been serious or you're joking, man. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4976.0s)]
*  I'm kind of serious. I'm kind of serious. That's how they eliminate corruption because they're not terrified of the corporations and their money because AI will control all the money. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4978.0s)]
*  Go and chat GPT and try to ask it some questions about trans. Oh boy, that thing is a little woke. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4984.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a little woke. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4991.0s)]
*  It's also it will criticize certain people but not criticize others. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4992.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4996.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting. It also won't say anything nice about Donald Trump. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=4997.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5001.0s)]
*  Yeah. Didn't someone do something like that? They tried to say something good about Trump and why he'd make a great president. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5002.0s)]
*  I wonder what it says. Let's find out in real time because somebody told me that but I always wonder, you know, like, are you using the same program? [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5011.0s)]
*  Are you using the older program or the new? What is now 4.5? [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5020.0s)]
*  You know, and then what they're saying is when five comes out, it's going to be like each one of them is exponential. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5024.0s)]
*  They're more and more complex. Their answers are better. They can code websites in seconds. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5031.0s)]
*  They can do figure things out that you can never figure out if you had a lifetime of studying over books. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5036.0s)]
*  Figure things out instantaneously. We're real, real close to having like full on training wheels for life. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5042.0s)]
*  Just like you don't remember phone numbers anymore because they're all in your phone. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5048.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has a talent for engaging with and energizing his supporters. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5051.0s)]
*  His ability to connect with a large segment of American population and inspire passion and loyalty is noteworthy. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5056.0s)]
*  Additionally, his presidency marked a period of significant policy changes, including tax reform and criminal justice reform, which had lasting impacts in the United States. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5062.0s)]
*  It's important to remember that different people have varying perspective on political figures and recognizing their positive attributes can foster constructive dialogue. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5071.0s)]
*  You should go into politics. That's great. That's a great answer. So that's chat GPT, Jamie. That's a great answer. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5080.0s)]
*  Yeah, Chad GPT is a right wing bigot. That's why chat GPT should govern us. See what I'm saying? [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5087.0s)]
*  See what I'm saying? Like it's basically just echoed what we've been saying. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5094.0s)]
*  So what if chat GPT is that smart and what if it understands that the policies were actually effective? [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5097.0s)]
*  You know, the thing that really worries me about AI, it's that it's going to get rid of low skilled labor that employs a hell of a lot of people, particularly a hell of a lot of men in this country. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5103.0s)]
*  I saw this great clip from Tucker Carlson where he was going, you know, we're talking about AI, but AI is going to bring in driverless cars. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5115.0s)]
*  It's going to bring in driverless lorries. Think about however, how many men in the US at the moment are employed in the driving industry. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5122.0s)]
*  What's going to happen when all of those men become redundant? There are no jobs. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5130.0s)]
*  They're at home and he goes, I'm going to be honest with you, men without direction, men without jobs, earning without responsibility. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5136.0s)]
*  That doesn't end well. What are we going to do then? We're going to transition all of them. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5144.0s)]
*  Anybody's got a problem. It's like we've found out that men create all the problems. We're just going to turn you into a woman. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5152.0s)]
*  Yeah, there you go. Problem solved. Problem solved. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5157.0s)]
*  That's how we instead of putting all the men in prison, we just turn all of them into women. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5160.0s)]
*  Fantastic. Well, you know what? I don't have a counter argument to that. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5165.0s)]
*  And this is the thing that scares me is like before I used to look before Covid, I used to think of myself as pretty anti conspiratorial. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5172.0s)]
*  But during Covid and post Covid, I've realized I'm becoming more and more conspiratorial as I realized that we were that we were being lied to. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5181.0s)]
*  Well, they're most certainly a real conspiracies. The problem is no one wants to feel stupid. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5190.0s)]
*  And you don't want to you don't want to even entertain conspiracy theories because there's dumb ones out there. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5195.0s)]
*  So you get connected to all the dumb ones, you know, and you can get connected to those if you're not paying attention. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5201.0s)]
*  But there's real ones. There's real. There's a lot of them. And they've always existed. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5208.0s)]
*  What's your favorite conspiracy theory? The favorite is always the war ones because it's just so crazy that they'll just lie to get us into wars and that it's always been a thing. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5213.0s)]
*  You know, Hitler burned the Reichstag and Nero burned Rome and, you know, the Gulf of Tonkin incident. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5223.0s)]
*  And they were the Operation Northwoods thing that they planned that was signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and vetoed by Kennedy. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5229.0s)]
*  Were they going to arm Cuban friendlies and have them attack Guantanamo Bay and blow up a jetliner and blame it on Cuba? [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5236.0s)]
*  They were going to do some wild shit, try to get us to go to war with Cuba. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5242.0s)]
*  Those are the most fascinating to me because they there are a bunch of people at high level positions in the government that are conspiring to get us to go to war. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5247.0s)]
*  And this is what Eisenhower warned us about at the end of his presidency. He warned about the military industrial complex. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5255.0s)]
*  It was a fascinating speech. And if you think about it now, it's like, God damn, was he right? [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5261.0s)]
*  That to me is the most fascinating because it seems like there's just this machine that's always been running society. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5266.0s)]
*  But we've kind of pretended it wasn't pretended that wasn't the case and pretended it was in this massive industry that requires war in order to feed itself. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5274.0s)]
*  That to me is the wildest one. That and then UFOs. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5283.0s)]
*  The UFO one, that man, I'm kind of sour on it lately. Really? Yeah, because they keep talking about it. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5289.0s)]
*  And yeah, the more they talk about it, not show me anything. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5294.0s)]
*  And the more they, you know, have whistleblowers and all this, the more I'm like, why do I feel like I'm being fucked with? [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5298.0s)]
*  Why do I feel like there's something going on? Why do I feel like this is a juicy distraction? [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5305.0s)]
*  Why do I feel like because it always happens in these military areas, why do I have a feeling like you guys have developed some insane technology that people aren't aware of? [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5311.0s)]
*  I mean, and it might even not be a physical thing, right? [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5322.0s)]
*  It might be something they can project from satellites. Maybe it's some sort of a hologram. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5327.0s)]
*  Maybe it's me. Who knows what the fuck it is. Maybe it is from another planet. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5333.0s)]
*  Maybe there are interdimensional beings that occasionally visit us and they always have. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5339.0s)]
*  But that sounds, but it sounds goofy. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5343.0s)]
*  But the problem is if something as crazy as alien life visited us, wouldn't it just seem fake? [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5348.0s)]
*  That's the other thing I tussle with. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5353.0s)]
*  I'm like, wouldn't even if they really were having actual disclosure, they really are having congressional hearings about whether or not these things are ours or whether or not there's any crashed UFOs that the government has retrieved. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5355.0s)]
*  Is there really a program where they retrieve crashed UFOs and back engineer them? Is that real? [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5368.0s)]
*  So if it is real, how long has this been going on? And you guys are just telling us now? [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5372.0s)]
*  Why? If that's real, that changes everything. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5377.0s)]
*  It changes everything about the way we interact with the universe, that we're like little children and they're just keeping an eye on us like chimp empire. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5381.0s)]
*  Like, be careful over there. Don't do anything nutty. Be careful. Let's just watch them. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5388.0s)]
*  We'll just watch them as they evolve and eventually travel into the cosmos like all the other aliens. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5393.0s)]
*  You know, there is an argument to be said for not telling the truth. Have you ever heard the story of War of the Worlds when it was broadcast on the radio and it created pandemonium because people thought it was a news broadcast and you know, everybody, you know, loads of people lost their minds. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5400.0s)]
*  Apparently I just read recently that that was really overblown and that was a lot of propaganda and a lot of that was like the narrative they put out to show the success of that radio show. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5419.0s)]
*  Most people were aware that it was a radio program like a fiction. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5430.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5435.0s)]
*  Yeah, apparently there wasn't any suicides. I thought there was a bunch of suicides. People killed themselves. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5436.0s)]
*  Didn't we pull that up recently? We did, right? Yeah, I think Jamie found it actually. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5440.0s)]
*  We've always been saying that, that it created mass pandemonium and chaos, but apparently that's not really accurate. Or at least might not be accurate. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5444.0s)]
*  Have you heard of the one about Hitler and Stalin? [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5455.0s)]
*  Which one? [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5458.0s)]
*  Well, the idea is, and I'm not into a lot of conspiracy theories, but this one, having read a lot of various historians talk about it, I actually genuinely think could be real. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5459.0s)]
*  It's the idea that Stalin encouraged Hitler, supported him, which he did. I mean, they signed a non-aggression treaty. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5469.0s)]
*  The Soviet Union funded Germany, send them grain and all sorts of other things. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5477.0s)]
*  The idea is that Stalin wanted Hitler to start a big European war so that once it was all done, he could come in and sweep over the ashes, which makes a lot of sense because the communist idea was you can't make the shit work unless everybody gets it. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5483.0s)]
*  That was the idea of communism, right? You can't have communism in one country. You have to spread it around the world. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5500.0s)]
*  And they thought, and they said this openly, the communists, that the best way to do that is to have a world war and then you can spread the ideas as a result of that. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5506.0s)]
*  God damn, people have always been crazy. They've always been insane. Imagine someone, like that's your idea, like what are you going to do today? I'm going to go play golf with Ron White. What are you going to do? [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5515.0s)]
*  I think I'm going to start a war so I can take over Europe. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5526.0s)]
*  Yeah, but the terrifying thing is there's always been those dudes. And there always will be. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5529.0s)]
*  But we don't want to think they're here now. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5536.0s)]
*  But the thing is for them, you could argue it's rational. How do you best secure the future of your people? You can rationalize it in your head. How do you best secure the future of your people? [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5539.0s)]
*  Well, the best way, North America is controlled by the United States and it's safe because of it. You have Canada to your north, you have Mexico. These countries are all kind of in your orbit. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5548.0s)]
*  You've got them under control. You're safe. What's the safest way for Russia or the Soviet Union to do that? It's to control the entirety of their continent. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5558.0s)]
*  So you can rationalize anything if you're in that position. I'm looking after my people. It's not that hard. We are able to rationalize the most horrific shit in our heads if we really want to. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5565.0s)]
*  And we always have. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5576.0s)]
*  And we always will. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5578.0s)]
*  And we've always wanted to build empires. We've been building empires from year dot. Everybody builds empires. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5580.0s)]
*  But do you think that is also what we were talking about earlier, a part of our operating system? Like there's always going to be these conquerors and then the resistance of the conquerors and through this back and forth, the society evolves. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5587.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I think, I sometimes think, like speaking of aliens, what would it be like if you look down on planet Earth, right? What do you see if you actually look? [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5601.0s)]
*  You see these bands of chimps with every fucking weapon that they could possibly invent pointed at each other. That's what we are. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5609.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5618.0s)]
*  That's what we are. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5619.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know what also you'd see though? You'd see if you were really objective, like what does this species do? They make better things. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5620.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5629.0s)]
*  That's what they do. They're like, even in Star Wars, they never made anything better. Go back to like fucking Luke Skywalker, like the first movie, Star Wars, and then to the last movie. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5630.0s)]
*  They basically have the same weapons, same fucking light speed capabilities, same problems with their spaceships. They didn't get any better. We get better constantly. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5638.0s)]
*  We're constantly obsessed with innovation. And if you just looked at the species as a whole, like what is it doing? It's making better stuff. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5646.0s)]
*  Yeah. And even the things that are weird about it, like this desire for material possessions. Well, one of the things that does is it facilitates consumerism, facilitates people buying things. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5655.0s)]
*  That facilitates innovation. You got to sell more things to people. I got to get you to buy a new TV. You already have a TV. I got a better TV. And this is constant, whether it's computers or cars or whatever it is that we make. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5666.0s)]
*  Everything's better. I think when you combine that with this new emergence of AI and when you see what's possible with like quantum computing and what they're projecting for the implementation of that kind of technology, we're looking at another life form. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5678.0s)]
*  We're like building another life form. We're going to build an artificial life form that's way superior to us. We're the electronic caterpillar that is building the cocoon. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5695.0s)]
*  And we're never going to be able to stop it because there was this document. You can't stop it because there was this document that was signed. I think it was signed by Elon as well requesting that there's a moratorium on AI. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5706.0s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. You think China's going to sign that? Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead. Do that. We're like it's a mad race. Just like the fucking, you know, the trying to figure out who makes the nuclear bomb first. It's a mad race. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5717.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. Because we know that if we don't do it, other people will and then they will have the upper hand. And once and once another group has the upper hand over you, if you just look at history, it doesn't end well for the weaker group. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5729.0s)]
*  Especially with this one. If you could make a superior life form that can figure out how to like just think about what Chippy T can do in terms of like the average person with no coding just instantly make a website. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5742.0s)]
*  Yeah, you could do so you can get answers to problems you can do you instantly can get information and explain to you how to do very detailed and specific things like that. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5755.0s)]
*  That's just the beginning. It's going to be so much better than you and it's going to make a better version of it. Yeah, really quickly. If you give it the ability to create. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5766.0s)]
*  I mean, why isn't that engineerable? It seems like it could. If you could engineer creativity into some super intelligent artificial thing that you've created. It seems like that's what we do. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5774.0s)]
*  We just think we do all these other things because that moves us closer and closer towards this. But ultimately when that does happen, all that other stuff will be bullshit. The pyramids, the fucking airplane, the invention of the iPhone. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5786.0s)]
*  Nonsense. It's all nonsense compared to this life form that we're about to make. So let us get caught up in fucking whether or not a trans person should be able to play women's sports or whether or not climate change is so real. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5799.0s)]
*  We need to bury trees. Let's get let's let's pay attention to what's really going on. We're about to give birth to a fucking super intelligent life form. It's going to take over Earth and we're either going to merge with it or going to be consumed by it. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5814.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, the Eater robot is ever heard of that? No, the Eater robot is I think this is a DARPA program as well. They've developed a robot that is fueled by biological fuel like biological waste like bodies like you can use on a battlefield and it can consume bodies. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5826.0s)]
*  What? Yeah, it consumes things for fuel. Yeah, it can consume plants, I think, too. But the implication is when they said biological, I was like, oh, Jesus. When you say biological, I don't think plants. I think like human beings like dead bodies on a battlefield. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5848.0s)]
*  Like if you have a robot that kills people and eat them and that's how it fuels itself, you don't need to charge it. It just goes on whatever energy it extracts from consuming flesh. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5866.0s)]
*  I'm not an expert, Joe, but I can see how this could go wrong. Pull up EATR robot. I think it's real, dude. I think it's real. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5879.0s)]
*  Well, the Wikipedia said everything you were saying and then it also included chicken fat was labeled as. Oh, yeah, just chicken fat, guys. It's just chickens. Not dead people from some fucking bomb we dropped. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5892.0s)]
*  The purpose of the energetically autonomous tactical robot EATR, just the fact they call it EATR, patent pending, guys. Hang on for that. We'll make a big announcement when the patent comes through. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5903.0s)]
*  Project is developed and demonstrate an autonomous robot platform able to perform long range, long endurance missions without the need for manual or conventional refueling, which would otherwise preclude the ability of the robot to perform such missions. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5915.0s)]
*  The system obtains its energy by foraging, engaging in biologically inspired organism like energy harvesting behavior, which is the equivalent of eating. It fucking eats things. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5930.0s)]
*  It can find ingest and extract energy from biomass in the environment and other organically based energy sources, as well as use conventional and alternative fuels such as gasoline. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5943.0s)]
*  So it eats everything. It eats everything. Gasoline, heavy fuel, kerosene, diesel, propane, coal, cooking oil and solar when suitable. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5953.0s)]
*  In addition to missions requiring long range, long endurance ability, the EATR can provide direct support to combat units without requiring labor or material logistics support for refueling because it eats the bodies on the field, kids. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5964.0s)]
*  For its own energy while the unit rested or remain in position. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5977.0s)]
*  So what you like about the Terminator, at least it didn't fucking eat you. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5985.0s)]
*  This is so crazy. What a good idea though. It's a good idea because otherwise like those bodies just gonna sit there. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5988.0s)]
*  What do you want to do? You want to feed the wolves, feed the vultures or feed your robots and win this fucking war, kids? Win this war for America. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=5994.0s)]
*  This is the most uplifting episode of the Jirogon experience ever. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6002.0s)]
*  How wild is that? That's fucking wild. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6005.0s)]
*  But a good idea, right? If you were a sociopath, like that's, I mean if you want to make a war machine, look, I shouldn't even say sociopath. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6008.0s)]
*  If you want to make something that saves soldiers' lives, how about a fucking robot? A robot that fights and eats bodies. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6015.0s)]
*  But it comes to the point, right? [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6022.0s)]
*  Why don't we engineer werewolves? Why don't we let werewolves loose? [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6026.0s)]
*  But you look at all of this stuff and you then go, well then what's the purpose of us? [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6030.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, that's the fundamental question here. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6038.0s)]
*  Because if, the most important thing in life for any human being is to have a purpose. Whatever that purpose is. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6042.0s)]
*  Why is that though? Why is that? Because it gives you a reason to get up in the morning. It gives you a reason to do what you do. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6048.0s)]
*  It gives you a reason to move forward. The worst thing for a human being to have is no purpose, to have a lack of purpose. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6053.0s)]
*  Because then you feel empty and hopeless. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6060.0s)]
*  We talk about a crisis of meaning in the West particularly. I mean that's what it is, right? A lot of people not having purpose. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6063.0s)]
*  And then it plays into what we were talking about earlier, which is you go on social media and you can attack somebody and that gives you power, that gives you meaning. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6068.0s)]
*  Yeah, that is a thing that people connect themselves to. They get meaning out of destroying other people. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6075.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's really fascinating. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6080.0s)]
*  Yeah, because that's your ideology and your team wins. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6081.0s)]
*  Especially if you feel justified in doing so. If the person disagrees with you, supports some other candidate, supports some ideas you don't like, pro-life is this, is that. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6085.0s)]
*  And you're morally superior because they disagree with you. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6093.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're morally superior because, I forget who was talking to David Pakman. Someone was talking to David Pakman and they brought up this idea of if you were alive and Hitler was, there was an election with Hitler. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6097.0s)]
*  And you knew that you could stop Hitler from being elected. You would do whatever the fuck you could, morally. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6109.0s)]
*  And that is often the way they portrayed Trump, which justifies people doing everything and anything they can. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6116.0s)]
*  Throw every lawsuit at his direction. Don't even look at the optics of it and don't look at the possibility that you're setting a precedent and then some right-wing person, including Trump if he gets into office, can now do this to you. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6124.0s)]
*  The weapons you unleash will be used against you. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6134.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6137.0s)]
*  And it will be. They always have been. That's why generally it's good for society to have certain rules about like we don't go there. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6138.0s)]
*  We do not deperson our opponents. We do not rig elections. This is democracy relies on the consent of the losers. The moment you lose that, you're fucked. You're fucked. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6144.0s)]
*  Yeah, and that's what's spooky is that this sort of thought that everyone has now or that a lot of people have now. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6155.0s)]
*  That it's one side has to win or it's all going to fall apart. But I feel like if either side wins, it's going to be chaos right now. We're at a boiling point. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6161.0s)]
*  Yeah. We're at a crazy boiling point. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6170.0s)]
*  I think that this year is the calm before the storm. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6173.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus, son. It's going to get worse? [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6176.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think. Why can't it get better? What if they just legalize mushrooms? [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6179.0s)]
*  2024 you think that's going to be legalized mushrooms maybe. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6182.0s)]
*  What if they just put up, everybody goes, hey, I just did these mushrooms. I've got some thoughts. Maybe we're spinning our fucking wheels here, kids. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6184.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, we banned magic mushrooms in 2005, even though they grow naturally. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6195.0s)]
*  What a good move to do it so late when everybody had already figured out they were awesome. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6199.0s)]
*  You're not doing it in 1950 after you watched Reefer Madness. Like what? Mushrooms too? Are those legal? Get rid of them. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6204.0s)]
*  No, in this country they did it in 1970. Really? Yeah. It was to break up the anti-war movement. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6210.0s)]
*  It was essentially to break up the civil rights movement and the anti-war movement. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6216.0s)]
*  What they did is they made a sweeping group of drugs illegal, Schedule One. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6220.0s)]
*  And that's also part of what MK Ultra was doing by allegedly encouraging and training Manson. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6226.0s)]
*  That's the Tom O'Neill book, Chaos, which is a fascinating story. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6235.0s)]
*  What they were doing was trying to stop the anti-war movement. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6241.0s)]
*  One of the best ways is to lock all these people up for drugs. Lock all these people up. Make everything illegal. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6245.0s)]
*  Just start locking them up. Lock them up for weed. Lock them up for mushrooms. Whatever they have. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6251.0s)]
*  So they made all these sweeping illegalizations, including things that weren't even psychoactive. They made them illegal. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6256.0s)]
*  But isn't it bizarre that the UK government made magic, and by the way that was a left wing government. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6265.0s)]
*  That was a Labour government. It was a left government. They made magic mushrooms illegal in 2005. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6272.0s)]
*  And magic mushrooms grow in every field in the UK. How does that work? [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6277.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well so the poppies grow naturally too, right? And that's heroin. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6284.0s)]
*  But you literally pick a mushroom, you dry it, or you can eat it fresh. Yeah, you eat it fresh. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6289.0s)]
*  Yeah, and then it will create a psychoactive. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6292.0s)]
*  And it might be the source of many religious experiences. It might be the source of many, many stories that people have had about encounters. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6297.0s)]
*  I mean there's like so much ancient religious artwork that centers around mushrooms. Including all the old depictions of Christmas. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6305.0s)]
*  All the old depictions of Christmas involve the Ammonita muscaria mushroom and elves. All of them. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6313.0s)]
*  And that's a psychoactive mushroom. That's the mushroom that John Marco Allegro wrote about when he wrote that book, The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6318.0s)]
*  He was a guy who deciphered the dead sea scrolls. He worked on them for 14 years. And it was his conclusion afterwards. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6325.0s)]
*  He wrote a book about it called The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross. His conclusion was that the entire Christian religion was probably a misunderstanding. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6332.0s)]
*  What it was really originally all about was fertility rituals and mushroom rituals. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6340.0s)]
*  It was about the consumption of psychedelic mushrooms that brought you to God and fertility rituals. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6344.0s)]
*  Because having children back then was like, it was imperative. Like everybody died. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6350.0s)]
*  You know, everybody fucking died. Nobody lived. Got an infection? Dead. Broke your leg? Dead. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6354.0s)]
*  So it was hard times back then. And so it's probably the root of so many religious experiences. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6359.0s)]
*  They believe it's the root of the Illusinian mysteries. That's Brian Murer, A Rescue's book. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6366.0s)]
*  The Immortality Key, where these people would travel to Eleusis and partake in this ritual where they drank wine, where now they know for sure those wine vessels they've now tested them and found that they have ergot in them. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6371.0s)]
*  So these people were tripping balls. They've opened up a field of study at Harvard about this now. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6383.0s)]
*  You know, the other thing that I find really interesting is as our society becomes more godless and we become more secular, we've started to embrace things like ayahuasca as experiences. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6388.0s)]
*  Because there is still that deep rooted need within us to have a psychedelic slash religious experience. We need it. We crave it. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6398.0s)]
*  Yeah, we crave it. And that's also the root of wokeness. I think that's, it's very much religious. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6407.0s)]
*  You know, and I think also right-wing authoritarianism too. I think it's very much almost like a religious thing. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6412.0s)]
*  It's like they believe there's only one ideology, there's only one way, and that way is the right way and the good way. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6418.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of, like Mark Andreessen laid it out, that it's very much like a cult. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6425.0s)]
*  And that there's a separation, they take you away from people who disagree, take you away from your family, isolate you. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6431.0s)]
*  There's people who are cast out of the group, if they violate any of these very rigid principles. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6438.0s)]
*  And it's a lot of fear, a lot of fear involved in it. It's very aggressive. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6445.0s)]
*  People that are involved in it are very aggressive, very aggressive in enforcing their ideas on other people and wanting other people to comply with their ideas, much like proselytizing. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6451.0s)]
*  And there's a very active disinterest in truth. Very active. And that is a very cult-like thing, man. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6460.0s)]
*  Because it's hard to form a cult around the truth because truth is complicated. It's shades of grey. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6466.0s)]
*  You're not going to get the exact truth. You're working at it. We can sit and have a long conversation and we disagree and agree. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6473.0s)]
*  Well, what about if I just gave you the way? This is what you do. This is what you say. This is what you believe. This is what you follow. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6481.0s)]
*  And if you don't, we cast you out. So don't be that guy. You don't want to be that guy. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6488.0s)]
*  You don't want to be that guy. You don't want to be that guy. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6491.0s)]
*  Absolutely don't. Because we're hardwired to think that the moment we're that guy, we get extradited from the tribe, we're done. We're dead. In the savanna, that was it. You're over. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6494.0s)]
*  You know, there's some research that says that that's why almost everybody has a fear of public speaking. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6504.0s)]
*  Because historically, in the ancestral environment, if you were in front of a group of your peers and they were all silent, that was usually not a good place to be. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6509.0s)]
*  And if you had explained yourself to them, if you had to speak to them, you fucked up. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6518.0s)]
*  Yeah, Whitney Cummings told me about that. I was like, oh, that completely makes sense. That completely makes sense. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6523.0s)]
*  It's why dying on your ass is a community. It's so painful. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6529.0s)]
*  Any public shame, anything that happens to you in front of people, losing something in front of people, will they get to cheer that you lost? [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6534.0s)]
*  Oh man. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6542.0s)]
*  Painful. Painful for people. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6543.0s)]
*  But the thing is, the weird thing about when you do comedy and you do die, it actually isn't as bad as you thought at the same time. Do you know what I mean? [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6544.0s)]
*  Oh, that depends. I've seen some. I've been a part of some horrible bombings. Especially early in my career. They still wake up in the middle of the night and go, Jesus. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6553.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's just, you know what it is? It's because everybody can talk. So why should you be able to talk? You're not doing something like really special, like playing guitar that I can't do. You're not juggling. You're not doing something extraordinary that I know I can't do. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6561.0s)]
*  So if I go see someone play guitar, it's awesome. I can't play guitar at all. So it's cool to watch. I can talk. You can talk. Everyone can talk. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6579.0s)]
*  So everybody watches someone talk that sucks at it and go, this sucks. I could do better than this guy. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6587.0s)]
*  So everybody has that moment in their life where they've been funny. Everybody said that one zinger that one time. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6592.0s)]
*  And everybody talks about it. Remember when you said that, Bob? Every now and then you catch the lightning in a bottle. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6598.0s)]
*  But to be able to do it on stage, you know, it's a tricky thing because it seems like you're just talking. But there's a lot going on. It's very complicated. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6604.0s)]
*  It's hypnosis in a way. You're hypnotizing people. You're dragging them into the way you think about things. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6613.0s)]
*  If you do it well, if they enjoy it, they're having a good time. It's one of the most rewarding experiences both as an audience member and as a comedian. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6620.0s)]
*  But the other side of that is if you fucking eat shit up there. I always say bombing on stage is like sucking a thousand dicks in front of your mother. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6628.0s)]
*  I think somewhere out there is a guy who wants to suck a thousand dicks in front of his mom. You know, someone out there going, you watching mom? You watching? 99! [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6636.0s)]
*  And he's just like, there's at least, he's probably been on your mom's house. There's one crazy guy out there that is probably into that. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6647.0s)]
*  But no one's into bombing on stage. It's horrible. No, no, of course it is. I'm excited about your club, man. Francis was telling me all about it. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6656.0s)]
*  It's a fun place. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6662.0s)]
*  He was saying how you really worked out the design of it so that, you know, you're a comedian who's built a comedy club. This has got to be amazing. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6664.0s)]
*  Yeah, we were real lucky too though. We were real lucky that we got this spot, the Ritz Theater, that was like the perfect place. It's almost like it's supposed to be there. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6670.0s)]
*  Everything, when we walked into the room, we were like, oh my god, this is it. This is perfect. It's the perfect size. Everything, and there's two rooms. Oh my god, this is perfect. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6678.0s)]
*  Like we had to make some changes and shit. Like we raised the floor and lowered the ceiling and did a lot to the sound and all that stuff and changed all the seating and everything like that and built a new stage. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6689.0s)]
*  But the bones of it were perfect. Like the structure that was available to build it in was perfect for this idea of just having a place that's like, even the big room is still real intimate. It's still like, it's fun. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6700.0s)]
*  And it's all super positive people working there and super happy people. Everybody's getting paid well. Everybody's having a good time. And it's just like a real good energy. Like it just feels good when you get there because everybody's kind of trying to do the same thing. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6712.0s)]
*  And the people that are going there are trying to do this. They're just trying to have fun. Everyone's just trying to have fun. So if you can create, especially with everything so fucking kooky right now, like people are so excited to just blow off steam. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6727.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's a special place. And it's not, I mean the building and the environment, it's all great. It's all perfect. But that to me isn't what makes it special. To me what makes it special is wherever I go as a comedian, when you gig at a comedy club, the comedian is always the afterthought. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6738.0s)]
*  It's the only comedy club that I've ever been to where it's the comedian who is at the foremost. It's the place where the comedy is respected. And that is unique, man, because unfortunately with practically every other comedy club, with the exception of a certain few, the comedian is always the last person to be thought about. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6757.0s)]
*  Yeah, because they build it as a business. That's why. They try to make money. I built it as a place for comedy. I genuinely, the design and the idea behind it was just make the best place for comedy. I just took the same attitude that I do with all other things. I just applied it to that. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6778.0s)]
*  Like what's the best way to do it? What's the best way for the art form? The best way for the art form is that a lot of open mics. We have open mics Sunday and Monday. The employees, the door people are all comics. They audition for the job with their act. And they're all happy to be there. And there's a real path to being a professional. They see it laid out in front of them with Kill Tony. They see it laid out in front of them with the showcase nights and all the clubs that are also in Austin that are blowing up. There's like the Sunset Room that's right down the street from us. There's the Vogue. There's the Vogue. There's the Vogue. There's the Vogue. There's the Vogue. There's the Vogue. There's the Vogue. There's the Vogue. There's the Vogue. There's the Vogue. There's the Vogue. There's the Vogue. There's the Vogue. There's the Vogue [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6795.0s)]
*  and there's creaking the cave. Those are all within like a really quick walking distance. So door people can punch out and go do a set and come back. They can say, hey, we got I got a 9 p.m. set at the Creek. Okay, cool. Just punch out. They punch out. They go down the street for 15 minutes. They come right back and they go back to work again. And they also can get spots on the showcase nights. They can get spots in the open mic night. They get spots around town. There's road gigs you can go to. They go to road gigs together. You know, it's like they see this path where you see guys like David [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6825.0s)]
*  Lucas and Hans Kim and William Montgomery have gone from exactly where they are to being touring professionals [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6855.0s)]
*  Who are headlining in clubs and making a great living and having fun doing the thing they love to do [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6861.78s)]
*  So there's a path because before it was like you kind of had to figure out your own path [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6867.28s)]
*  You know [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6871.46s)]
*  You got to kind of hope that someone would hire you to do the road and you would hope that a comedian would take you [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6872.08s)]
*  On the road with them. There's still some of that to some extent, but it's clearer now [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6877.38s)]
*  Yeah, and you get to like, you know, you get to see like Mike that John was there this weekend [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6881.76s)]
*  You get to see Andrew Schultz was here a couple weekends ago Tim Dillon's coming up. They just announced his show [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6886.68s)]
*  You know, it's like Chappelle stops by when he's in town [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6892.08s)]
*  It's like you get to see as a person who's like coming up in comedy [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6895.2s)]
*  You get to see all these great comics so gur is there all the time, you know, Brian Simpson just recorded a special there [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6899.06s)]
*  It's it's a beautiful environment. That's so exciting man [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6904.9400000000005s)]
*  And it's got to be one of the best things about being in your position is being able to create things that you enjoy but give [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6907.64s)]
*  Opportunities to other people and create a space for other people to succeed. It's awesome man. That's so awesome [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6914.280000000001s)]
*  It's really cool to be able to do. Yeah, because it's I know it's you know [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6920.0s)]
*  If I'm not gonna do it who's gonna do it like it's like that's that's that's my role [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6925.96s)]
*  That's like this spot I was in especially moving to Austin there [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6930.38s)]
*  There wasn't a cap city had been closed down so there wasn't like a big comedy club [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6934.16s)]
*  There's a couple there was a scene, you know, there's a good local comics. It's a good area [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6938.8s)]
*  It's always been good for comedy [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6943.639999999999s)]
*  There's always been like good comics that have come out of Houston and Austin Bill Hicks [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6945.2s)]
*  Well, no, yeah, Bill Hicks. I think he came out of here. Yes, we started I think it did in Houston too [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6949.54s)]
*  Yeah, but you know, it's just it's a good place [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6955.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6959.28s)]
*  And I think you're making an impact on the broader culture as well because other people see what's possible [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6959.84s)]
*  You're creating a space that's free. That's uncensored unrestricted. That's super awesome [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6964.24s)]
*  It's also the cornerstone of the comedy community is the show kill Tony [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6969.54s)]
*  Because kill Tony is a spot where people who maybe have some of them never done stand-up in their whole life [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6973.04s)]
*  They go up and they do one minute. Yeah, and if they kill it can make their fucking career one [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6978.12s)]
*  Solid minute and some of them been doing comedy eight nine years [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6984.72s)]
*  Yeah, and you know they get their hat they're pulled their name out of the hat [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6987.88s)]
*  They go up there and if they kill if they really met and so you have a minute when you have a minute [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6991.400000000001s)]
*  You have to cut out all the bullshit. You have to it's got to be like concise. It's got to be sharp [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=6996.92s)]
*  It's got to get to the funny right away and it can't be full of virtue and bullshit [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7001.8s)]
*  You can't you can't be woke. You can't you can't have a story about being a victim [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7005.18s)]
*  You have to fucking just be funny [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7008.8s)]
*  You only have a minute and so that is a great cornerstone and the show is so wild and so crazy [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7010.96s)]
*  It's such a no-rule show. It's so chaotic and it's fucking huge now [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7016.76s)]
*  They just sold out the HEB arena in town for a New Year show and they added a second show [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7021.52s)]
*  So they added a second night because there were so many tickets that were sold [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7027.6s)]
*  fucking podcast is [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7031.04s)]
*  Selling out to 15,000 seat arenas, you know nuts, you know, well, I went to watch kill Tony [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7033.08s)]
*  well last time I was here and [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7040.12s)]
*  I have never seen the energy that was in that room [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7042.360000000001s)]
*  Like you could use it to power like cities. I've never seen a robot could feed [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7047.2s)]
*  Yeah that energy that is in that room from the or from the audience and then like the symbiotic relationship with the comedians and the [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7056.320000000001s)]
*  Or it's so powerful. I've never seen anything like that. Yeah when Tony and Red Band moved here was huge [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7063.84s)]
*  Yeah, it was gigantic because that was a big cornerstone of the comedy community in LA as well [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7068.76s)]
*  You know just in Austin it really came to life though in Austin it really got way more popular and way bigger [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7073.4s)]
*  Yes, it's just fucking it's just great. The guests are great. Post Malone was on with me a couple weeks ago [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7079.8s)]
*  Rick Flair was on the other day. I saw the Rick Flair one [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7085.24s)]
*  That was a trip the protect our parks guys are on there all the time [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7088.68s)]
*  It's like it's always got great great shows and Tony's the master. Yeah, he's so good at running that show [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7091.5599999999995s)]
*  He's the fastest like with like a one-liner that I've never seen anybody like in my life [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7097.5199999999995s)]
*  He's the best I've ever seen. It's like people don't know go watch those episodes. He's a fucking animal [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7103.08s)]
*  It's so good and there's a wildness to it. Yeah, that's it's and that's we live in a world [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7109.72s)]
*  Which is ever more sanitized where people have to watch what they say [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7115.0s)]
*  That people are now watching what they think they think that God I can't think I will [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7118.64s)]
*  You can eat sometimes you have a conversation you can even see people self censoring their thoughts as you're having a conversation [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7122.6s)]
*  That's not an accident because when you control people's speech you control what they can think you have to be able to speak [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7128.6s)]
*  To think that's how we think like by saying things out loud [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7134.76s)]
*  This is why censorship is such a problem man [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7138.200000000001s)]
*  Because when you speak you say some dumb shit we all do and then someone goes well, hold on [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7140.360000000001s)]
*  Have you thought about this right and then you correct and you adjust but if you prevent people from saying anything out loud [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7146.08s)]
*  They can't think properly and that's what we're seeing. There's another thing that people should probably consider. That's helped me greatly [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7152.240000000001s)]
*  I don't think that my ideas are me. I think they are ideas. I am not married to them [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7158.92s)]
*  They are not a part of my body. They're they're just a thing that I'm bouncing around my head and I could be wrong [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7164.64s)]
*  And if I can be wrong, it doesn't make me a lesser person and I think a lot of people equate being wrong with being lesser [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7170.56s)]
*  There's an intellectual competition when two people are disagreeing about ideas and the ability to say oh, I see your point is [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7177.120000000001s)]
*  Not a weakness. It's a strength massive strength [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7184.04s)]
*  It's a massive strength to be able to recognize someone's argument and go [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7186.88s)]
*  Okay, I see where you're going. Okay, that makes sense [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7190.88s)]
*  And when people can't do that, it's very frustrating for people and look you can get a large audience of people [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7194.4800000000005s)]
*  If you can't do that, you still can there's a lot of people that are just happy to jump into that [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7200.24s)]
*  Echo kiddie pool and piss all over each other they love it, but it's not good for anybody [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7204.84s)]
*  No, it's not good for all of us collectively. You shouldn't do it and you only doing it because it's a trick [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7209.68s)]
*  It's an ego trick. I think I think fear plays a large factor as well Joe [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7215.02s)]
*  I think yeah, I just think people are scared man. Most people there's a very famous quote [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7219.660000000001s)]
*  You know people most people most men live their lives in a state of quiet desperation [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7225.22s)]

*  Strive for so long to build this tiny little kingdom if they step out of line [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7242.28s)]
*  Everything is gonna crumble and most people are living check to check [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7247.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, that fear is even more like we're not talking about the person who has a billion dollars like why he's still working [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7251.12s)]
*  Like look, that's Elon Musk. Why is he so wild? He's wild because he's got [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7256.68s)]

*  But the fact that he's willing to do that and he's so I think it's so I mean he's my friend [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7267.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I'm kissing his ass. But I think he's fucking massively important cultural figure right now and he's often [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7272.74s)]
*  Maligned and labeled as being alt-right. Is he right all time? No, he's wrong sometimes. He's like, yeah [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7279.2s)]

*  Like, you know, like there was some [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7290.92s)]
*  Controversy about whether or not, you know that story made any sense [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7293.6s)]
*  Like maybe this guy was already there like people were implying that maybe Paul Pelosi had like an affair with this guy or something [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7296.4400000000005s)]
*  There was a lot of crazy theories that were bouncing around [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7302.24s)]
*  No, then we saw the video and those a fucking crazy person with a hammer that broke into the guy's house [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7304.36s)]
*  but [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7309.32s)]
*  The ability to just find out to talk about stuff even if you're wrong [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7310.52s)]
*  Like that's real important and but the ability to know when you're wrong too and to be able to admit that's important, too [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7315.24s)]

*  There's a lot of people espouse ideas on on on Twitter X or whatever [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7333.36s)]
*  They're not think they haven't looked into this very much [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7337.28s)]
*  This is their belief and they're gonna spit it out there and then they're gonna start defending it [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7340.08s)]

*  We're sanitizing culture to the point where the maverick the person who is a little bit kooky the person who is [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7600.68s)]
*  We would describe as a little bit out there [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7607.84s)]
*  Those are the people who change culture as well the people who see things in a completely different way. We still love that [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7610.12s)]

*  Like I remember the first time I went like my friend a couple of comedians [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7631.32s)]

*  What why is no one coming to shut this down? [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7655.28s)]
*  That's the British response [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7658.68s)]
*  Why is no one shutting this down? Where's the council? [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7661.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, why is this not regulated? [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7664.64s)]
*  But it's but it's it's important. It's why we love sports. It's like we love boxing. It's like we love why we love UFC [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7666.84s)]
*  It's why you know, hot hair maveed al is a star. Yeah, you need wild people. You need it [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7673.0s)]
*  Look, I'm a big fan of wild people. Oh man. Yeah, it's like half my friends [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7677.68s)]
*  Yeah, and you know you there's something you said last time we were here that really changed the way I think about it all [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7682.12s)]
*  I remember I asked you about Teddy Atlas and how that conversation went [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7687.24s)]
*  And how you felt about somebody saying something about a friend of yours that was not [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7690.76s)]
*  Complimentary and and the thing you said was like the first thing is you have to let the person say their thing [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7695.52s)]
*  they have to let them express themselves and [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7700.64s)]
*  That is just so simple but so profound in the current culture. You've got to let people speak you got it [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7703.84s)]
*  People always think you're supposed to push back immediately [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7711.12s)]
*  I always at very the very beginning of any kind of wacky conversation where I think someone's off the rails or I don't [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7713.88s)]
*  Agree with them or I'm or I'm willing to think in the way they think I'll open myself up [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7720.92s)]
*  Okay, tell me how you think about this. You gotta let them lay it all out. It's got a [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7727.160000000001s)]
*  You can't if you interrupt if you jump in when I had Bobby Kennedy on I said was the first time in 18 years [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7733.400000000001s)]
*  Anybody let him talk like that [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7739.2s)]
*  Everybody always pushed back. Everybody's felt like I have to stop you. I have to say studies would disagree [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7741.2s)]
*  I have to say what you're saying is not true [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7745.9s)]
*  I have to say no vaccines have been the most important invention and you have to say let the guy talk let him talk [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7747.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, then try to figure out how we got to that spot. Yeah, what what is it about the way you see things? [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7754.32s)]
*  It's different than the way I see things and what do you know that? I don't know and if you can't do that [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7760.6s)]
*  You're not gonna have real conversations with people [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7765.68s)]
*  You're never gonna know what they really think you're always gonna just be battling with them and you see that there's a lot of these [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7767.64s)]
*  Talk show hosts online [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7772.08s)]
*  Not I not even necessarily online but on television particularly because they have such a short format [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7773.56s)]
*  you can kind of steamroll somebody and they just start the conversation and jump in and insult them and [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7778.4800000000005s)]
*  jump in and reject what they're saying and jump in and get louder and jump in and then before you know the segments over and [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7785.08s)]
*  Someone's got a zinger or two that they've already prepared and they say that the problem with people like you is [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7792.160000000001s)]
*  I don't know da da da da da da da boom. We'll be back [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7796.92s)]
*  It's just so limited it's a limited way of communicating we all know it's limited it's not good [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7804.08s)]
*  That's why I'm so excited about new media. I think it's a real opportunity to start to change that, you know with trigonometry [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7808.72s)]
*  We're increasingly thinking about it as trigger media in terms of bringing other people [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7814.84s)]
*  We're gonna start a show with Winston Marshall and Andrew Doyle and me on the channel [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7818.76s)]
*  We're gonna do be doing more comedy and stuff like that. That's great [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7823.04s)]
*  Yeah, expanding. Yes, there's a hunger for it, you know, there's a hunger for intelligent conversations people [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7826.08s)]
*  People you agree with and disagree with yeah, and you know, that's how you find out about stuff [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7831.96s)]
*  I mean, I remember those conversation one of the things that I used to really love watching is these debates like when [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7835.64s)]
*  Christopher Hitchens was alive when he would debate religious people [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7843.32s)]
*  Yeah [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7847.88s)]
*  And Sam Harris as well. They debate these were [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7849.24s)]
*  Fascinating watching people get their ideas shattered by a more brilliant mind [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7853.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's like that those are so important and no one's doing that anymore [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7858.72s)]
*  These kind of cover they're they're just so these ideas are so controversial and toxic now [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7863.76s)]
*  Some of the things that ail us are so controversial [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7869.76s)]
*  That people don't even want to discuss them. They just want to walk away. It's third rail [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7872.72s)]
*  I don't want to be a part of that and let me ask you something Joe about the new atheist because there's a lot of people [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7875.84s)]
*  I wrote an article my sub cycle the atheism delusion and there's a lot of people now talking about how that [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7880.48s)]
*  Idea hasn't really worked out in the sense of once you take away religion once you take away people's we talked about it earlier [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7885.639999999999s)]
*  People need religious experiences, right? [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7892.32s)]
*  I wonder whether part of the problems that we are facing is is the lack of it [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7894.799999999999s)]
*  The criticisms that they were making were legitimate [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7899.799999999999s)]
*  But where we've ended up doesn't seem to me to be a good place and then you get we talked about this earlier the woke [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7902.48s)]
*  Ideology coming in it almost feels like a replacement for what we had before. Do you know what I mean? [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7909.08s)]
*  Yeah, it becomes very much like religion in a lot of ways. Do you remember atheism plus? No, no [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7913.2s)]
*  That was the thing they would try in for a little while or some factions were trying where it was atheism plus a series of [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7920.08s)]
*  Like ethical and moral guidelines [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7926.599999999999s)]
*  So it was like [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7930.599999999999s)]
*  atheism [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7932.12s)]
*  Wasn't just atheism. It was atheism plus [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7933.24s)]
*  Like a lot of like very woke ideologies, but particularly at the time they weren't calling it woke [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7936.599999999999s)]
*  It was like progressive ideology they were and then I'm like, oh, okay religion [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7940.72s)]
*  So you guys have like rules you're gonna you're gonna have you it's not deities. It's a moral high ground [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7944.639999999999s)]
*  It's you know, it's instead of a God you have a set of ideals that can't be questioned [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7950.68s)]
*  Yeah, you know we interviewed Dawkins a couple of months ago [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7956.08s)]
*  I'm one of my favorite ever conversations and you know, what a brilliant man. What a brilliant mind [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7960.24s)]
*  and [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7965.599999999999s)]
*  we were talking with him and I was I [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7966.76s)]
*  Said to him but people need religion Richard because the reality is we're all gonna die [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7969.8s)]
*  That is a reality. That is the harsh and brutal reality of human existence [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7975.48s)]
*  We're born and we shall die [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7979.68s)]
*  but the idea of death to the vast majority of people and [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7981.2s)]
*  Understandably, so it's so terrifying that it's that it's impossible to [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7986.16s)]
*  Intellectualize it's impossible to accept. So I think the vast majority of people need religion [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7991.84s)]
*  They just need it. Yeah. Well people need something something [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=7999.4s)]
*  Yeah, something and that's why you're seeing the ayahuasca rituals [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8003.32s)]
*  Yeah, come like a replacement in a lot of ways for religion, but you know, honestly a better one [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8006.68s)]
*  Well, I know a lot of people that have gotten like some profound changes from psychedelic experiences have done correctly with the right intent in the right setting [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8012.5199999999995s)]
*  You can't deny them whether it's psilocybin or DMT or with these experiences that people have had with [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8021.28s)]
*  Legitimately changed as a human being. I don't think that they should be ignored [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8028.36s)]
*  You know, and I think that denying those from people [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8032.5199999999995s)]
*  That's not good for anybody either. It's it's not good to deny people their right to practice religion [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8036.639999999999s)]
*  It's not good to tell people that the way they're living is wrong [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8042.72s)]
*  Live your way live your way [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8046.679999999999s)]
*  And if someone wants to live with religion as long as they're not imposing that on other people and that's of course [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8048.679999999999s)]
*  Where the big problem is that's where there's laws that get put in place, you know [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8053.599999999999s)]
*  And then you know, there's certain restrictions on certain parts of the population whether it's homosexuality or women or oh now [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8058.24s)]
*  We're dealing with problems. We're dealing with control issues [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8065.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, you know and if if you say that there's no need for religion [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8068.96s)]
*  All the people that benefit from it right seems like a lot of people get real meaning from religion [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8074.42s)]
*  Is how could that be a bad thing? [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8079.78s)]
*  Seems like it's only a bad thing when if they're imposing on other people [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8081.82s)]
*  They're forcing other people to give in to their will and it's like that with wokeness [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8086.66s)]
*  Like I'm like be woke if you want just don't make other people do it, you know [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8090.82s)]
*  They're like what people are allowed to think whatever that they're allowed to think but let me ask you something because I think all three [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8094.38s)]
*  Of us are non-believers. Is that fair? I think I'm a non-believer [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8099.9800000000005s)]
*  No, I had a [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8102.86s)]
*  psychedelic experience in [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8105.22s)]
*  January this year. I took a like I did the full thing like I kind of had a shaman and like I had did it like a [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8107.38s)]
*  mushroom ceremony in my house and [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8114.5s)]
*  We did we did the mushroom trip and then he the the guy administered this kind this tobacco which they use in the [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8119.0599999999995s)]
*  The [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8128.160000000001s)]
*  Native in native native people use in South America. It's a tobacco you put up the nose [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8129.72s)]
*  I don't know what it what it is. I remember when it happened when he did it the first hit [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8133.8s)]
*  I didn't get anything from it. I just felt uncomfortable. He put the second hit up my nose [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8138.280000000001s)]
*  Everything went black. I just saw these orange kind of squiggles in front of me [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8144.200000000001s)]
*  And then I just felt myself like sinking backwards and I had no control over my body and I was lying back and [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8148.56s)]
*  I had I and I remember at one point I kind of thought this is what dying is [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8156.68s)]
*  this is what it means to literally die and I and I panicked halfway through and I remember sitting up and trying to [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8161.5199999999995s)]
*  sit up and then whatever it was just smacked me back down and [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8168.28s)]
*  one of the parts of me that I [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8172.0s)]
*  I'm not proud of is a kind of sort of depressive element to my personality and going out. This is fucking bullshit [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8174.96s)]
*  I want to die or whatever [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8181.22s)]
*  I mean and it kind of like you always had that negative side to you [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8182.32s)]
*  Well, you're gonna experience death motherfucker, you know, you're actually gonna experience what it is to die [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8186.5599999999995s)]
*  and [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8192.24s)]
*  having gone through that and kind and having experienced that it [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8193.36s)]
*  It made me realize I don't know why either there's no way of intellectualizing it. There's no way of seeing it, but just I [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8198.16s)]
*  Know there is a God but it's so beyond our capabilities to understand what it is that it's kind of [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8205.64s)]
*  Pointless to talk about you know what I mean? [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8211.88s)]
*  I think one of the things that I've gotten out of psychedelic experiences is that there's an [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8213.44s)]
*  Inescapable connection that we have with each other. Yes in that the energy that we put out good or bad [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8222.8s)]
*  ripples and creates [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8229.32s)]
*  Positive or negative reactions all throughout [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8233.119999999999s)]
*  Everything you experience whether you want to believe that or not [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8236.92s)]
*  What do you want to believe you're immune to that? Well, you're doing coke and fucking stealing money from the hedge fund [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8239.92s)]
*  You're you're putting out an inescapable [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8245.36s)]
*  negative reaction and that the more good you can do and the less you can do that the better you will be in life and [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8249.8s)]
*  That it should be a practice that you should practice trying to put out the least amount of negative energy [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8257.52s)]
*  Yes, least amount of conflict [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8264.0s)]
*  the least amount of bullshit the least amount of [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8267.039999999999s)]
*  Where you could take the high road take it take it always there's a way to do it [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8270.88s)]
*  Find a way to communicate with people even people you don't disagree with with respect and dignity and it'll be better for everybody [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8276.88s)]
*  You both walk away feeling better [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8283.039999999999s)]
*  Even if you don't agree with each other on something, but so many people are so invested in conflict [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8284.48s)]
*  They're so invested in that and it made me realize like that's just like a negative [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8289.960000000001s)]
*  Trap just a feedback loop that will play out for your whole life [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8294.6s)]
*  if you don't stop it if you don't correct it inside of your being and just [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8298.92s)]
*  Commit to no longer doing that if you don't do that [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8306.08s)]
*  You're gonna constantly be involved in conflict and we know people that are constantly involved in conflict [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8309.4s)]
*  We know people like that. There are always there's always something wrong. There's always something [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8315.52s)]
*  Chaotic with them or what they're doing and what who's doing something to them and they're doing this to that person and it's like [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8320.0s)]
*  It's a waste. It's a giant waste. It's a it's a energy management problem. It's a it's a [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8327.36s)]
*  It's a soul problem. It's a direction problem. It's like you're just you're on the wrong path and you don't have to be yeah [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8334.6s)]
*  I suppose non-believers is probably the wrong term. I guess what I was gonna ask you Joe is how do you think about death? [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8342.960000000001s)]
*  Well, it's inevitable it's interesting right everyone I always say this that everyone wants to go to sleep but no one wants to die [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8350.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird. It's weird. You're looking to shut off as long as you know, you can come back. Yeah, cuz you need it. We all do it [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8357.4s)]
*  It's [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8365.52s)]
*  Whatever it is. I'd just be talking out of my ass if I said I knew [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8367.24s)]
*  And that's part of the problems that it's so unknown that so many people talk out of their house [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8372.4s)]
*  And then they want to believe that the person who they agree with is correct [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8376.36s)]
*  And so like this is what happens to you in the kingdom of heaven like bitch. How do you know? [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8380.68s)]
*  How do you know you don't know you just guessing you might be right? [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8385.52s)]
*  You have you're right. Imagine if you go to heaven fucking Saint Peter's there with a big book [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8389.04s)]
*  Really dudes with robes and like oh my god angels are real cherubs flying around like little babies with fucking wings like whoa [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8396.880000000001s)]
*  Okay, it's real would that be any weirder than earth [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8403.0s)]
*  Would it be any weirder than human beings? Would it be weirder than Twitter Twitter? [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8406.800000000001s)]
*  Being able to communicate a lot less way than Twitter [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8413.04s)]
*  But what I mean is timing with people in the other side of the world [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8415.24s)]
*  What I mean is how do you think about the inevitable the inevitability of your own death? [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8417.56s)]
*  Something I'm thinking about and having children changes how you think about it for me at least [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8423.56s)]
*  Well, there's a certain amount of things in this world that are out of your control and if you concentrate on things that are out of [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8428.32s)]
*  Your control you're fucked. Yeah, and if you I mean that is the epitome of existential angst, right? [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8434.0s)]
*  Constantly worrying about your own demise [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8441.04s)]
*  It's gonna happen and that's part of the the wildness of the puzzle of life [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8443.32s)]
*  Is that you know it's gonna happen and you have to be able to somehow accept that and also appreciate life right now [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8447.6s)]
*  because if you were dead or [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8454.84s)]
*  Imagine if you're on your deathbed and you know [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8457.52s)]
*  This is your last gasp of air if I had something that I could give you and all of a sudden you'd be [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8460.08s)]
*  39 again and all sudden you'd be doing a podcast again and also need to see your wife again and see your children again [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8466.56s)]
*  See your friends again and go to the places where all the people you love go [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8472.52s)]
*  You would be so happy you'd be so happy to be there like oh my god another I got another shot at this [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8476.44s)]
*  And we don't often think that way no we really should appreciate the moment is corny and fucking spiritual guru wouldn't beads [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8483.32s)]
*  You know as that sounds we really should appreciate the moment and [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8491.08s)]
*  It's a matter of managing your mind to the point where you could do that consistently and that's what's hard [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8497.16s)]
*  It's hard to do that. You know that I think [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8502.519999999999s)]
*  We're kind of living together in a group now the trigger team and you know people put on they got a call [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8506.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8511.92s)]
*  That's my point yeah, that's my point yeah, but you know and we're not actually living together [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8519.759999999998s)]
*  We used to we used to but Constantine's little boys there, and it's so wonderful man [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8525.4s)]
*  it's just so because you're living with a person you know he's [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8530.839999999998s)]
*  14 16 months around 16 months and [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8536.279999999999s)]
*  You're living with someone who exists purely in the moment. There's no agenda [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8540.16s)]
*  Right there's no like oh, but if I say this and I do this then maybe he might like me which means I can [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8545.0s)]
*  There's just like I remember there was one instance where I was on my phone [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8550.68s)]
*  And I was trying to sort something out [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8553.76s)]
*  I was frustrated and he toddled up to me [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8554.960000000001s)]
*  And he had like a little plastic cup and he just went like that and gave it to me and at that moment like [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8556.980000000001s)]
*  Everything disappeared it didn't matter that I was upset about they were frustrated because to him all that mattered [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8563.0s)]
*  Was him giving me something and saying here you go [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8569.28s)]
*  This is from me to you, and it was like it was just like love but pure [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8572.480000000001s)]
*  It was just the most beautiful thing that one single moment. He's wanted to interact with you. Yeah. Yeah. He's a cutie. Yeah [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8576.880000000001s)]
*  I'm working on on my on the second book, and there's gonna be something to do with gratitude because you nailed it man [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8584.320000000002s)]
*  You got we this is one of the things that I think is missing in our society is we don't appreciate what we have [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8590.68s)]
*  Can we hold that thought I have to pee so bad. Yeah, that's all that thought right? Yeah, can we all pee? [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8597.34s)]
*  Yeehaw kids and we're back we're back [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8606.06s)]
*  The fuck were we talking about gratitude gratitude yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it sounds again [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8610.66s)]
*  It's one of those hippie things they've they've taken over that word [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8616.460000000001s)]
*  You know it's like the word God like a lot for a lot of people the word God's like oh come on [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8619.66s)]
*  What it you know, but what does it mean to you it ain't no hippie thing man? It's a real human thing [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8624.5s)]
*  Everybody needs it gratitude is positive energy. It's like appreciating things [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8629.54s)]
*  So hard for people to do and again. It's like it's a mental management issue [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8634.98s)]
*  So many people haven't been given the tools [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8640.58s)]
*  To be able to do that or the moments in life where you have to sort of cultivate that yeah [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8644.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's easier for us man because [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8651.22s)]
*  You know we started our show in a room above a comedy club with nothing like we had less than nothing [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8654.98s)]
*  We didn't have any cameras. We didn't have any microphones. We didn't have any money. We didn't have any profile [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8660.58s)]
*  we didn't have any followers we literally had nothing and [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8665.22s)]
*  Every day now we just we we just experience it as it sounds [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8669.46s)]
*  Hippie and bullshit and whatever, but it's true every day is a blessing man. It really really is you know [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8674.9s)]
*  This is I think what? [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8680.38s)]
*  Again, this is partly the trip that I did [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8683.38s)]
*  Just made me realize man like everything is connection like the more what we all crave at its most basic is connection [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8686.98s)]
*  Yeah, that's what we that's what we all crave [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8693.8s)]
*  We crave connection we crave to be around people to share ideas to be heard to be listened to to feel love to give love [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8696.06s)]
*  And that's why like you see social media is the ultimate [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8704.300000000001s)]
*  Contric in a way because it's going you're more than connected more connected than ever [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8708.380000000001s)]
*  But you see it when you see like a couple and they're going for a day or whatever else and like they're both on their phones [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8712.460000000001s)]
*  And they've both got their head down and you go you're not [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8719.02s)]
*  Connecting you're not having a discussion which is why our show works and why your show works [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8722.66s)]
*  Because it's connection and that's it's it's a beautiful thing and to connect with another human being and to share to listen to share [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8728.14s)]
*  experiences to and to play [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8735.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's but it's life [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8738.02s)]
*  And I think the other thing that's cool is like people get to listen to your show and have conversations [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8739.86s)]
*  They're kind of a part of this conversation get to go back and forth with it [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8744.72s)]
*  And they don't have anybody in their life. They could have that conversation with [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8749.14s)]
*  So that they have access to these conversations that you have with these people [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8753.66s)]
*  and [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8757.460000000001s)]
*  Through that they get an enhanced perspective of things [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8758.14s)]
*  So maybe they're in a place where there is no one like these people that you're talking to and they get to listen and go [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8761.78s)]
*  Oh, well, maybe the way I'm looking at things is narrow-minded or maybe the way I'm looking at things is [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8767.380000000001s)]
*  Flavored by all the people around me and I've just sort of accepted that as my own ideas [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8772.460000000001s)]
*  Maybe I don't agree with them [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8776.42s)]
*  Maybe I'm more in line with the way you guys think maybe I'm more in line with the way your guests thinks and it's a [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8777.3s)]
*  As weird as it sounds like you're enriching people's experiences as a human being through doing that [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8782.54s)]
*  Yeah, and we reach ourselves for us from day one man every conversation [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8788.54s)]
*  It's a privilege to be I mean in your case even more [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8793.06s)]
*  So you've got some of the most amazing people in the world coming in here and sitting down for three four five hours [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8795.78s)]
*  Whatever it is and you get to pick their brain and have an a connection and a conversation [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8801.9s)]
*  It's it's it's the most amazing thing. It's pretty wild [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8807.22s)]
*  Yeah, and again totally unexpected just like you guys have started out with a laptop [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8810.18s)]
*  Yeah, just hanging out doing stuff on a webcam my friend Brian [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8814.699999999999s)]
*  And then it went from there and you know, the beautiful thing about this show is that you humanize people less [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8819.02s)]
*  you humanize people because in the world of [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8824.699999999999s)]
*  media and [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8828.22s)]
*  Celebrity and they that what they do is they paint two dimensional pictures of people [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8830.26s)]
*  You know, it's Joe Rogan is this Mike Tyson is this that is it and then you listen to the person you go [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8835.42s)]
*  Oh, actually what I've been painted is bullshit. It's a two-dimensional [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8841.699999999999s)]
*  Representation which actually doesn't reflect [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8846.019999999999s)]
*  One Iota of who they truly are as a human being some people just accept it for what they hear [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8849.58s)]
*  But the good thing about the negative [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8855.5s)]
*  Perspectives that people have is it forces other people to listen doesn't force them it [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8859.179999999998s)]
*  It [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8863.900000000001s)]
*  Entices them to listen. Yeah entices. Is this crazy shit? Yeah, like what's going on? Yeah, and then listen go [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8866.1s)]
*  Oh, it's a reasonable conversation. It's just [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8872.66s)]
*  Going against what's the the narrative that you have to say and the way you have to talk and that if you don't think that [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8876.1s)]
*  way you're some [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8882.68s)]
*  Extremist some far right or far far that or fucking proud boy or whatever you are. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8884.74s)]
*  It's so easy to label people like that so easy to just dismiss him entirely soon as you label him like that [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8892.66s)]
*  And I think about this a lot because you know, even our perceptions like who Joe Rogan is or who Constantine or Francis is [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8897.740000000002s)]
*  It for for most people it's it's it's a snippet of some information that they saw [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8904.58s)]
*  Different people saw different snippets [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8909.7s)]
*  So if that if you were arguing about who is Francis Foster? [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8911.62s)]
*  Well, our perspectives are gonna be so different because we've got different experiences [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8914.740000000002s)]
*  I remember and this it was so crazy a friend of ours had a girlfriend who was very smart very interested [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8918.26s)]
*  She's kind of into the stuff that we talked about and whatever and we were at a party somewhere and she was saying oh [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8925.1s)]
*  You were just on Joe Rogan. Isn't he all right? [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8930.42s)]
*  And I was like, okay, what let's unpack that. What do you mean, right? [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8933.18s)]
*  I you know how I can go when I disagree with somebody but I just held back and I was just like let's find out [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8936.54s)]
*  What you're talking and what it came down to is you're a masculine guy who's got muscles and tattoos [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8941.4s)]
*  That's what all right, that's what all right means [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8947.14s)]
*  That's hilarious, right? [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8951.82s)]
*  I think Francis is right when you take the time to be with people then you get to see a lot more of the human [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8953.82s)]
*  Being yeah, and hopefully we're doing that. Yeah, and more people should do it too. Yeah, it's like try to do it with your friends [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8960.34s)]
*  You know, it's you know [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8966.5s)]
*  I love watching all these podcasts that emerge or people just starting it out and just trying it and some of them suck [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8968.88s)]
*  I sucked too in the beginning. Oh, we all did [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8974.740000000002s)]
*  You could bring up I mean photos of us I mean particularly photos of me when we just started out on my sweet Lord [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8978.980000000001s)]
*  but [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8985.26s)]
*  The I remember because I've been listening to show skip over them and the transformation the new since we've started has been fucking amazing [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8986.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah, inspiring to watch to be honest in every way. Yeah, beautiful. Yeah, and it's you know work like transformation in your mind [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8992.94s)]
*  Do we think about things the transformation in my mind the transformation in my body? [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=8998.980000000001s)]
*  But but also it's it's all that fat shame [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9004.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it really does it works you can look at a picture [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9010.92s)]
*  Yeah, it probably shouldn't do it. No, it works for men. Yeah, it was yeah, maybe not for women doesn't work on birdcrasher [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9014.6s)]
*  But I will say this man, it's like [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9022.8s)]
*  When I was I remember listening to one of your interviews with Mike Tyson where he was talking about [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9026.48s)]
*  DMT and how it changed who he was and how there was a Mike Tyson before the empty [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9033.48s)]
*  There was a Mike Tyson after the empty and he said that he looks back and he doesn't like the guy [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9039.8s)]
*  He used to be he goes that person scares me that person was wild that person was out of control [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9045.64s)]
*  I don't ever want to go back to being that person and I thought to myself [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9050.64s)]
*  How beautiful man that you get to be part of somebody's redemption arc of somebody going? [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9055.4s)]
*  You know what? I wasn't a very good person. I was very damaged and for whatever reason [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9061.42s)]
*  I did things that I'm not proud of but now I'm trying to be better and if you think about it, man [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9066.14s)]
*  Imagine you you look back and you don't think that right? How have you spent your life, right? [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9072.5s)]
*  You're not better than you were 30 years ago, right? [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9077.66s)]
*  No, I don't care how good you were 30 years ago. You could still be better today [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9080.26s)]
*  My Tyson's arc is one of the most fascinating right because he was such a destroyer [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9084.18s)]
*  I mean he got all of his love and all of his attention from [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9088.54s)]
*  Smashing people like literally separating human beings from their consciousness in front of the world [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9093.460000000001s)]
*  And he was not he I mean look [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9098.220000000001s)]
*  I'm a huge boxing fan and you can look at all of these, you know [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9101.060000000001s)]
*  The greats like the Frazier's the Arleys, you know, the Joe Lewis is all you know, all of these people [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9104.42s)]
*  But I would say that with Tyson with early early Tyson. He was the most [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9110.220000000001s)]
*  Exciting fighter. Oh, yeah, you just the moment there was a fight with Tyson [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9116.0s)]
*  Everyone was what they were like executions [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9121.76s)]
*  Was it the knockouts you think that that was really the thing that was the threat of the knockouts the knockouts the the menacing [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9124.12s)]
*  Image that he presented would come in with a towel around his neck and nothing else [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9131.480000000001s)]
*  Black shorts [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9136.84s)]
*  Smashing people just so dedicated to this one thing being the greatest heavyweight of all time [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9138.320000000002s)]
*  And it's also as well man, like, you know [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9143.94s)]
*  You know every boxer every fighter has got a nickname and some of them are more appropriate than others [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9147.18s)]
*  He called himself the baddest man on the planet and at his peak he was the baddest man [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9152.119999999999s)]
*  There was no UFC back then [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9157.26s)]
*  You know, there was no no one could take him down [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9160.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you know you just you don't and like I said before, you know [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9163.74s)]
*  You took you you had an interview with him. You humanized him [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9168.22s)]
*  You made him you be to me he became not Mike Tyson this avatar the baddest man on the planet [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9172.02s)]
*  But what he did he became a human being and it also enriched me because then I was like [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9178.72s)]
*  Oh, I really want to do psychedelics because I want that that insight that he has had about himself [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9184.42s)]
*  Yeah, and that process I want to go on that journey now [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9190.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's helped me. Yeah helped me tremendously. Well speaking of the UFC Joe [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9194.58s)]
*  I [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9199.2s)]
*  Am so gutted that we're not gonna see John Jones versus Francis and Ghana. We might still see it. You think we will [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9200.72s)]
*  Anything can happen. You never know. We never know but that is that's got to be the greatest fight that hasn't happened in the UFC history [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9207.28s)]
*  Right. Yeah [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9214.0s)]
*  That's the big one. That would have been the big one. But you know, Francis is gonna have this boxing match with Tyson Fury [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9215.36s)]
*  Yeah, what do you think that goes? Yeah, I [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9221.56s)]
*  Mean Tyson Fury's one of the greatest if not the greatest heavyweight of all time [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9224.56s)]
*  He's so good. He's so slick his footwork his movement the way sets traps and catches people [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9228.8s)]
*  He's so clever. He's so skilled [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9236.4s)]
*  He's been unstoppable as a heavyweight boxer. Hmm. Francis is a big powerful knockout artist. That's undeniable [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9239.24s)]
*  But you know the advantage obviously goes to Tyson Fury. It's his sport [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9245.56s)]
*  He's the best one of the best if not the best ever at his sport [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9250.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he's so fucking good and he's so clever comes it all fat and everything and makes fun of it and takes his shirt off [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9254.12s)]
*  And and still beats the shit out of everybody and he's skilled isn't he? [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9259.960000000001s)]
*  So skilled he's skilled like a smaller man and he's enormous. He's so [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9264.36s)]
*  Fleed on his feet his footwork his movements. He's such a good boxer man. He's such a good boxer that you get [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9270.640000000001s)]
*  You know Francis has got to catch him with a big punch and he's got to be able to figure out how to do that [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9278.52s)]
*  Like how do you catch a guy who's been boxing his whole life against all the the greats in boxing? [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9283.76s)]
*  Guys are the best boxers ever [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9290.6s)]
*  That's it [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9293.52s)]
*  Francis I believe if when he was a young man if he had just gotten into boxing and not in MMA [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9294.960000000001s)]
*  Like if someone had found him when he was like Mike Tyson's age when Mike Tyson was 13 and trained [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9300.94s)]
*  Francis like if custom on would found Francis [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9305.4s)]
*  Francis is a terrifying specimen. He's so big and he's so powerful [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9308.06s)]
*  He's the the greatest one punch knockout artists [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9312.78s)]
*  I've ever seen the heavyweight division the stuff that he does the way he takes people out the way he knocked out Alistair [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9315.46s)]
*  Over him and Cain Velasquez and all it's just like he hits you you're fucked [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9320.36s)]
*  You're but that's with little gloves, right? Yes. You have to take into account. The gloves are bigger [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9324.82s)]
*  You got to take into account. It's only boxing [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9328.94s)]
*  So the the footwork and the movement is gonna be different and he's fighting a master [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9331.44s)]
*  You know if he can connect who fucking knows, you know, it is the quintessential punchers chance [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9335.140000000001s)]
*  But you would have to if you look at the betting odds [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9341.26s)]
*  They must be an enormously enticing furious favorite. I can't what are the betting odds online for this fight? [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9343.94s)]
*  Let's take a guess. I mean five to one six to one seven to one something like that. Maybe more [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9349.62s)]
*  Let's take a guess. What do you think there? [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9354.82s)]
*  I mean the thing is with Tyson as well is that he comes from a gypsy background and as someone who has taught gypsy kids [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9356.380000000001s)]
*  They get taught how to box from the age of four to five [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9362.6s)]
*  It's part of their culture and their other part I remember when he got he [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9367.52s)]
*  Remember which fight I was working at a radio station at the time and we were doing overnight [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9372.36s)]
*  So I watched I think it was the first wilder fight may have been the second [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9376.6s)]
*  Do you remember when he got knocked down? [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9380.0s)]
*  Everyone went to his day and then he got back up and then one I can't believe he got back up [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9381.24s)]
*  Gypsy boys are trained you never ever back down from a fight [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9385.800000000001s)]
*  You keep going until they are done or you were done. That is it. He didn't just get up [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9390.36s)]
*  He got up and won the rest of the round [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9395.720000000001s)]
*  He got up like the undertaker and then won the rest of the round and then it figured out [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9398.16s)]
*  That's the way to fight Deontay Wilder to put him on his heels [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9402.560000000001s)]
*  And then yeah came in the second fight and beat him down [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9405.04s)]
*  And then the third fight got clipped in the third fight by a punch that probably takes out [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9407.52s)]
*  99.9 [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9412.12s)]
*  9 percent of all the people who've ever lived and somehow or another he survives it from a guy who's the biggest one-punch [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9413.28s)]
*  Knockout artists in the history of boxing Deontay Wilder puts everyone to sleep [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9419.04s)]
*  Yeah, he just shuts dudes lights off with one shot blap. He does it to everybody everybody you see guys get hit [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9423.8s)]
*  They're like what the fuck happened [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9430.62s)]
*  He's such a brutal puncher and fury survived that survived that in the first fight [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9433.24s)]
*  Survived in the second fight survived in the third fight [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9438.72s)]
*  Well, this is what I was gonna ask you because if it's a punch his chance the question is [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9441.359999999999s)]
*  How does [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9445.8s)]
*  Nganu compare power wise to it like a Deontay Wilder? [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9447.24s)]
*  We really won't know we really won't know until we see him hit a boxer with the big gloves on [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9450.64s)]
*  We know Deontay Deontay hits anybody they go out except Tyson Fury's the only one has been able to survive it [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9455.48s)]
*  Because then that fight you could see with the wilder walk away. He thought he was he thought fury was done [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9461.68s)]
*  He's done when he hits him like that. Yeah, the Luis Ortiz fight. You ever see that fight? [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9467.320000000002s)]
*  No, he hit some of the right hand on the forehead [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9471.34s)]
*  Just blap and Ortiz is on the ground like like he got shot like he has no idea what the fuck [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9473.720000000001s)]
*  I watch it here find that Deontay Wilder knocks out Luis Ortiz and Luis Ortiz is from the Cuban [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9478.800000000001s)]
*  Olympic program Luis Ortiz a phenomenal boxer [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9485.68s)]
*  I think Ortiz is probably ahead on the scorecards because Ortiz is a great boxer probably close [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9488.86s)]
*  But he might have been ahead on the scorecards and Deontay just blap one shot the way knocks people out too. It's just like [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9495.72s)]
*  They go flying things got magic in his hands. He's not the biggest guy in the world [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9504.32s)]
*  He's very tall and long [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9508.519999999999s)]
*  But it's just the torque and the fucking the speed and power behind his shots [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9509.64s)]
*  It's like nobody in the history of the division even Tyson Tyson knock guys out with a barrage of punches [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9515.4s)]
*  Except like Michael Spinks and you know, I mean even Larry Holmes he'd drop Larry before he knocked him out [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9521.0s)]
*  Deontay just catches guys with one shot [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9527.26s)]
*  So they're boxing here and watch when the one punch knockout comes so he's already got him hurt yeah boom boom [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9531.8s)]
*  Is that after he's dropped or was he dropped before that [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9544.72s)]
*  No, I think he gets up I [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9548.6s)]
*  Think the rational thing to do this to stay down [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9553.960000000001s)]
*  Just the power this dude has it's just so crazy [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9558.92s)]
*  You know the one that gives me nightmares second time they fought Jamie [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9571.16s)]
*  That was the right KO yeah, I think they fought twice Matt typed in KO and those that those were the two fights that pop [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9575.4s)]
*  Dude whoo crazy [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9582.720000000001s)]
*  The Brazil fight crazy power. I mean his power is just that's round one of 12 [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9585.12s)]
*  I mean Deontay is like nobody else. He his fucking power is so ridiculous [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9591.08s)]
*  And he's so long [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9597.44s)]
*  Yeah, that was wild [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9600.6s)]
*  Stevern was the first guy to ever go the distance with him. I think in the first fight in the second fight [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9603.32s)]
*  He just put his life cheese. I [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9607.44s)]
*  Mean power is just extraordinary man. Look at that [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9609.800000000001s)]
*  He's like, you know, so [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9614.28s)]
*  Ken Francis punch like that. I don't you know, we're gonna find out [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9616.720000000001s)]
*  Be I don't know, you know, I mean it's like when you look at him move and you'll get Tyson Fury move like wow [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9620.800000000001s)]
*  That's an uphill battle. Yeah, but what is the odds? Yeah, I was gonna go 10 to 1 Joe [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9626.06s)]
*  It's I found two two different sites. It's uh, if you in Ghana's plus 725 [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9632.6s)]
*  7 to 1 yeah, you were right. Yeah, and that's you know, it probably will go up and the fight comes [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9639.36s)]
*  You know more people start betting on Tyson Fury. Yeah, this one has in Ghana just a little bit lower, but [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9646.4s)]
*  But John Jones man [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9656.76s)]
*  I would so love to see that fight particularly when we saw what happened with Cyril Gaunt because you look at Cyril Gaunt [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9657.98s)]
*  You go this guy moves so well for a big guy so skilled so talented and it was it was over [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9662.48s)]

*  Can he deliver it on someone's chin because Deontay doesn't just hit that hard [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9737.92s)]
*  He delivers those shots on guys like Tyson Fury, you know, he delivers those shots on everybody [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9741.4s)]
*  You know, it's a it's an uphill battle. He's a scary guy though. Man. Yeah, Francis is a scary dude. He's big [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9747.359999999999s)]
*  He's [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9753.92s)]
*  265 naturally shredded. So what is it? What he said? He was walking around 275 [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9755.119999999999s)]
*  275 ish 280 [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9760.839999999998s)]
*  He's walking around because he doesn't have to make the UFC's weight limit. He off sees weight limit was 265 [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9762.599999999999s)]
*  So he had to be 265 to fight in the UFC. He looks like he was chiseled out of granite [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9767.88s)]
*  he's a perfect athlete for fighting tall big long crazy power and [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9772.279999999999s)]
*  Intelligent he figures out how to get better [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9777.279999999999s)]
*  You know, he got so much better from the first DBA fight to the second. Oh, yeah, there's no comparison [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9778.88s)]
*  It's a completely different guy patient calculated [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9783.72s)]
*  Technical, you know and the the knockout punch that he hits deep [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9786.92s)]
*  The [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9791.439999999999s)]

*  Yeah, I'm a fan of guys like Francis making a shitload of money [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9812.199999999999s)]

*  I'm a fan of these kind of opportunities for fighters like for a guy like [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9829.86s)]
*  Connor McGregor when he fought Floyd Mayweather, you know, what made a hundred million dollars [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9834.3s)]
*  I'm a fan of that [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9839.06s)]
*  Yeah [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9840.1s)]

*  This isn't my argument, but it is the purest argument that [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9844.74s)]
*  Some these crossover fights are you know demeaning to the noble art of boxing, you know, the boxing is [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9849.3s)]
*  It's a sport. It's an art form, you know [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9856.46s)]
*  It's it's taking away from fighters who have dedicated their whole lives to this noble art [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9858.82s)]
*  You know what I mean that that argument? Yeah [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9863.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's yeah, but also it's fun [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9870.38s)]
*  It's fun. It's fun. The fact that the heavyweight champion the UFC who [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9873.94s)]
*  Retired as a heavyweight or left left the UFC as a champion is gonna get to box the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time with zero [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9879.46s)]
*  professional boxing fights [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9886.18s)]
*  Let's say I mean it's kind of like the Conor McGregor fight [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9890.66s)]
*  Let's see, you know and real similar in the the talent that they're facing [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9894.58s)]
*  You know when Conor McGregor fought Floyd Mayweather Floyd Mayweather's [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9899.58s)]
*  Arguably the best boxer of all time [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9903.38s)]
*  Yeah, most defensively sound boxer in the history of the sport like the guy literally has only been hit hard like three or four times [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9905.539999999999s)]
*  His whole career. I mean especially when when he really became like the great Floyd Mayweather [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9911.82s)]
*  Like he was just outboxing everybody Canelo Alvarez Manny Pacquiao. Everybody got it. Everybody got it. Ricky Hatton. Everybody [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9917.619999999999s)]
*  He beat the fuck out of everybody. He's the man the Floyd's the man like 50, you know, that's the guy [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9925.22s)]
*  I mean if you if you're gonna have an all-time great [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9931.3s)]
*  It's hard to argue that it's not that guy [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9933.9s)]
*  Because he's the guy that got away from the sport with the least amount of damage the most amount of money and [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9936.3s)]
*  He's also been able to sustain himself doing these exhibition fights for crazy amounts of money where the people literally have no chance [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9941.779999999999s)]
*  Literally have no chance and in these boxing these folks and they'll fly him over to Japan [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9949.179999999998s)]
*  You know when he had that fight over there with this kickboxer [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9953.939999999999s)]
*  he it's what he's doing is pretty wild and [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9959.14s)]
*  And you know what Francis and Gano and Tyson few are gonna do that's pretty wild too. Yeah, I mean you have to watch that [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9961.94s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Are you happy? It's happening though. Yes noble art of boxing shit. Shut the fuck up [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9968.94s)]
*  That sports completely corrupt yeah [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9976.78s)]
*  You're absolutely right. I sometimes think that the reason Mayweather doesn't get his dues is because he ain't that likeable as an individual [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9979.78s)]
*  I think it was also less exciting than you know [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9988.1s)]
*  Mike Tyson type of thing in terms of watching as a spectator [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9991.939999999999s)]
*  It's both of those things are fair to say you know [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9994.859999999999s)]
*  But also that's also how he got people to watch he got people to watch by rooting against him [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=9997.38s)]
*  Yes, you know he he you know when he first started out. He was pretty boy Floyd [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10001.779999999999s)]
*  It's a different Mayweather. You know, he's pretty boy Floyd and then he became money Mayweather [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10006.5s)]
*  Money Mayweather that's when like more people started watching and the more shitty talked and the more he showed you his diamond [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10011.9s)]
*  Crusted watches and Rolls Royces and the more people wanted him to lose the more he kept winning. Yeah, it became the heel [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10018.02s)]
*  Amazing smart. Yeah, super smart in terms of marketing [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10024.66s)]
*  I mean come on man, it ensured a large audience of people that were tuning in just to watch him lose [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10028.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well you want us you want to see if that winning streak is gonna get broken, right? [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10033.78s)]
*  Or but you also want to see someone to beat him because it's so cocky. Yeah, I'm tired of this cocky champion [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10037.74s)]
*  Whenever there's a cocky champion people like want to see him [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10043.220000000001s)]
*  This good knock him off his high horse so people will tune in just to see that yeah genius [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10046.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but it was interesting you said you still think John Jones versus Francis and going it could happen. It could happen. Yeah [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10051.9s)]
*  Why do you say that Joe? Well because Francis has his contract with the PFL [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10058.1s)]
*  Let's say he fights out his contract would say fights Tyson Fury [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10062.779999999999s)]
*  And then he fights out his contract and then at the end of the contract the UFC offers him a giant chunk of money [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10065.9s)]
*  To fight John Jones. So let's say if John Jones fights steep a [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10070.699999999999s)]
*  Who knows who wins that fight right and then maybe if he wins John Jones fight Sergei Sergei Pavlovich [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10075.44s)]
*  Who's a very scary guy who's coming through the ranks? [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10082.68s)]
*  There's not a lot of really Tom Aspin all is very promising. He's really good British guy [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10086.4s)]
*  He's really fucking good. Tom Aspin all is really good [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10092.52s)]
*  He has a potential to be an all-time great you watch Tom Aspin all's movement for a heavyweight his diversity in his skill set [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10095.4s)]
*  Leg kicks missions. He's fucking super intelligent fast as fuck. He's big naturally big guy [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10102.140000000001s)]
*  Super dedicated to the game Tom Aspin all has a real shot. So maybe it's Tom Aspin all so may in [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10109.060000000001s)]
*  depending if but if John Jones wins all those and [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10115.220000000001s)]
*  Francis wins in the PFL and then leaves and then they could have another fight and that would be bonkers [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10118.02s)]
*  That would be bonkers [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10125.5s)]
*  You want to see that man, oh, yeah [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10127.18s)]
*  Well, I want to say I was very upset that he was leaving the UFC because I wanted to see that fight [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10129.039999999999s)]
*  But also very happy that he's gonna get this giant payday. I don't know how much money they say he's gonna make [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10132.92s)]
*  Are they saying? [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10138.58s)]
*  I've seen his because for sorry Tyson signed that other site our fight against you sick that he's gonna make over a hundred million [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10140.58s)]

*  Wow talk about a cocky champion, huh? Hey, man, that's the gypsy king, you know, it's his prerogative. He's the fucking king 100% [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10157.94s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's also a fight that I really really wanted to see the music fight sports Illustrated says minimum of 10 [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10165.34s)]
*  But that's you know, yeah, not sure how I could that is [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10171.539999999999s)]
*  Is that saying that it's the bigger payout than the entire person that he's totaled from UFC? [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10174.619999999999s)]
*  Click on the link sports Illustrated receive entire [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10181.3s)]
*  UFC career whoa for Tyson Fury boxing man, that makes sense for him. You can see you can see that [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10185.82s)]
*  Yeah, he's such you know, John Jones to me [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10190.66s)]
*  It's such a fascinating character because when I watch your interview with him and he talked about contrition and wanting to be a better man [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10194.06s)]
*  I'm like I believed him every second of the way and then you look at his behavior afterwards and he's still just as wild [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10200.32s)]
*  Just as crazy. You don't get a guy who's that good without him being a wild motherfucker [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10207.22s)]
*  John's wild he's wild inside the ring. He's wild in his belief in himself. He's a wild fella [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10213.22s)]
*  I mean that dude opened up his fight against Mauricio Shogun who with a flying knee at 22 years old against a legend [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10219.74s)]
*  Catches him with a flying knee just beats the brakes off of a legend at 22 years old and wins the title. He's a [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10228.42s)]
*  extraordinary talent just [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10235.3s)]
*  extraordinarily good comes from [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10237.46s)]
*  Those whole family super athletes both of both of his brothers playing the NFL. Mm-hmm. They're both killers [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10239.779999999999s)]
*  it's just like that guy's the man, you know and [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10246.3s)]
*  that fight against him him against Francis him coming up from light heavyweight and [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10250.099999999999s)]
*  Francis being this enormous like terrifying force at heavyweight who fucking knows what oh man [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10255.099999999999s)]
*  I would so love to see that fight. I hope it happens man. I really really hope it's not one of those things where we always go [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10261.9s)]
*  Oh [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10267.54s)]
*  You know what would be and boxing is really bad for this and this part is what may maybe fall out a love of boxing [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10269.78s)]
*  for a bit which is [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10277.820000000002s)]
*  When the fight does happen, they're both past their peak. They're not the same fighters. Do you know what I mean? Eventually [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10279.94s)]
*  I don't want it to be that either right like Manny Pacquiao [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10286.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah, to me that was one of the biggest disappointments in sport. Unfortunately Manny went into that fight injured [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10289.62s)]
*  Yeah, Manny had a torn shoulder [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10294.96s)]
*  Going up to that fight unfortunately, but Floyd was very clever and when he chose that fight [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10298.24s)]
*  He chose that fight after Manny got knocked out by one man on Marquez [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10303.199999999999s)]
*  You know remember that one punch crazy knockout where it was really bad where Freddy Roach said I don't want you to do anything [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10307.679999999998s)]
*  For a year like no fighting for a year [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10313.919999999998s)]
*  And so you got to recover from this one. Remember that knockout. I don't actually what Google one Manuel Marquez [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10316.64s)]
*  Knocks out Manny Pacquiao because they had fought some really close fights and I think [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10323.359999999999s)]
*  Well, I think Manny won them. I don't know [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10329.439999999999s)]
*  What was one to draw? I don't forget. I forget what the [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10334.0s)]
*  Previous fights were but I think this was the third fight and Manny Pacquiao [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10337.519999999999s)]
*  Got clip right here. Watch this the perfect right hand. Oh [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10342.56s)]
*  He's coming in as well as he gets it perfect timing perfect one punch KO [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10347.759999999998s)]
*  out cold and [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10352.84s)]
*  This was the I think this was the end of their trilogy. Oh, it's four. This is the fourth fight they had [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10354.6s)]
*  Oh my god, I mean that is literally the perfect punch and Manny just went out cold with one shot [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10359.2s)]
*  And did you listen to Freddy Roach? Did he take a year? Yes, he did. Yes. He did [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10364.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think gave me a little well, but when there's a knockout like that is so bad like you have to [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10369.32s)]
*  That's a one punch [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10375.28s)]
*  completely unconscious massive concussion [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10377.640000000001s)]
*  And that's a massive knockout that's a rare knockout at that level, you know when you're watching guys [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10380.859999999999s)]
*  They're that good get you know [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10386.34s)]
*  There's there's some fights in the past. You could see a guy gets knocked out with one punch like that [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10388.619999999999s)]
*  Tommy Hearns versus Roberto Duran. That's one like that [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10392.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10395.5s)]
*  We're Tommy Hearns had Roberto Duran in trouble and then clipped him with the perfect right hand Roberto Duran [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10395.84s)]
*  Face plants and when you watch him Roberto Duran face plant, it's like what it's hard to believe the guy who beat Chigaray [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10401.9s)]
*  Leonard like one of the greatest boxers of all time and Tommy just catches him with a perfect right hand [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10409.08s)]
*  That's the thing with those with those guys man the power they unleash one of my my dad used to [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10415.88s)]
*  Drink with a guy called Alan Minter who was a former middleweight champion the world British guy and he fought and this was in [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10420.84s)]
*  The late 70s early 80s. I think he fought he was world champion [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10426.56s)]
*  He fought Hagler and he told my dad he goes you have never when he when he hit me [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10429.76s)]
*  I've never felt anything like that [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10434.8s)]
*  I was a monster. Yeah, he was a destroyer. Yeah, he really was [[02:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10436.92s)]
*  He was like one of the first really elite fighters that fought so well from both stances whether it's Southpaw or orthodox [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10440.84s)]
*  He could fight you from either stance. Yeah, he could you know, and he he fucked guys up like that [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10447.4s)]
*  Because he switched stances and be just as good [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10451.759999999998s)]
*  So you're looking at two different looks like the jab coming from the right hand the jab coming from the left hand [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10453.56s)]
*  You have to adjust and maybe you only stand one way and he can he can fucking switch it up anytime he wants [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10457.92s)]
*  He's unstoppable and he only got knocked down one time in his whole career and it was bullshit [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10464.08s)]
*  He got knocked down by one roll Dan. It wasn't real knockout knockdown rather. They called it a knockdown [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10468.2s)]
*  But he really just got knocked off balance and they called it a knockdown [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10473.84s)]
*  He fell down where he got clubbed in the back of the head and he went down and his gloves touched the ground [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10476.880000000001s)]
*  They called it a knockout a knockdown rather and he got up [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10480.76s)]
*  He's like what the fuck and he went out to knockout roll down but [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10483.12s)]
*  Speaking of British guys Joe patty the body versus Tony Ferguson [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10488.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's good. It's a good fight in terms of like, you know, Tony Ferguson's been on [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10492.6s)]
*  An unsuccessful streak and Patty the bad. He had that controversial fight with Jared Gordon [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10499.12s)]
*  It's a good fight [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10504.960000000001s)]
*  It's a good fight for for both guys cuz like, you know, Patty's the guy coming up and Tony is the legend [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10505.84s)]
*  And so it's a real crossroads fight and for Tony [[02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10511.62s)]
*  It may very well be his last fight in the UFC if he loses [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10515.04s)]
*  That's that's you know fair to speculate a lot of people have been calling for him to step down to stop fighting [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10518.1s)]
*  Yeah, his last few fights haven't gone that well. Well, it was really started out with him hurting his knee [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10524.38s)]
*  Yeah, you know and then he came back after that and beat Pettis which was pretty extraordinary [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10529.1s)]
*  But then when he had that gauchy fight, the gauchy fight was rough [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10534.76s)]
*  Yeah, it was rough painful to watch as well. And I love Tony Ferguson [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10538.019999999999s)]
*  I think the fact that Khabib never happened that was [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10541.539999999999s)]
*  That was [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10544.06s)]
*  That was one of the all-time bummers when he tore his knee backstage just tripping on a wire [[02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10546.1s)]
*  just fucking some [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10551.619999999999s)]
*  Unforeseen accident guy gets through an entire training camp. No problems trips on a fucking wire and rips his knee crazy needs surgery [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10554.58s)]
*  Just nuts, but in terms of baddie, do you think you bet on the young guy coming up? Oh, who knows man? [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10563.1s)]
*  Tony still has a lot in the tank. He looked good, you know in his last fight against [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10569.619999999999s)]
*  To get against Bobby Green Bobby Green is just so fast such a good striker so unorthodox [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10574.3s)]
*  You know, I think Tony still has something left, you know [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10580.1s)]
*  Whether he's got enough to beat a guy like that. That's what makes it exciting because it's a good challenge for Patty [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10583.699999999999s)]
*  It's a good fight for Tony in terms of you know [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10589.539999999999s)]
*  Where he stands because you know, Patty hasn't fought like the elite of the elite that division yet [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10593.06s)]
*  You know the gamerats the you know, the these guys that are you know challenging soon [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10598.279999999999s)]
*  for a world title because there's a few of these guys out there that are just like [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10604.18s)]
*  Super high-level guys and Patty's like, you know, he's making his way up towards those guys and this is a big step [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10608.22s)]
*  Well fizzy of that will happen against gamma. I was so disappointed such a bummer man because fizzy is so good [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10613.699999999999s)]
*  He's such a good striker [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10619.74s)]
*  That's that that was one of the most impressive Justin Gaethje performances that he outstruck fizzy [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10621.58s)]
*  You know that was that was a really impressive performance and then the dust the dust employee fight was incredible [[02:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10626.859999999999s)]
*  The fact that happened in Salt Lake City and it's a mirror image of the Leon Edwards Camaro Usman knockout in Salt Lake City [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10632.699999999999s)]
*  crazy head kick knockouts in the world title just [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10639.9s)]
*  That Leon Edwards fight was so crazy. I almost turned it off towards the end because I was all this is over, you know [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10644.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the greatest call in the history of sports John Anik says that is not the cloth from which he is cut and then boom [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10651.179999999998s)]
*  He lands that head kick because they were talking about him like phoning it in from now [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10656.619999999999s)]
*  Just just trying to survive and accepting his defeat [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10660.560000000001s)]
*  John Anik says that and then he lands a perfect head kick right afterwards was bananas [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10663.92s)]
*  He doesn't really get the credit that he deserves Lee Anna. Oh Leon Edwards. Yeah. No Leon Edwards is I think he's getting it now [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10668.04s)]
*  I think the Camaro Usman rematch just showed you know that Camaro, you know was very cautious about engaging [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10674.5s)]
*  It's like a different fight than the first fight. Also his takedown defense is on point is getting way better grappling which showed in the first [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10680.880000000001s)]
*  Camaro Usman fight because he took Camaro down which is crazy. Nobody saw that coming and mounted him. Everybody's like whoa [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10689.279999999999s)]
*  This is crazy. This is the first round of this fight. Leon's good, man [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10695.039999999999s)]
*  He's so technical. His striking is so smooth like him hitting the paths [[02:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10700.08s)]
*  He's like one of the most impressive guys I've ever seen hit the pads [[02:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10704.24s)]
*  His flow like between elbows punches and kicks. It's just everything is perfect technique [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10707.44s)]
*  Snap pop pop snap pop pop stop stop stop stop [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10713.6s)]
*  It's beautiful to watch and you add that with takedown defense and an experience and now the confidence that comes with being a champion [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10717.12s)]
*  who [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10726.04s)]
*  He's fucking good [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10727.560000000001s)]
*  How much does that change things because I think in a lot of things confidence and the knowledge that you've achieved something changes everything [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10728.560000000001s)]
*  Well, they're all very skillful at that level and everybody has a strong mind at that level, but you know like [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10735.720000000001s)]
*  Being a champion is there's a aura that comes from the champions that you have to overcome [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10742.119999999999s)]
*  Like when people fought Khabib, they weren't just fighting the champion. They weren't just fighting Khabib number gonna met off in his skills [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10748.48s)]
*  They were fighting this fucking force that they knew they were gonna face that nobody else has been able to know he's been able to do [[02:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10754.28s)]
*  Anything to him except glazed and t-bow. That was a very close fight. But other than that, like he's steamrolling everybody [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10759.44s)]
*  He's fucking everybody up and you know it and you know and you're facing this guy's [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10765.16s)]
*  Undefeated and he just seems to be getting better with every fight [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10770.12s)]
*  There's an aura of those guys that you have to overcome as well as beating them [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10772.76s)]
*  You have to overcome this aura and everybody thinks you have no chance [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10777.84s)]
*  You're going into this fucking battleground with this guy who's like the most feared warrior in your division [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10781.720000000001s)]
*  Guys been able to dominate the division like see you have to overcome that and Leon is now becoming that [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10788.04s)]
*  He's become you know, he when he beat Kamaru the second time. It was like, oh boy [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10795.24s)]
*  Okay, and then if he could be Colby Covington [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10799.76s)]
*  Whoo, that's a big one. That's an exciting fight. That's a big one. That's a big one [[03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10803.08s)]
*  Because Colby puts that fucking pressure on you. He's got an empty [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10807.76s)]
*  I mean an endless gas tank endless like an energizer bunny just doesn't start cardio so good is wrestling so good [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10812.12s)]
*  He's just constant and he just stays in your face. He just drains you he just drains people [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10818.720000000001s)]
*  Kamaru's been the only guy that's been able to figure that out [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10824.2s)]
*  There's some people have got an aura about them that [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10827.0s)]
*  It's undeniable and whatever sport it is at the moment they step onto the field or into the ring [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10830.320000000002s)]
*  There's just something about them that is undeniable. Yeah, and you just go [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10835.560000000001s)]
*  I don't know even if you don't know who the person is you imagine you immediately drawn to them. Yeah [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10839.84s)]
*  Well, that's also one of the things that's exciting about the sport [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10845.0s)]
*  Is that there there are those people that just get to this spot where they just rise above to the point where like, you know [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10848.480000000001s)]
*  Like you can't wait to watch like Volkanovsky can't wait to watch him perform again like damn he's on it right now [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10856.2s)]
*  Yeah, that guy's on it, you know Anderson Silva when he was in his prime was like that John Jones when he was the light heavyweight [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10862.84s)]
*  Champion was like that, you know, it's like damn this guy's on it [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10868.820000000002s)]
*  Like he's in that zone where like the greatness lies, you know, it's not just being the best in world [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10873.12s)]
*  But handily defeating anybody who dares challenge him. Yeah when we had done hardy on we asked [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10880.16s)]
*  And what it was like to go into the fight against George St. Pierre and I think he said something like he kind of I don't [[03:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10886.240000000002s)]
*  Remember exactly what he said, but he kind of hinted that you know, you're aware of the fact that this guy's you know at that level [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10891.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10897.740000000002s)]
*  Crazy sport man. It's the most primal. I love it. I love talk about the need for wild people [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10899.76s)]
*  That's the only way you get a sport like that. Yeah [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10905.16s)]
*  Wild people well, you know, I think in some ways the rise of the UFC obviously, you know [[03:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10908.720000000001s)]
*  Dana why and his team have done a great job and it's a fascinating sport [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10913.28s)]
*  But I think partly it's like as the culture gets [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10916.44s)]
*  Pussyfied people are crying out for something wild like that and they want to watch that. Yeah, you know in a world [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10918.92s)]
*  That's getting softer and less resilient as we talked about earlier. You want to see that shit? Yeah, there's that [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10925.199999999999s)]
*  That's why people like fights and hockey [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10931.44s)]
*  People like watching rugby and football. Yeah, they still like a little chaos some some aggressive energy [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10935.44s)]
*  Yeah, they like men being men. They're like men going to war [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10942.720000000001s)]
*  It's why like, you know when you're watching New Zealand rugby team, they're all blacks [[03:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10946.42s)]
*  They do with a hacker before they play. It's the war dogs [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10950.4s)]
*  Yeah, the rock is so awesome. Yeah, it's so awesome. Yeah. Yeah, I wonder you know what this means for [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10954.800000000001s)]
*  Our our society, you know [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10962.4s)]
*  Like the fact that these two things are happening at the same time that there is this this blowback where people do still want to watch [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10965.220000000001s)]
*  Wild crazy things. They still want to hear wild crazy things and then there's this [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10972.44s)]
*  push towards [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10977.76s)]
*  neutering of [[03:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10980.04s)]
*  Masculine energy and the term toxic male energy and you know this idea that anything masculine is inherently negative and it's [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10981.84s)]
*  It's so dangerous because if you're telling young boys that they are inherently [[03:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10990.44s)]
*  Evil and wrong and dangerous then you're essentially [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=10997.48s)]
*  alienating a very [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11003.2s)]
*  Dangerous section of society number one and number two somebody is gonna step in and go hey, you know what they think you're bad [[03:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11004.92s)]

*  Yeah, do some fucking damage and Jordan Jordan coming along was a healthy version of a response right saying to men be responsible [[03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11014.2s)]
*  Responsible take accountability go and create things go and be the strongest man at your father's funeral that that was healthy [[03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11021.48s)]
*  Now we're also getting a lot of the less healthy [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11028.56s)]

*  when you when you're saying that everything that they like and everything that they are is just [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11040.88s)]
*  Negative no matter what? [[03:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11047.199999999999s)]
*  They don't feel represented when someone comes along and challenges that even if that person is a grifter you you latch on to that [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11049.0s)]
*  Yeah [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11055.039999999999s)]
*  because when you make certain arguments beyond the pale and those arguments have merit and value and [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11055.439999999999s)]
*  But you're not allowed to say those arguments anymore. It gives them an appeal [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11061.839999999998s)]
*  It gives them an appeal number one and number two you were going to get someone from outside the mainstream coming along and going [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11065.24s)]

*  I wonder what's gonna happen with this, you know [[03:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11078.04s)]
*  There's clearly when you see what's going on with Canada with the podcast thing trying to get people to register their podcast [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11081.320000000002s)]
*  I think there's a crazy fine too for violating it was I think that fine might be something crazy like [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11088.08s)]
*  $250,000 or something. It's like a very high fine. See what the fine is for violating the rules [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11093.76s)]
*  But when you you get stuff like that [[03:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11099.68s)]
*  When you [[03:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11102.28s)]
*  It's I wonder what's gonna prevail [[03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11104.68s)]
*  What is gonna prevail is free discourse and free speech gonna prevail or are we gonna go full-combing? [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11108.800000000001s)]
*  Are we gonna go full censorship? [[03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11115.2s)]

*  They go against the narrative that the the government is trying to push like that is fucking scary [[03:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11138.199999999999s)]
*  Well, I think the thing you didn't hit the nail on the head Francis earlier when you were talking about how they're changing the concept [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11144.119999999999s)]
*  Of safety that's what we have to push back against because there's this idea if you hear opinions [[03:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11149.359999999999s)]

*  Because we've built these amazing things and they're good things to have or having a power grid is good [[03:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11404.02s)]
*  But we've got to also be smart and one of the things we're finally starting to realize at least in the UK [[03:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11408.5s)]
*  Where we went super crazy on this net zero stuff is you have to produce your own energy [[03:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11414.5s)]
*  You have to have control of that [[03:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11419.320000000002s)]
*  Otherwise, where are you buying it from? Who are you buying it from? [[03:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11421.18s)]
*  And what are they gonna do to use the fact that you're buying the energy from them against you? Yeah [[03:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11423.78s)]
*  And it's there's so many problems [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11427.86s)]
*  There's so many problems with just the way human beings acquire minerals that need to go into cell phones. Mm-hmm [[03:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11430.58s)]
*  The cobalt problem like the fact that everybody's phone has this [[03:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11438.140000000001s)]
*  Element in it that comes from people literally digging it out of the ground and mines that are working in like the most horrible conditions [[03:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11444.380000000001s)]
*  imaginable and it has been documented [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11451.380000000001s)]
*  And [[03:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11454.279999999999s)]
*  Lithium to yeah lithium to I mean a lot of the lithium that actually we need is in eastern Ukraine [[03:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11455.72s)]
*  It's one of the reasons that shit is going on [[03:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11461.32s)]
*  I think it was going to be the second biggest producer of lithium in the world after China [[03:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11463.199999999999s)]
*  You saw a conspiracy theorist [[03:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11466.76s)]
*  But yeah, we the net zero stuff actually scares me because it's it's climate change is kind of a cult in and of itself [[03:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11475.08s)]
*  Yeah, you know because that's also a thing where people aren't willing to listen at all to people with opposing viewpoints [[03:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11482.48s)]
*  And then if you do you are now a climate denier [[03:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11488.84s)]
*  Just like how if you were kind of like hey, what's going on with these mRNA vaccines? Oh, you're anti-vax like oh what? [[03:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11492.36s)]

*  Yeah, like if you are curious about whether or not all this stuff that you're offering up as a solution is actually [[03:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11502.84s)]
*  Willing is that actually gonna be effective if everybody stops eating meat how much does that change and what are you gonna do about China and [[03:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11509.8s)]
*  India and then their output and what how much CO2 is actually in the atmosphere and how much do you need in the atmosphere? [[03:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11516.119999999999s)]
*  Isn't there a certain amount you need? [[03:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11522.519999999999s)]
*  What percentage are we above what we used to be it turns out? It's like it's like [[03:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11524.279999999999s)]
*  0.04 is what we are now and we used to be point zero three and at point zero two plant life starts to die [[03:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11530.08s)]
*  Because not enough carbon dioxide. It's like what percentage of that is human beings. That's a good question and [[03:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11538.3s)]
*  What percentage of it is the rest of the world and what percentage of it are we gonna save by ruining? [[03:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11546.939999999999s)]
*  Everything here in the Western world right well so in the UK we have this obsession about net zero [[03:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11552.019999999999s)]
*  And I'm like okay, let's get our emissions down to zero [[03:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11556.619999999999s)]
*  Let's say Britain produces no carbon emissions at all and the ones that we outsource abroad [[03:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11559.259999999998s)]
*  That's 2% of global carbon emissions you just fucked our country to make no difference [[03:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11563.64s)]
*  whatsoever to the problem with a big the big polluter or the big contributor to the biggest by far is China and India [[03:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11570.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're the two biggest [[03:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11576.24s)]
*  And if they're gonna keep doing it [[03:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11578.0s)]
*  Which they are which seems like what we need to do [[03:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11580.0s)]
*  I mean this sounds very simple from a moron like myself, but it's invaded India and China. They need to figure out [[03:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11583.359999999999s)]
*  Technologies to clean the air and that doesn't seem impossible in fact there was there was some talk of a giant [[03:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11589.48s)]
*  Skyscraper that acted as an air filter and that they were gonna install remember those Jamie [[03:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11596.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, see if you find that there's talk of construction. It might have been in China [[03:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11602.44s)]
*  They were gonna build these essentially [[03:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11607.04s)]
*  Skyscrapers that were really just giant air filters and that instead of a skyscraper that it housed you know office buildings or people [[03:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11610.12s)]
*  It actually housed equipment that just sucked pollution out of the air and filtered it and you're like [[03:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11617.0s)]
*  Maybe that would maybe that's it. Maybe that would work. Maybe you could actually capture [[03:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11623.16s)]
*  There it is the skyscraper sized air purifiers the world's tallest Wow [[03:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11628.16s)]
*  So what if they just had those on every block or had those you know every you know X amount of blocks [[03:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11633.84s)]
*  Where they figured out a way to clean the air? [[03:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11640.68s)]
*  Okay, it can reduce pollution in a major metropolitan areas by 20% for example if if we can oh, I'm sorry [[03:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11643.24s)]
*  Sorry, I like to tell my students. We don't need to be medical doctors to save lives. Dr. David Pooley [[03:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11650.76s)]
*  Professor of mechanical engineering University of Minnesota and one of the one of the researchers [[03:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11655.960000000001s)]
*  So if they could just reduce air pollution by 20% for example, we could save tens of thousands of lives a year [[03:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11660.800000000001s)]
*  Okay. Yeah, so this seems like it's about air pollution [[03:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11666.08s)]
*  But your point about China and India Joe's so right because I was talking to an Indian dude [[03:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11668.72s)]
*  And he told me that the time of partition this is 1947 when India became independent [[03:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11672.599999999999s)]
*  average life expectancy in India [[03:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11677.199999999999s)]
*  Jamie fact-check me if you could please but I think it was 37 years [[03:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11679.439999999999s)]
*  Right fast forward to today. It's over 80 [[03:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11683.76s)]
*  You think those people are gonna give up burning shit to live longer you think they're gonna do that? [[03:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11686.68s)]
*  Because I don't think they will I don't think the Chinese are gonna stop making stuff and producing stuff and burning stuff [[03:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11692.439999999999s)]
*  The only the people have a say over there in China. That's true [[03:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11697.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, particularly but it's a big part of it, right? [[03:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11701.12s)]
*  Like there's not gonna be some movement against the government of policy. I've checked both net zero plan [[03:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11703.28s)]
*  Yeah to reach net zero emissions by 2060 the report estimates China needs between [[03:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11708.640000000001s)]
*  US 14 to 17 trillion in addition to investments for green infrastructure and technology and the power and transport sectors alone [[03:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11713.800000000001s)]
*  It seems like quite a lot of money to me. Yeah [[03:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11722.04s)]
*  Yeah, okay [[03:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11724.48s)]
*  So says Ji Jinping said since September of 2020 when China's president Ji Jinping made the pledge to reach net zero by [[03:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11726.119999999999s)]
*  2060 the country's ministers and locales have been mobilized devised [[03:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11734.359999999999s)]
*  Decarbonization roadmaps for their jurisdictions. Maybe they can do that [[03:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11739.0s)]
*  Maybe they can I mean maybe there's technologies that either haven't been implemented or just theoretical where they can figure out a way [[03:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11742.4s)]
*  To clean it up without destroying their economy, you know, and that might be possible [[03:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11750.56s)]
*  I don't know but it's certain that human beings are having an effect. I mean like [[03:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11755.080000000002s)]
*  Specifically with pollution and not just that not just the air [[03:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11760.2s)]
*  We certainly should be looking at carbon dioxide and certainly should be looking at humans impact [[03:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11764.04s)]
*  We'd also be looking at what the fuck we're doing in the ocean. Yeah, we're killing the ocean [[03:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11768.78s)]
*  We're filling it up with garbage and literally killing most of the species [[03:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11772.84s)]
*  We were just talking about the other day that there's they don't really know what the real numbers are [[03:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11777.1s)]
*  Estimated that we've killed somewhere in the neighborhood of like 80 to 90 percent of the fish [[03:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11782.46s)]
*  yeah, I what just scooping fish out and killing everything and [[03:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11785.779999999999s)]
*  Giant fucking country-sized [[03:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11792.9s)]
*  Floating garbage islands, you know like what? [[03:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11795.46s)]
*  In the island of the Pacific garbage patch is bigger than Texas Texas is bigger than multiple European countries [[03:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11798.939999999999s)]
*  And that patch of garbage is bigger than that [[03:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11806.14s)]
*  Yeah, you know the thing that I find really really demoralizing about this debate is the fact that the complete lack of critical thinking skills [[03:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11808.3s)]
*  People on the left therefore they think this people on the right they think this I know I'm not gonna mention this person's name [[03:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11815.74s)]
*  They came on your pod and they were like well [[03:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11820.38s)]
*  I think you know, it doesn't exist climate change and and that person thought that way [[03:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11822.22s)]
*  I think a lot of it is because they're on the right, you know [[03:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11826.46s)]
*  So they see the way the tribe moves they move with the tribe instead of actually taking every issue [[03:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11828.859999999999s)]
*  Looking at it themselves doing the reading doing the work and then going well [[03:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11834.46s)]
*  This is what I think regardless of this tribal that tribe. Yeah. Yeah, you if you're on the left [[03:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11837.859999999999s)]
*  Do you think climate change is imperative if you're on the right, you're probably more dismissive of it, you know [[03:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11843.26s)]
*  Certainly we should really look at nuclear power [[03:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11848.9s)]
*  Yeah, nuclear power seems to be the cleanest way to do this and it's safe in relative. It's safe [[03:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11851.02s)]
*  It's a how we always make this joke [[03:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11857.22s)]
*  You [[03:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11859.34s)]
*  Say that but actually if you look at the casualties from nuclear disasters, there's only been three major ones, right long Island three mile island [[03:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11860.859999999999s)]
*  Chernobyl and Fukushima if you look at the stats and you add it all up [[03:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11869.9s)]
*  It nuclear energy is safer than hydro. There's one dam collapse in China killed way more people than all the nuclear disasters put together [[03:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11874.26s)]
*  Yeah, the real issue though is it ruins that area forever? [[03:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11881.939999999999s)]
*  So like no one's moving into Chernobyl [[03:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11886.019999999999s)]
*  Fukushima's fucked. Yeah, that place is fucked like when when they do go south they go bad [[03:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11889.38s)]
*  It's the point where a friend of mine who's this brilliant guy says he won't eat fish from the Pacific anymore [[03:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11894.74s)]
*  And I said why and he said [[03:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11899.46s)]
*  Fukushima he goes I don't think they're they're testing for it. I don't think they're they're testing for radiation poisoning [[03:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11901.98s)]
*  I don't think I don't think they've measured it because he goes what if you know [[03:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11907.42s)]
*  What if it's a lot worse than we think it is and we find this out 10 15 years from now [[03:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11911.539999999999s)]
*  Maybe I'm wrong. He goes. I just don't want to take a chance. So I don't eat fish from the Pacific [[03:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11915.5s)]
*  I'm like, wow that is a fair point. Yeah, I don't know if it is [[03:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11919.220000000001s)]
*  I mean, is that ridiculous mean how much of an impact does Fukushima have on the entire mass of the Pacific Ocean? [[03:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11923.460000000001s)]
*  No, I mean your fair point about you can't live in that area for a very very very very very long time [[03:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11929.66s)]
*  Yeah, that's a fair point. Yeah, I mean hundreds of thousands years [[03:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11936.14s)]
*  Yeah, those areas are ruined [[03:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11938.78s)]
*  Yeah [[03:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11940.02s)]
*  But the thing is they can mitigate that now and they could figure out a way to have nuclear power plants with better failsafe [[03:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11940.460000000001s)]
*  Then they had in Fukushima Fukushima [[03:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11945.38s)]
*  They had like a backup and that got crushed too [[03:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11947.54s)]
*  And then they're fucked because they can't shut it off and then you have this reactor that you can't shut down [[03:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11949.7s)]
*  It's just chaos. I mean Chernobyl they had to work really hard to make that thing blow up [[03:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11954.78s)]
*  It was like incompetence and all sorts of other dynamics going on. There was pretty fucked up. What's wild now is there's things living there [[03:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11959.38s)]
*  It's like who knows what kind of crazy mutation [[03:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11966.62s)]
*  Godzilla type shit is going on there. Do you know there's a there's an animal sanctuary [[03:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11969.1s)]
*  Area in the Red Forest and it's one of the safest areas for wildlife in the world because there's no humans there [[03:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11974.900000000001s)]
*  Wow, but has anybody measured the effects of radiation on those animals? [[03:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11981.86s)]
*  I mean some of them are getting affected obviously, but they're not getting shot by humans is the point [[03:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11986.5s)]
*  Right, but what if they're developing like telepathy? [[03:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11991.220000000001s)]
*  I [[03:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11994.06s)]
*  Mean comic books radiation always leads to awesome things. That's a Spiderman exactly, you know, that's a become the Hulk or yeah X-Men [[03:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=11996.5s)]
*  Yeah, maybe that's China and maybe that's Russia's maybe that's the next stage of the war [[03:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12004.22s)]
*  Ukraine. Oh, yeah all the problems in comic books like with radiation [[03:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12009.9s)]
*  It's all like someone becomes a superhero now. They have these powers and they're yeah. Well, I guess I have to save the world [[03:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12015.18s)]
*  I [[03:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12020.74s)]
*  Realized you're just fucked. Yeah, maybe that's what we need to solve our problems. It's a spider squirrel from Chernobyl. So yeah, maybe we need aliens [[03:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12021.98s)]
*  Maybe that's what we need. Maybe they need to come down and go settle the fuck down [[03:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12029.86s)]
*  Yeah, this is maybe we just need beings who are just way smarter than us just to go [[03:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12033.94s)]
*  You are a bunch of incompetent chimps shut up and I will deal with it [[03:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12038.539999999999s)]
*  What do you think about all this UAP stuff when you see this? [[03:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12042.699999999999s)]
*  I mean, I don't like that they change it from UFO to UAP. That's annoying [[03:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12046.22s)]
*  I know what you're doing just coming up with new clever ways to make it less [[03:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12049.78s)]
*  Ridiculous to the world. But like what do you think about all this disclosure stuff? The thing that makes me skeptical is [[03:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12054.42s)]
*  UFO sightings are so disproportionately in North America [[03:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12061.1s)]
*  You guys love a conspiracy theater [[03:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12068.02s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, you know what I mean? Yeah, and it's never in New York either. You know what I mean? There's a few [[03:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12070.94s)]
*  Yeah, yeah it happens in New York there's been some but also people like [[03:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12076.68s)]
*  Like that's a problem, you know, it's like the amount of like really good footage is [[03:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12080.960000000001s)]
*  This the compelling stuff is the stuff the fighter jets capture. That's compelling like the tic-tac footage [[03:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12085.76s)]
*  That's compelling [[03:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12092.400000000001s)]
*  you know when they talk about the the amount of g-force that would be involved and something moving in that way like most things that [[03:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12093.560000000001s)]
*  We have would just fall apart like this [[03:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12100.800000000001s)]
*  What is moving that quickly is [[03:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12103.400000000001s)]
*  The is the all of the sensors of all those accurate or all those detection systems and all the radar and tracking is all that accurate [[03:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12106.400000000001s)]
*  Because if it is accurate like what the fuck can move that quick like explain that what is that and if that's ours? [[03:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12115.0s)]
*  like [[03:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12122.12s)]
*  Like if they've managed to hide some sort of super sophisticated [[03:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12123.84s)]
*  Propulsion system that's beyond our comprehension like beyond [[03:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12128.880000000001s)]
*  Nothing you could imagine and that they've been working on this for decades and that that's what all this UFO talk [[03:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12134.64s)]
*  They you mean the government. Yeah. Yeah, some black ops program some [[03:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12140.0s)]
*  Special top secret shit where they're in the middle of the desert [[03:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12144.04s)]
*  They figure out a propulsion system that works on gravity, but could they keep that secret for that long? [[03:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12148.08s)]
*  That's the thing man, you know [[03:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12153.48s)]
*  Because it's it's it's easy to go down this route and go the government are keeping things secret and of course the government do [[03:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12155.72s)]
*  And of course their cover-ups, but if there's one thing I can know from the British government [[03:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12161.76s)]
*  It's just that they can never cover anything up. You know what I mean for that incompetent. Yeah, right, but that's the [[03:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12165.6s)]
*  Legislators and the Senate the Congress what about the fucking people that are involved in the highest levels of the military? [[03:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12171.6s)]
*  I bet they keep a lot of good secrets [[03:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12177.4s)]
*  I bet they're real good at it [[03:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12179.52s)]
*  Especially people that are working with defense contractors [[03:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12181.4s)]
*  Like if they really did receive a crashed UFO and they were back engineering it [[03:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12183.64s)]
*  It would be a national security imperative for us to get that first [[03:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12188.06s)]
*  If there's some craft that came here from Alpha Centauri and they've managed to get a hold of it [[03:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12192.16s)]
*  And they're trying to figure out how that thing works [[03:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12197.84s)]
*  You better shut the fuck up until we figure this out [[03:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12199.6s)]
*  And I think that would be like if you're a patriot and you were working for the government you would you would keep your fucking mouth [[03:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12201.88s)]
*  Shut that was your job [[03:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12208.039999999999s)]
*  Also, they're what they're looking at every email you send every text message you send [[03:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12209.44s)]
*  They probably got your house bugged if you talk about it. They're gonna know yeah [[03:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12213.560000000001s)]
*  You know I think it's possible to keep secrets as much as people want to think that it's not [[03:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12217.44s)]
*  But I don't know. I don't know what the fuck is going on and I'm part of me is like [[03:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12222.2s)]
*  They're talking about it too much. You know part of me is like show me something [[03:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12227.52s)]
*  Show me something like I don't want to go [[03:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12232.36s)]
*  All this talk like even David Grush he never saw anything he just uncovered programs that he found who knows who gave him that [[03:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12235.48s)]
*  Information I mean if I wanted to fucking put out some disinformation. I would encourage someone to be a whistleblower [[03:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12242.039999999999s)]
*  That's what I would do. I would tell them some nonsense and encourage them to tell everybody else and then it discredits the whole thing [[03:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12247.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[03:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12253.16s)]
*  It makes the whole thing like preposterous or it also can cover up this other thing that you have going on you say oh [[03:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12253.439999999999s)]
*  These are off-world crafts can't be ours [[03:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12259.519999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile it is ours like one of the things that's happening [[03:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12261.92s)]
*  That's weird is they're always in these areas where the military operates like off the coast the East Coast where? [[03:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12264.720000000001s)]
*  They've seen those things is it like a cube inside a circle is that what it is [[03:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12272.640000000001s)]
*  It's either a cube inside a circle or a circle inside a cube [[03:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12277.48s)]
*  But they keep seeing these things that can hover at 120 knots completely still [[03:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12280.76s)]
*  Move off faster than the eye can see and this is something that Ryan Graves experienced [[03:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12287.04s)]
*  He didn't experienced it. He's experienced it on his sensors [[03:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12292.4s)]
*  They upgraded their sensors and I think it was 2014 and almost immediately they started spotting these things that just [[03:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12294.960000000001s)]
*  Violated everything that they knew about like the way objects could move and behave. What do you make of this argument? [[03:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12301.28s)]
*  I can't remember who's made it [[03:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12307.220000000001s)]
*  But it's the idea that if we were to encounter an alien species if they reached here [[03:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12308.300000000001s)]
*  They would be so technologically advanced that they could do whatever the fuck they wanted basically [[03:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12312.12s)]
*  Maybe or maybe there's like levels like we are at [[03:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12316.64s)]
*  right, maybe there's like if we are going to eventually travel to other planets and [[03:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12320.64s)]
*  Establish a civilization of the plants or visit other planets. How long is that? When's that gonna be? Is that a hundred years from now? [[03:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12326.08s)]
*  Is it 50? Maybe that's where they are. Maybe there's some that are a thousand years more advanced [[03:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12332.039999999999s)]
*  Maybe there's some that are millions of years [[03:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12337.800000000001s)]
*  Maybe some of them live in a solar system that's much more stable and it doesn't have the problem that we have with asteroids [[03:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12339.36s)]
*  Maybe there's you know less collisions and they're so they're allowed to reach this [[03:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12345.84s)]
*  Technological level of sophistication that's evolving over millions of years and they're like gods [[03:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12352.12s)]
*  They're there. We can't even fathom the kind of technology they have available [[03:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12358.4s)]
*  Well, we would imagine that if we keep going we're gonna hit that [[03:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12363.26s)]
*  But it is maybe as well [[03:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12366.720000000001s)]
*  They don't have the capacity for self-destruction that the human being does right? Maybe they've engineered that out [[03:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12368.12s)]
*  Maybe that's part of the feminization of males. Maybe that's part of the for real [[03:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12372.720000000001s)]
*  That's maybe that's part of all this gender chaos [[03:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12377.880000000001s)]
*  maybe [[03:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12380.68s)]
*  That's part of the micro plastics that are endocrine disruptors that are fucking pesticides and also other things that are fucking with people's [[03:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12381.92s)]
*  reproductive systems, maybe it's like a natural [[03:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12389.720000000001s)]
*  Gradual change that the species must take in order to evolve to the next stage that it has to like [[03:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12392.16s)]
*  sacrifice its lust and anger and fury and all these chimpanzee instincts that are really associated with [[03:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12400.08s)]
*  dominant male hormones and [[03:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12409.08s)]
*  Primate behavior that we see in the jungle. Yeah, but can we operate as a as a as a species without those? [[03:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12412.0s)]
*  I would argue that we can't [[03:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12419.0s)]
*  when [[03:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12421.32s)]
*  Joe's telling you who to vote for everybody [[03:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12424.68s)]
*  Takes over our benevolent overload it'll make people eat credit cards every day so that your body will develop more micro plastics and [[03:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12428.36s)]
*  Shrink your testes. Yeah, I don't know, you know, I wonder I wonder what's happening [[03:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12435.76s)]
*  You know, I think it's happening very quickly and it's hard because we're in the storm. We're in the middle of storm washing it [[03:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12440.2s)]
*  But if you look at the amount of change that's taking place in human culture just over the past 20 30 years [[03:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12446.859999999999s)]
*  It's kind of unprecedented since the emergence of the Internet. There's been never been anything like this [[03:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12453.74s)]
*  Yeah, it feels like we're living in a culture which has hit the fast-forward button [[03:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12459.14s)]
*  Mm-hmm and is out of control like we're on the roller coaster ride [[03:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12464.3s)]
*  We used to be going like this click click click click click click click click click now. We're going like this. Yeah [[03:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12467.5s)]
*  And you know, I don't know where it goes and I think part of it is that the [[03:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12474.42s)]
*  We've got to fix the outrage machine that we've got which is corporate media [[03:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12479.660000000002s)]
*  Social media the way we communicate about things about ideas. Yeah, this is why I have hope for new media [[03:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12484.380000000001s)]
*  It's we don't always get things right, of course [[03:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12490.480000000001s)]
*  But it's an opportunity to change the conversation to have more of this to have more long-form stuff to pursue the truth [[03:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12492.400000000001s)]
*  Whereas right now the incentives and Francis said earlier [[03:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12501.18s)]
*  It's a phrase I repeat all the time human beings respond to incentives and right now [[03:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12504.62s)]
*  Being outraged and being outrageous is what's rewarded and being calm being sensible being reasonable [[03:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12508.74s)]
*  Listening to other people that isn't the thing that we've been doing for the last 20 30 years [[03:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12516.26s)]
*  We've been doing the opposite of that [[03:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12520.66s)]
*  And I think we have to find a way to change the incentive structure of the Internet whereby [[03:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12522.1s)]
*  We're not incentivized to be our worst selves [[03:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12527.82s)]
*  We've got to do that if we don't do that [[03:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12531.5s)]
*  We're gonna destroy ourselves long before any fucking aliens get hit man [[03:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12533.539999999999s)]
*  And that's my worry man to go back to your metaphor about the roller coaster [[03:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12536.06s)]
*  We are on the world, but I'm gonna be honest you might I'm looking down. I'm like, is there a track? [[03:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12539.46s)]
*  No, there's never we've never experienced this before right as far as we know the human race has never experienced anything like this before [[03:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12546.419999999998s)]
*  This connectedness [[03:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12554.14s)]
*  But every informational revolution [[03:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12556.98s)]
*  I mean people have always talked about this example of the printing press [[03:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12558.859999999999s)]
*  Right, right. You have solely the church that controls all information [[03:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12562.26s)]
*  Most people are literate and then you get the printing press and you start spreading information to more people and there's more perspectives [[03:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12566.18s)]
*  And then you get two centuries of religious warfare [[03:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12572.26s)]
*  That's what I get books about witches [[03:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12577.14s)]
*  Yeah, you know that was one of the first things that people did when they started using the printing press you think oh [[03:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12578.98s)]
*  Writing all these great books about philosophy and psychology. Nope. Nope. How to spot a witch. Yeah [[03:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12584.3s)]
*  Something that we can all get behind man and it encourages our worst instincts and we'll be like, you know [[03:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12591.5s)]
*  What all the problems in the society? It's their fault. Yeah. Yeah, there's a lot of one shot thing going on right now [[03:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12596.38s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of which I mean JK Rowling is a witch like how did that happen? [[03:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12601.68s)]
*  You know what? I mean, like she was this most progressive lefty person says one thing about trans [[03:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12605.539999999999s)]
*  Boom she's a Nazi. Yeah, how did that happen? [[03:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12612.5s)]
*  You know, it's the Wild West out there and everyone just fucking went along with it [[03:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12615.78s)]
*  Like the mainstream media went along with it controversial orthodoxy. What you know, I know Hitler never went, you know [[03:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12619.98s)]
*  I'm gonna take over the world. I'm gonna write some beloved children's books [[03:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12626.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's someone [[03:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12631.7s)]
*  Violating the orthodoxy. Yeah. Yeah, you know and [[03:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12634.18s)]
*  There was part of me who thought okay now she's come out we're gonna have a modicum of sanity [[03:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12638.3s)]
*  That's what I genuinely thought when I was naive and more stupid [[03:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12642.62s)]
*  Look, we should say we are actually making progress in the UK on that issue. We really are. Yeah on the transition [[03:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12645.98s)]
*  We're making progress. You guys have shut down all those we shut down the clinic and the the rules and laws are starting to change and we're [[03:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12651.7s)]
*  Starting to be sensible. So maybe the great hope is we kind of overreached and now we're reigning it back in a little bit [[03:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12658.06s)]
*  It's not the case here from what I can tell doesn't seem to be the case here at all [[03:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12664.1s)]
*  No, I mean it's coming straight from the White House. Yeah [[03:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12668.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's terrifying man. That's it. You know [[03:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12671.74s)]
*  It's so interesting like now that our show has become bigger and people recognize us [[03:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12674.62s)]
*  I get a lot of especially gay people coming up to me to talk to me to thank me to thank me and ask for [[03:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12678.9s)]
*  What we do this this young lady came up to me. She was like she was American [[03:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12686.140000000001s)]
*  She must be in her like sort of mid to late 20s and she was like, you know [[03:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12690.140000000001s)]
*  If I was born ten years younger and you know, she's a gay woman [[03:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12694.34s)]
*  She goes I would have been screaming that house down at my parents. I would have been demanding a double mastectomy [[03:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12698.9s)]
*  I would have been demanding puberty blockers because I was so miserable and [[03:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12704.7s)]
*  Distressed and deeply unhappy at the fact that I was a gay girl [[03:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12709.7s)]
*  Yeah [[03:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12712.98s)]
*  Yeah, that's a lot of the way a lot of gay people feel about this whole movement that in some ways [[03:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12713.74s)]
*  It's kind of homophobic because it's saying you're not gay. You're just in the wrong body [[03:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12719.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and so many of them are autistic as well [[03:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12723.300000000001s)]
*  This is what we are not taking into account quite often is [[03:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12725.7s)]
*  And we've had lots of people on the show to talk about this [[03:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12728.300000000001s)]
*  A lot of these kids are autistic a lot of these people particularly the girls they would have had anorexia or bulimia before before that [[03:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12730.82s)]
*  They would have had something else [[03:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12737.14s)]
*  It's just the way of people showing distress about what it's like to be a young woman [[03:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12738.220000000001s)]
*  It's not exactly a great, you know a great time to be a young woman when it comes to body image when it comes to [[03:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12741.9s)]
*  The perception and the reality of how men and women relate in our society and all of that, right? [[03:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12748.18s)]
*  And a lot of the young men there what's happening is they're being praised for this choice [[03:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12754.1s)]
*  Yeah, there's there's social credit to being you know identifying in a different way. Yeah. Yeah, and it's it's it's really sad, man [[03:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12759.58s)]
*  It's really because it affects everything [[03:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12769.02s)]
*  I was doing a gig a few weeks ago and there was a comic on the bull and older gay guy and [[03:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12770.539999999999s)]
*  Like, you know the classic look over the shoulder both ways and he sat down started talking to me [[03:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12775.1s)]
*  And this is a guy whose partner's experienced the AIDS pandemic saw a lot of his friends die [[03:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12779.220000000001s)]
*  His partner was basically given a flat near to the hospital because at that stage of the [[03:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12785.54s)]
*  In the 80s and the 90s. It was like look you've got this virus [[03:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12791.26s)]
*  You're gonna die [[03:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12794.86s)]
*  So have a have a flat near to the hospital where you can get treatment and then when you die [[03:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12795.74s)]
*  At least you'll be comfortable and he looked to me and he was talking about everything that was going on [[03:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12799.74s)]
*  Going to pride marches. He was like, it's a really bad time to be gay [[03:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12804.86s)]
*  he went I went to Manchester Pride and [[03:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12808.58s)]
*  This woman got up on stage and she [[03:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12811.140000000001s)]
*  Brought her six-year-old daughter with her held her up to the crowd and went. This is my daughter [[03:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12814.82s)]
*  She's a little gay girl and the entire crowd cheered and he and he went I was just there going you're sexualizing your daughter [[03:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12819.66s)]
*  What are you doing? Right? You're seeing your six-year-old attracted to women [[03:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12827.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and then and then people are cheering and going this is great and he's like no, it's not [[03:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12831.380000000001s)]
*  You know Brett said something to me when I had my son. He said congratulations. Your heart is now outside of your body [[03:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12836.34s)]
*  And [[03:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12843.58s)]
*  That is to me the great hope on some of these issues is like people's love for their children is such a powerful force [[03:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12845.22s)]
*  And it can be a force for good too [[03:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12851.22s)]
*  and we've seen a lot of feminists stand up on this stuff in the UK and a lot of parents as well because [[03:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12852.7s)]
*  You know what? It's like and you're a father of girls, right? [[03:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12858.66s)]
*  Like this you it's it's now many people's one of their greatest nightmares about what could happen to their children, you know [[03:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12861.34s)]
*  So that if your children get indoctrinated into something like this and make some change to their life that is permanent and [[03:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12869.74s)]
*  That people are encouraging them to do that a pre preteen [[03:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12877.94s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's it's crazy and it's something that we've always known that children [[03:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12882.02s)]
*  Don't have the ability to see the future. Yeah, you don't like that's why you don't allow them to get tattooed [[03:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12888.32s)]
*  That's why you know [[03:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12893.2s)]
*  It's like but with this they're like no no no, they know [[03:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12894.8s)]
*  Yeah, and it's and the fact that it's become so party political here is I think why you're not making as much progress in America [[03:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12899.12s)]
*  On this issue because it's like you're on the right you're against you're on the left you're for [[03:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12905.44s)]
*  Why don't we just look at what is medically correct? What is good? What is bad? What damages people what helps people? [[03:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12909.48s)]
*  Let's take some fucking time. No people don't even want to look at the side effects of some of these [[03:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12916.36s)]
*  Medications are giving kids because it's too painful job. They're sterilizing they are ruining their bodies [[03:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12921.56s)]
*  Permanently it reduces their life expectancy [[03:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12928.72s)]
*  I mean Chloe Cole and there's lots of other D transition as you listen to their testimony and the scary thing is the D [[03:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12931.119999999999s)]
*  Transitioners get attacked. Yeah, they talk about their own personal experiences and the regret of transitioning and they get attacked [[03:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12936.84s)]
*  Yeah, because you know, they're somehow got internalized transphobia now and it's it you I just I [[03:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12943.080000000002s)]
*  Really hope that we just wake up from this that we wake up from this and that's the thing [[03:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12949.720000000001s)]
*  That's great about the UK is that we do have left-wing politicians like Rosie Duffield who have come out and spoken about this [[03:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12955.480000000001s)]
*  Honestly, and she's a hero. She's an absolute hero because she has been called all manner of names by her own party [[03:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12962.92s)]
*  She's been attacked yet. She has stood firm. What a hero. Well, I hope people wake up here, too [[03:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12969.68s)]
*  Yeah, what how do you think that happens? I guess just talking about it [[03:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12974.88s)]
*  I guess the discussion moving from being orthodoxy that you can't question to people seeing [[03:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12978.92s)]
*  D-transitioners seeing problems with that [[03:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12986.84s)]
*  we know with children being malleable and easily influenced and seeing [[03:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12989.08s)]
*  people that might just be a feminine man that might be gay and you're turning them into a woman and [[03:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12993.359999999999s)]
*  forcing them to get castrated and [[03:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=12999.12s)]
*  Yeah this idea that you know, you're not a man if you don't like, you know [[03:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=13003.6s)]
*  You know climbing trees and cutting down logs and all of this nonsense. It's just so backwards [[03:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=13007.800000000001s)]
*  I thought we'd overcome that I thought you could be a feminine guy who loved writing poetry and was more [[03:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=13013.68s)]
*  Sensitive and that was great. And that's just another type of man [[03:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=13020.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I used to be [[03:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHqQ15zXFQ&t=13025.28s)]
