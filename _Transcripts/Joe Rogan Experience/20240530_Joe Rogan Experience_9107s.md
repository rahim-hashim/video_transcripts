# Joe Rogan Experience #2158 - Harland Williams
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCGCu_v77Do)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Showing my day, Joe Rogan podcast, my night, all day.
*  Oh boy, I think I've known you for 30 years. You know how crazy that is?
*  31.
*  Is it really?
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  I remember the day we met.
*  Really?
*  Baskin Robbins on Melrose.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Do we meet at Baskin Robbins?
*  Baskin Robbins. I got one of those memories like the girl from Taxi.
*  Oh, do you really?
*  He got a mint chocolate chip, double scoop, and I had peanut butter and chocolate.
*  I think you're making this up.
*  Well.
*  I think you're making this up. He's making this up.
*  I was like, hold on, let's see how this goes.
*  Yeah, as soon as he was saying he's got a memory like the lady from Taxi, I was like,
*  And I couldn't even remember her name.
*  That lady's got a crazy memory.
*  She does.
*  She can tell you like dates in 1972, what day it was.
*  Dude, I bumped into her at a sushi joint once and she reenacted the day I lost my virginity.
*  It's unbelievable.
*  Wow.
*  She remembered it.
*  How does she know?
*  Do you think she's an alien?
*  No, it was her.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah.
*  She popped my cherry.
*  She was hot back in the day.
*  She drove my Taxi.
*  Ooh.
*  Yeah.
*  She acted as your depot.
*  Wait, what's her name?
*  Mary Lou Retina?
*  No.
*  What is it?
*  It's close.
*  Mary Lou Iris?
*  No.
*  Cornea.
*  Cornea.
*  Mary Lou Cornea.
*  What was her name?
*  Retina.
*  Retina?
*  No, that's the gymnast.
*  She's the gymnast.
*  That's the gymnast.
*  What was her name?
*  Is it Marlee Matlin?
*  That's the deaf chick.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the one that everybody had to pretend was really good at acting.
*  But she did win an Oscar, didn't she?
*  Mary Lou Henner.
*  Oh, she did the tampon commercials.
*  Did she?
*  Yeah.
*  And who better to do them than a Tumblr?
*  They get guys to do them now.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a new world.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, there she is.
*  Back in the day when she was on Taxi, she was hot.
*  But you can't ever lie to her.
*  Yeah, she knows everything.
*  You didn't even, you're like, I didn't say that.
*  Like, not only did you say that, you were wearing this.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, she just knows it all.
*  Yeah.
*  Unbelievable.
*  That's probably a real issue in relationships.
*  Yeah.
*  You can never argue with her about who was right.
*  She remembers it.
*  Yeah.
*  100%.
*  You got a foggy ass bullshit normal human.
*  How good's your memory?
*  My memory's not that good.
*  Maybe she's an elephant.
*  I don't think their memory's that good.
*  They say they are.
*  Yeah, but like shit that you would remember too.
*  Right, like how often do you watch one of those nature shows and you see like elephants
*  wandering around aimlessly and you know they're looking for their car because they can't remember
*  where they park.
*  Idiots.
*  Imagine if elephants could drive, that would be a real problem.
*  How big would their fucking car be?
*  How big would their roads have to be?
*  Wow.
*  If anybody else, any other animals, started developing electronics, I think we'd just
*  kill them.
*  Yeah.
*  Like what the fuck are you doing over there?
*  Like we wouldn't be cool with chimps fastening their own weapons if they started making guns.
*  If a chip starts smelting iron, like figuring out ballistics, you see chimps on the range.
*  Yeah.
*  You're like, hey, hey, hey, only us.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, isn't that what Planet of the Apes is all about?
*  Similar.
*  They evolved to the point where...
*  Wasn't the new one like experiments?
*  Wasn't it like some kind of experiments?
*  On how it's like picked off?
*  Like they would do, like back in the day it was like a time machine thing.
*  Like they went, right, like the really old ones, there's a time machine and you go forward
*  in time and you realize like, oh my god, the apes are now humans and we're bullshit.
*  Yeah, they landed so far in the future on Earth.
*  You know who wrote that one?
*  Rod Serling.
*  Oh, did he really?
*  Yeah, from Twilight Zone.
*  He was the fucking man.
*  He was the fucking man.
*  He was way ahead of his time.
*  With everything.
*  Genius.
*  So many good episodes.
*  You go back and watch the Twilight Zone, it's like, no production value, no money for special
*  effects, incredible show.
*  And that's what was part of their charm, but the music, everything worked.
*  And if you look at a lot of modern day movies, they were predicated on those old shows, like
*  Chucky, there's an old episode with Teli Savalas, Taki Tina.
*  Hi, I'm Taki Tina and I'm going to kill you.
*  This was a doll, remember?
*  Fast forward to Chucky, that demented, redheaded, freckle-faced freak.
*  Look at that.
*  There she is, Taki Tina.
*  You know my favorite one was to serve man.
*  Oh yeah, it's a cookbook.
*  Yeah.
*  And then Juliet Childs walks out of the UFO.
*  Yeah.
*  Hello everybody, we're going to serve your children.
*  What did the aliens look like on Deserve Man?
*  It was very bizarre.
*  Yeah, they had giant bulbous heads.
*  Yeah, there it is.
*  There it is.
*  Yeah.
*  They looked like Herman Munster without the hair.
*  Look how bad this fucking makeup is.
*  You can see where it's glued to his cheek.
*  You can see everything is so shitty.
*  Like you'd do better than that in a high school musical.
*  Speaking of human cookbooks, I have a buddy who just had a kid and he told me him and
*  his wife made placenta smoothies.
*  And I'm sitting here going, what if you love them?
*  What if you loved to taste your own kid?
*  And one day you're with Billy at the park and you're just looking at him and you're
*  like, you know, you start licking your lips like he sure did taste good.
*  And then cannibalism and you eat your own kid.
*  I don't think it's actually eating your own kid.
*  I think it's eating the nutrients that provide nourishment to the kid while it's in the womb.
*  It's not.
*  You're not eating the kid.
*  The kid is separate from the placenta.
*  It is?
*  Yeah, the kid is an actual.
*  Oh, I thought it was covered like, you know, when a gazelle drops its baby on the Kalahari
*  and it like licks all that that film off it.
*  Isn't that placenta?
*  Or is that just like a pasta sauce?
*  It's like carbonara.
*  I think that is placenta, right?
*  I mean, it probably must be.
*  So isn't that what human kids have?
*  But it's not the kid itself.
*  It's the nutrients that the kid was consuming while they were in the womb.
*  I believe, obviously, I'm not a doctor.
*  Look at this.
*  Is this one going to drop it?
*  They eat that.
*  Is she about to drop?
*  Boy, how vulnerable are they when they're given birth?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And half of those kids get snatched up immediately.
*  Yeah.
*  Some cats or wild dogs or something come run over and steal your baby and that's it.
*  You carry that thing around inside of you for months.
*  You love it more than anything in life.
*  They'll protect it.
*  Like, obviously, they have like this insane connection with that baby.
*  And then it gets snatched away by a cat.
*  It literally doesn't get its first bleat out.
*  Like it lifts its head and then bong, it's gone.
*  Well, that's one of the things that people have to be very aware about in North America.
*  Bears.
*  What bears are doing to deer and moose, same thing.
*  Like, if you really love deer and moose and elk and stuff like that, half of those animals, babies get eaten by bears.
*  Yeah.
*  They eat like half of the babies that come out.
*  Half?
*  Half.
*  You know, it's a good thing in a good ecosystem.
*  To cull the herd.
*  Yeah. Well, it's not even just to cull the herd.
*  It's just to, that's what they're there for.
*  Like it's a system.
*  We look at it like it's this beautiful thing because it is beautiful.
*  You see these animals and the wild and nature.
*  But what it is, it's a system.
*  It's like a mathematical system.
*  You have numbers and the amount of predators is based on the amount of prey and the amount of babies they have and the amount of babies that survive.
*  And, you know, animals that have less babies don't survive as well.
*  Animals that are bigger fight off the wolves better.
*  It's like there's a whole system.
*  The whole system.
*  And it trickles down right to the vegetation and the ecosystem.
*  You know this.
*  Like if they remove the wolves, then the elk and caribou herds expand and they start eating all the growth on the river banks causing erosion.
*  The river is flattened out.
*  So you have to have those predators.
*  So I'm glad they're eating half and I'm going to, if they're listening, eat three quarters.
*  If they weren't eating half, we would be overrun by deer and elk.
*  You'd have a situation where you have like in New Zealand where they have to fly over the hills and just gun them down.
*  Moose in New Zealand?
*  No, in New Zealand, New Zealand's a wild place.
*  Literally.
*  But it's beautiful.
*  So beautiful.
*  Elves.
*  They got there in, I get the 1700s or something like that.
*  Maybe the 1800s.
*  And these European settlers, these European explorers, like this place is so beautiful, but it doesn't have any things for us to kill.
*  Why don't we bring in a bunch of wild animals from Europe that we like to kill?
*  And so they turned it into like a wild game safari park for hunting.
*  Jeezu.
*  Yeah. So there's all these animals like stags and all these different kinds of deer.
*  All these animals that are not supposed to be in New Zealand.
*  They're everywhere.
*  They're so overwhelming.
*  Like if you buy elk, like if you go to a restaurant and you buy elk tenderloin, most likely that elk is coming from New Zealand.
*  No.
*  Yeah.
*  There's elk in New Zealand?
*  A lot of elk in New Zealand.
*  And it's probably, they probably are allowed to consider stag elk too.
*  I don't think they, that's a good question.
*  I don't know.
*  They're so similar.
*  They're such a similar animal.
*  They probably taste exactly the same.
*  You know, elk have a cool sound, but stags have a really cool, stags sound like a lion.
*  You ever heard a stag roar?
*  Yeah.
*  It's really fucking cool.
*  And then when they mate, the male elks do that whistle.
*  You know, that sounds like they're playing a piccolo.
*  Listen to this.
*  What a weird noise.
*  Yeah.
*  Look at his penis going up and down.
*  Oh yeah.
*  They jizz all over themselves.
*  Wow.
*  I've seen elk do it where they just piss all over themselves while they're screaming.
*  They're screaming.
*  Elks are even cooler.
*  Give me an elk, an elk bugle.
*  Elk bugle I think is the coolest sound in the world.
*  Oh, me?
*  Bro, if you didn't know, if you didn't know, if you were in the dark and you were in the
*  encamping and you heard an elk bugle and you didn't know what that was, you'd think, oh my God, there's monsters out here.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, there it is.
*  Couldn't you imagine that being a monster?
*  Yeah.
*  It's sort of like an instrument.
*  Imagine if it's dark out and you hear that.
*  You're like, fuck!
*  It's demons!
*  Yeah, that's kind of haunting and scary.
*  That's the greatest animal life.
*  And then they go into the big cats go into Fleming.
*  You know this?
*  Fleming?
*  I ran into problems with girlfriends because of this.
*  It's like when the female lions or the leopards, they get ripe, you know what I mean?
*  Ready to party.
*  Yeah, let's go.
*  The lions and the cheetahs, they do this thing where they smell the female scent and they
*  You know, they do this thing where they curl their lip up.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's like a sexual thing and that I for some reason, I don't know why, but I do that when I'm about to get into some love making.
*  You do a little bit of that?
*  Do you like embody the lion?
*  I don't know.
*  I just have the thing.
*  And they never stick around.
*  Yeah.
*  Fleming response takes place when one lion of either sex sniffs or smells the urine of another.
*  Chemicals and hormones contained in the urine elicit the Fleming response.
*  Usually after smelling the urine patch on the ground or vegetation, the cat is doing the smelling will lift his or her head and hold their lips back in a strong grimace.
*  Let me see it.
*  Yeah, you know, and I got it's just like him.
*  Look, I got to start dating girls that wipe, I guess.
*  Look at his face.
*  That urine.
*  I'm looking at that right before it fucking closes down on your neck.
*  Oh, yeah, I'm not getting out of this.
*  There is fucking no escape.
*  There's no hip escape.
*  There's no jiu jitsu move.
*  There's no poking in the eye.
*  That's a rap.
*  It's a rap.
*  Look at that mouth.
*  That is a rap, a rap.
*  I had a moment when I was on safari in Africa where it's the only time in my life I started shaking.
*  We were on a private Land Rover.
*  We came up on two male lions that had just made a kill.
*  We were literally probably, I'd say, 25 feet from them.
*  And one of them got up and we're in the open Land Rover, right, with no protection, no windows.
*  That is such bullshit.
*  So we got the guy driving from our camp and this thing, one of them got up, walked halfway to us and just did that burning stare with its golden eyes.
*  Oh, my God.
*  And I was holding the van and my hand, because it is one of the few times in my life I felt like I was in death's door.
*  Like that lion could have been on me in two seconds and it was terrifying but exhilarating at the same time.
*  How would they know that the lions won't jump into the cab and pull people out?
*  They get acclimated to these kind of clunky things.
*  Look, believe me, I know nature's unpredictable.
*  What kind of trust do you have to have?
*  Well, I said to our driver, he was parked in front of a stump.
*  I said to him, I said, dude, I know you do this every day.
*  Get away from the stump.
*  We need to have an exit strategy.
*  Yeah.
*  And so he goes, oh, we'll be fine.
*  I said, no, move from the stump, because nature, you don't know when nature's going to do that.
*  Did you know that it was going to be an open air thing?
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  And you were cool with that?
*  Yeah, it's beautiful.
*  I thought, I didn't know we were going to come up on two male lions that were in the middle of eating a wildebeest
*  and be the only ones there and like 25 feet away, and one of them was going to shorten the distance by half.
*  Oh, God.
*  Was this before or after the lady from Game of Thrones who was the video editor?
*  She was one of the video editors of Game of Thrones.
*  She got pulled out of a car by a lion.
*  Oh, she did?
*  Well, there you go.
*  There's your answer.
*  Yeah, it can happen.
*  It was a different situation, though.
*  I don't think they were acclimated to the open air ones, because in this one, it was cars,
*  and she rolled her window down to reach out to take a picture, and the cat just snatched her.
*  Oh, idiot.
*  It's like a toy.
*  I mean, you're basically rolling a piece of yarn.
*  If a cat sees a thing that he couldn't get, but now he can get it, their instinct is just to get it.
*  Like, even if they never would do that, if the windows were rolled down from the beginning,
*  the moment they see you peeking out, you're basically dangling.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, it's just a video of it?
*  No, no, it's just a picture.
*  This is how it happened?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, God, that's so horrible, man.
*  Oh, my God, look how big that thing is.
*  Imagine that pulling you out of the fucking car.
*  Oh, my God.
*  So I was in Florida once, and I was doing a gig on one side of Florida and had to cross over to the other side.
*  Whoa.
*  And in between...
*  Were you walking?
*  No, no, no.
*  Daddy had a...
*  Here's where it got clunky, right?
*  I rented a convertible, right?
*  Oh, boy.
*  Because it's Florida.
*  Right.
*  So I had time to kill, so I looked on the thing.
*  Halfway across, there's a lion safari where you can drive through, right?
*  And you drove through in a convertible?
*  No, so I pulled up, and they said, sir, you can't go through with a convertible,
*  but for 10 extra dollars, we'll rent you one of our little junkers.
*  And the junkers were painted like a zebra because it was a lion park, so they painted them with stripes.
*  It was like a piece of crap that was just meant to go through the two-mile park and out.
*  So it's like a million degrees.
*  It's Florida.
*  It's Tuesday on that one in the afternoon.
*  No one's there because I'm cutting across the country.
*  This is like a weekend place.
*  They put me in this zebra mobile.
*  I'm all alone in this park.
*  I get right in the middle of the lion thing.
*  There's like 60 lions.
*  The car conks out.
*  300 degrees, no AC because it's an old junker, and I just got 60 lions just going, zebra?
*  And I'm just sitting there.
*  No one's coming.
*  Daddy's sitting there in the pride.
*  How long did you sit there for?
*  I sat there for about 15, 20 minutes until they came, and I got to crack the window because it's like a dog in a Walmart parking lot.
*  And I'm sitting there going, I'm a zebra.
*  I'm sitting there.
*  I'm a zebra.
*  You could die of heat exposure in there.
*  Or by getting mauled by a pride of lions.
*  Does that mean they're gay if it's a pride of lions, by the way?
*  No, pride isn't always gay.
*  Okay, they look gay to me.
*  Pride didn't used to be gay.
*  It used to be like you're proud of something.
*  One of them had their hair fluffed out.
*  He looks pretty gay.
*  It's actually in the Bible.
*  Lions?
*  They're gay?
*  Pride.
*  Pride.
*  It's not good.
*  Wait.
*  What are we talking about?
*  Is it the same thing?
*  I don't know.
*  It's in the Bible.
*  It's one of the sins.
*  What, pride?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh yeah, it's one of the other six like.
*  So why would you make a thing that is like, I have American pride.
*  I love America.
*  I do have American pride.
*  I'm a patriot.
*  I think this is an amazing place.
*  Yeah.
*  So I have pride.
*  So does that mean I'm gay or does it mean I'm sinning?
*  Hmm.
*  Well, if it's just the verb, you're just.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  It's like what a flexible word.
*  If you're trying to learn American English, like how we use things, like just English,
*  and you spoke another language that was more logical, you'd be like what the fuck?
*  Why don't you have different words?
*  Why do you have the same word that means such different things?
*  Like the word rose.
*  Isn't there like seven different meanings for the word rose?
*  Well there's the flower.
*  The rose up.
*  Rose of corn.
*  Right?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Like it's just like.
*  Right.
*  I didn't think of rose of corn.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Rose the boat.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my god.
*  There's so many.
*  That's so stupid.
*  Well there's two there.
*  There's R-O-S-C and R-O-W-S.
*  Same sound.
*  Same thing.
*  Did you run out of sounds?
*  Yeah.
*  Obviously you didn't.
*  They're making new pronoun sounds every day.
*  Yeah.
*  You could have called rose of corn like clonk of corn.
*  Something that doesn't make me fucking confused.
*  Especially if I'm learning the language like I speak Portuguese or something.
*  Hold on my friend.
*  Did you say the same word?
*  Like what the fuck are you saying?
*  What a goofy.
*  You need so much context to be able to like figure out.
*  I think English is supposed to be one of the most difficult languages to learn.
*  I think Russian is very hard.
*  Chinese is very hard.
*  Mandarin is very hard.
*  Manatee.
*  Is that what you said?
*  Mandarin.
*  Like Chinese.
*  Oh god.
*  Imagine like you can speak it but you can't read it or write it.
*  Because that happens with a lot of Asian languages.
*  Like to learn Japanese.
*  It's like speaking Japanese is hard.
*  But now you have to learn how to read it and write it.
*  Like that's extra hard.
*  I got a story for you about that a little later.
*  Did you learn Japanese?
*  I sort of.
*  Well Vietnamese.
*  Did you?
*  I sort of had to.
*  Were you in Nam?
*  Eh.
*  Possibly.
*  I did two tours in Nam.
*  And I got to say Sunquest bus lines.
*  The best tours.
*  Oh god.
*  Air conditioned buses.
*  It's another thing.
*  Two tours.
*  Yeah.
*  Right?
*  Tours.
*  Very different meaning if you're talking about Vietnam in 1967.
*  Huge difference.
*  Big difference.
*  I found out.
*  Do you mind if I just dip into, I brought a little something I have to do about every
*  20 minutes.
*  I do apologize.
*  What is it?
*  I have to, I have an eating thing I have to do.
*  Really?
*  Well if you don't mind.
*  No, no not at all.
*  Thank you.
*  Oh god.
*  What is your eating thing?
*  I'm a little embarrassed.
*  But um.
*  I have a tapeworm.
*  For real?
*  Yeah.
*  Like a, it's about almost four feet.
*  Have you ever had one?
*  You really do?
*  Yeah.
*  I never know with you you know.
*  I don't know if I should feel bad or start mocking you.
*  Well you can do whatever.
*  I don't know if I feel bad if it's true.
*  You have a real tapeworm?
*  I do.
*  How'd you get it?
*  You think?
*  I was in the Galapagos Islands recently and we, they have a rodent over there called the
*  Bermuda eel rat and it's not a documented species, it's the local jargon.
*  Everything evolves in, as you know through Darwin, everything evolved over in the Galapagos,
*  the tortoises, everything.
*  It's a unique place where evolution took place.
*  And I guess this rat became a bit elongated, its spine, and so they call it the, came off
*  of, originally off of Bermuda like transport ship or something.
*  Right.
*  And so they eat it over there.
*  And I ate the damn thing and I got a parasite that led to a tapeworm and she's about a
*  four footer.
*  What do they do to get out, get it out?
*  Well, they have pills, but this is, I don't even know if I should talk about this but
*  I, it's a little odd I sort of got attached to the little fella.
*  Oh you like having it now?
*  Well, you know we hear all this talk about you know women and men and men can have babies.
*  They're telling men they can have children.
*  So you got a little baby tapeworm.
*  Well, let's just say I have something living inside me and I sort of like it.
*  I sort of like, sometimes I can feel it moving around.
*  Sometimes I'll put a piece of cheese in the bed at night and it'll come out and I feel
*  like I have a tail.
*  And so what I have to do is I have to, I have to eat.
*  Celery.
*  Well, what it does, it reacts to the vibration of sound and celery's kind of got the best
*  kind of crunch and it kind of settles the guy down.
*  Okay.
*  Just, I just need to take a couple of bites.
*  Okay, go ahead, draw.
*  Oh, you're going to laugh.
*  You have to do this about every 20 minutes.
*  For the tapeworm.
*  Yeah, settles him down.
*  I think you're going to a bad doctor.
*  I think you're getting bad advice.
*  No, I just mean for me.
*  For you.
*  This is like a self-medicating.
*  I think they can get rid of those things, man.
*  No, but what I'm saying, I've grown attached to Demetri.
*  I understand.
*  I like little Demetri.
*  He's probably like, you know, I have a forced labor.
*  But I like Demetri.
*  Yeah, but you can't keep a baby inside you forever.
*  The whole idea is the baby gets born and then it goes out.
*  Hold on, Dr. Spock.
*  These suckers can grow up to 30 feet long.
*  Mine's a four footer.
*  Can they really get that big?
*  How do they know how big yours is?
*  Were they doing MRI or something?
*  Well, they did.
*  We did an ultrasound.
*  And they could see the tapeworm inside of you?
*  They can see it.
*  Do you have a picture of that?
*  I don't have a picture handy.
*  How do you not have a picture on your phone of that?
*  Of my kid, of little Demetri.
*  Yeah, it seems like you'd be really sad if you didn't have a picture of him.
*  I got to bring one in.
*  When I come back next week, I'll bring one in.
*  Tapeworms or sestotodes, could range in length one meter up to 50 feet.
*  50 feet, dude.
*  15 meters, the length and width of the tapeworms can vary depending upon the species.
*  Wow.
*  Pork, beef, fish, tapeworms can grow to be 15 to 30 feet.
*  And Bermuda eel rats.
*  Do they have that there?
*  How'd that rat taste?
*  You know, it's kind of good.
*  They season it up with the Galapagos seasoning.
*  It's kind of like blackened catfish, but it's like Galapagos seasoning.
*  So you think all those people that live there probably have tapeworms?
*  I don't know if they have it, but I sure got it.
*  They have to have it.
*  If you got it, that must mean everybody has it.
*  Unbelievable.
*  There's places in the world that, especially tropical places, where most people have some kind of parasite.
*  It just becomes a part of your body.
*  You now exist with that thing in you forever.
*  Have you ever had a tapeworm?
*  No, I have not.
*  Do you want one?
*  No, thanks.
*  What's the worst thing you've ever had?
*  Like the worst weird ailment?
*  Staff infection.
*  No way.
*  How many people on your staff?
*  It was a small business.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, just one employee.
*  What's a staff infection?
*  It's an infection that you get on your skin.
*  It's like a bacterial infection?
*  Exactly.
*  It's really common in Jiu-Jitsu.
*  A lot of people get it and they don't recognize it.
*  Ari actually had it.
*  Ari didn't know he had it until I pointed it out.
*  We got him to the hospital right away.
*  Ari and I were playing pool and he was limping.
*  I'm like, why are you limping?
*  What?
*  He goes, I got a spider bite.
*  I go, let me see it.
*  He pulls his pants up and his knee, he has this swollen pimple on his knee and the pus at the end.
*  I go, dude, you have a staff infection.
*  We got to get you to the hospital right now.
*  He goes, are you serious?
*  Is it lethal?
*  Yeah.
*  People die.
*  If it gets systemic, if staff infections get systemic, if your body becomes septic, you could die.
*  People have died from staff.
*  It happens all the time.
*  People get it in hospitals a lot, don't they?
*  Yes.
*  Unfortunately, in hospitals, they get something called MRSA.
*  MRSA is medication resistant staff infection.
*  Wow.
*  A lot of Black Gospel singers get that, I hear.
*  MRSA?
*  That's mercy, I'm sorry.
*  What were you saying, Jamie?
*  Did you say something?
*  Oh, I thought I heard you.
*  I thought I heard something.
*  I thought I heard something.
*  I thought I heard something.
*  I thought I heard something.
*  Yeah, I thought I heard something too.
*  How many people a year die from staff infections?
*  I think it's a big number.
*  Wow.
*  I know quite a few people that have been deathly ill from staff infections and had to go to
*  the hospital and get their legs cut open and get their legs drained.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  It's a horrible, horrible thing to watch.
*  Like, it eats holes in people.
*  Have you ever watched staff infection surgeries?
*  No, no, no.
*  I mean, I've seen them online.
*  2017, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that almost 20,000 people in the
*  United States died from bloodstream infections caused by staff.
*  That's 2017.
*  It killed 20,000 people.
*  Yeah, so that's the worst thing I've had, for sure.
*  How long did it last?
*  It didn't last very long because I caught it.
*  I got real lucky.
*  I caught it quick.
*  I was at an airport with my friend Tate and I had these little pimples on my calf.
*  Oh, God.
*  And he goes, hey, what is that on your calf?
*  I go, I don't know, something.
*  And he goes, do I think that's staff?
*  I go, really?
*  He goes, yeah, you should get it looked at.
*  So immediately I went to a dermatologist and he's like, yeah, it looks like staff.
*  And he put me in antibiotics before they even got the results of the test back.
*  He put you on it, not your cow?
*  My cow.
*  I thought you said your calf.
*  Calf, like leg, the part of your leg.
*  That one, you really went out there with that one.
*  That's the worst thing.
*  Do you really have a tapeworm?
*  I do.
*  For real?
*  Yes, please.
*  And what do they have you on?
*  Ivermectin?
*  What do they have you on?
*  They don't have it.
*  They just, you can't get it.
*  All they do is kill it.
*  It can live in your system, they told me, for your whole life.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, have you ever seen bears?
*  They have them sticking out of their ass.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Like a fucking hose, like a garden hose, just hang down.
*  You ever seen the worms that come out of praying mantises?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  They're like huge.
*  They put a praying mantis in water, and that bastard must not have been praying enough
*  because it's got a tapeworm longer than Dolly Parton's ass hair.
*  Not only that, those worms, those aquatic worms, trick grasshoppers into drowning themselves.
*  What are you doing, man?
*  Don't do that.
*  No, the pulp.
*  I know, but don't just grab it and put it on the table.
*  I know, but I felt like I was chewing cud.
*  Well, I put it on this other celery.
*  I would never put cud on your table.
*  Just stop with the celery, please.
*  Well, I don't want Demetri to get upset.
*  You need to reach into your asshole and pull Demetri out.
*  Wow.
*  You need to like, you know, like with your shoulders down the ground, ass up here, just
*  get in there.
*  Dude, Joseph.
*  And give birth.
*  Joseph, dial it down.
*  I'm not going to.
*  Does he ever turtle on you?
*  Yes.
*  Does he?
*  That's why I call him Demetri.
*  One night I put out a piece of feta cheese, the Greek stuff, and he went nuts, came out.
*  Came out, huh?
*  Have you ever seen a Burmese python?
*  Yes.
*  I had a lady friend over and I guess little Demetri got jealous and I woke up all I heard
*  was, and I looked over.
*  He was choked there.
*  He was, yeah, unbelievable.
*  How were you laying?
*  Spooning.
*  Like, where's her face?
*  Is it like right where your ass is?
*  Well, we spoon upside down.
*  I'm like feeling it, it makes sense.
*  She uses my nose like a bicycle rack.
*  You have to come up.
*  Yeah, it's not pretty, but he's my boy.
*  How long is it going to take to kill him?
*  I don't want to kill him.
*  This is why I'm...
*  No, but for real, for real.
*  How long is it going to take to kill it?
*  Well, once you take those pills, you can kill it like within about three days.
*  And you're not taking the pills?
*  No.
*  I'm telling you, guy, you know, I feel like I have a boy inside me.
*  Wow, wait a minute.
*  Like a child.
*  Okay.
*  Well, good luck with that.
*  Thank you.
*  If you see, I want to see a photo of those bears.
*  The bears that have it, it's so disgusting.
*  It looks like enormous spaghetti.
*  Oh, with the tin, yeah.
*  Have you ever been attacked by a bear?
*  No.
*  I'm here, right?
*  Well, look at that.
*  There are survivors and I can...
*  Look at that tapeworm coming out of his asshole.
*  How crazy is that?
*  Whoa, looks like he just got married.
*  You should put tin cans on the end of those.
*  Look at that fucking...
*  He's just hoping someone steps on it so he can pull it out of his ass.
*  Yeah.
*  It looks like he was parachuting and he landed and he's dragging the parachute.
*  I mean, how insane is that?
*  Wow.
*  I mean, their whole body is just a disgusting mess.
*  Yeah.
*  Like when you eat bears...
*  You eat bear?
*  Yeah, I've eaten bear.
*  Grizz, black bear, polar.
*  Black bear.
*  Black bear, not grizz?
*  No, I've never had one of those.
*  Why'd you eat black bear?
*  Well, I hunted them.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, they have to.
*  I heard it's kind of a musky, kind of weird taste.
*  No, it really depends on what they've been eating.
*  But most, unfortunately, most of those bears are probably eating calves, moose calves and fawns, deer fawns.
*  They tasted good.
*  Black bears are kind of like goats though.
*  They'll eat just about anything.
*  They eat a lot.
*  Do you know that in the early days the pioneers used to eat bear and they'd use deer for skin?
*  Say again?
*  They'd just use deer skins.
*  They'd just use the hide from deer.
*  They were eating bear.
*  Oh, I see.
*  They ate bear more than they ate anything else.
*  Is that right?
*  Yeah, isn't that crazy?
*  Well, maybe there was a reason for that because the bear was a threat to them.
*  So maybe it's like let's kill the thing that could kill our cattle or kill our children and let's eat that versus the docile.
*  This is just a theory I just came up with.
*  No, it's a good theory.
*  That makes sense.
*  You know.
*  They thought it tasted the most like beef, whereas like venison was different.
*  Really?
*  Venison has its own taste.
*  Yeah.
*  So they ate a lot of bear.
*  Black bears are dangerous, but grizzles are the one you got to be careful about.
*  They're all dangerous, man.
*  They're all bears.
*  I don't know if I can I share something with you?
*  Please do.
*  I'm a blueberry nut.
*  Like I like blueberries.
*  When blueberry season hits in early spring, I'm nuts about it.
*  How's Demetri feel about that?
*  Well, he likes celery.
*  I don't give him berries.
*  How dare you make fun of my boy, Joe.
*  Anyway, blueberries.
*  So this was about seven years ago.
*  I'm up on a hill in Banff out in Canada in the Rocky Mountains.
*  Grizz, you know, grizz.
*  And I'll use a line from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.
*  Remember Caracadus Potts?
*  He was the father to Dick Van Dyke.
*  And he used this line where he's singing.
*  He goes, he's doing a song in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.
*  And he does a line where he goes, and the bear came a lullipin over the mountain.
*  And I'm sitting there picking blueberries.
*  And this behemoth comes flying over the hill.
*  So that was a grizzly bear.
*  That was a grizzly bear.
*  It was a grizz.
*  And when they attack, they roll you.
*  They roll and claw.
*  And I've never done this, but...
*  You're such a dork.
*  What do you mean?
*  Well...
*  Is that a real fucking tattoo?
*  Let me see that again.
*  Let me see that again.
*  Dude, this is not easy for me to talk about.
*  The bear came a lullipin over the mountain.
*  And uh...
*  That tattoo belongs to a mechanic in Idaho, and you need to give it back to him.
*  Joe?
*  Let me see it again.
*  What the...
*  Let me see it again.
*  The bear came a lullipin over the mountain.
*  How dare you, sir.
*  Is that the longest anyone's ever gone for a gag?
*  That's... that is... yeah, that's the furthest anyone's ever gone.
*  You actually got it tattooed on your chest.
*  Well, hang on, guy.
*  I'm trying to tell you, I got attacked by a grizz.
*  You know what?
*  Oh my God!
*  That's probably the bear hurt he chewed celery.
*  And you know what I did? I did a thing, I invented it called the jelly roll.
*  Because I'm in the blueberries.
*  The only way to evade the grizz, I roll down the hill, he's ripping my chest straight down the hill into a river.
*  Boom! Bouncing around like Moses with tuberculosis teeth.
*  You're making jelly as you roll through the blueberries.
*  Yeah, I'm crushing the... yeah.
*  And this bear was just befuddled, just stood there, looked like Forrest Gump with a Chinese dildo up his ass.
*  Now, mountain lion on the other hand, can I share something with you?
*  Does this involve another tattoo?
*  Well, no, the mountain lion...
*  What the fuck is that?
*  He...
*  Did you glue those on?
*  What the fuck is wrong with them?
*  Mountain lion scrapes, he digs in with his claws.
*  What is wrong with you? Can a guy have adventure stories in nature?
*  Yeah, that makeup artist, whoever did that, they're like from the Twilight Zone, same person.
*  Same person who did that fucking... that alien's head.
*  It fell off.
*  Hey, you're healing by the power of Jesus.
*  Oh, God.
*  You're healing.
*  Yeah.
*  But here's where I talked to you earlier about learning Mandarin.
*  Here's the difference between the evolution of nature, mammals, critters, and human beings.
*  Cut to about eight years ago, I'm on the Mackenzie River, and there's white water like you wouldn't believe.
*  Little Vietnamese boy named Kim Il-Long, wow, freckles on his face, unbelievable.
*  Tips, okay?
*  Bears, wild cats, they just scratch.
*  The ingenuity, the intelligence of a human, I jump in, grab little Kim Il-Long, wow, he starts scratching me.
*  Can I show you something?
*  Look at this.
*  Look at this.
*  This kid scratched the shit out of me, and even in a panic state, I had to learn Mandarin.
*  This is, t'was the night before Christmas.
*  Well...
*  Jeez, man.
*  Unbelievable.
*  What was his name again?
*  Little Kim Il-Long, wow.
*  He had freckles on his face, it looked like Dolly Parton serving Apple Cobbler if he joined them.
*  He was Vietnamese?
*  Vietnamese boy, Kim Il-Long, wow.
*  Why would a Vietnamese kid have freckles? That seems uncommon.
*  That's what was so weird, that's how he stood out amongst all the other boys.
*  He's like a child of an American GI?
*  I don't know, but just unbelievable kid to see a little Vietnamese boy with freckles.
*  You don't get that.
*  How many American V...
*  That was always a thing, like those Chuck Norris action movies, remember?
*  Like Missing in Action?
*  Yeah.
*  It was always about guys that were still stuck over there and we had to go get them.
*  Nobody kind of forgot about that.
*  Are those the guys that inspired you, like Norris?
*  Oh yeah, definitely.
*  Bruce Lee.
*  When you were a kid, did you sneak into the movies?
*  I went to the movies, and it was on television too when I was a kid.
*  The first Bruce Lee movie I ever saw was on television.
*  I couldn't believe it.
*  I was like, look at that guy.
*  That's insane, how's he doing that?
*  But like those Missing in Action movies was all about missing POWs.
*  And then we always used to talk, that was always a thing that like the POWs from Vietnam got left behind.
*  And like Chuck Norris is going to go back and get them and set them free.
*  How many POWs got left behind in Vietnam?
*  Because that's a fucking real thing, man.
*  Not only was it a bullshit war, but people went over there and they left.
*  John McCain, remember him?
*  Yeah, he was a prisoner for years.
*  His shoulders were all fucked up.
*  Yeah, he couldn't put his arms down.
*  I remember I went on a roller coaster with him once, and at the end of it I was like, guy, it's done.
*  And he was still...
*  That's how crazy Trump is.
*  Trump made fun of him getting caught.
*  Yeah.
*  Trump said, well, I like guys that do that.
*  No, Trump said, well, I like guys that didn't get caught.
*  What the fuck are you saying?
*  Like you were going to run away? You would have run away?
*  Would you be...
*  If you're his enemy, he doesn't give a fuck. He'll say anything.
*  You're skewered. You're skewered.
*  Even if it doesn't make any sense, he'll say it like, what? Guys who don't get caught? What?
*  Yeah.
*  How can you fucking say that about a war hero? Jesus Christ.
*  That's true. Wild.
*  Crazy, but he's my enemy. Fuck him.
*  Yeah. No holes barred. Battle mode.
*  How many American soldiers got left behind in Vietnam?
*  I was trying to find out.
*  And this is, by the way, they're not going to tell you the real number, right?
*  They're not?
*  No, they didn't tell you why we're going into the war in the first place.
*  I'm sure that even the death count was probably disputed. Who knows?
*  Have you ever romanticized being in combat like that, even though it's the death zone?
*  Because you're a hunter. You're skilled with the rifle.
*  Have you ever sort of imaginary, like immersed yourself into a Vietnamese battle scene?
*  No. Nor could I imagine those guys who got conscripted. They got drafted.
*  So you didn't even want to do it. Maybe you just wanted to build cars.
*  Maybe you wanted to be a painter. And all of a sudden you're over there with a rifle in the dark, in the jungle.
*  But does the hunter side of you go in there and imagine like you could excel in that environment?
*  No. The hunter is a totally different experience.
*  The hunting side of me is like dipping my toe into the natural world, like getting my food the hard way.
*  The hunter in me is going out and finding food and interacting with nature. But the elk are not my enemy. I love them.
*  Right. But is there a thrill to the kill though? There has to be a moment of sort of adrenaline and jubilation when you man conquers beast. Does that exist?
*  The thrill is that you pulled off a difficult thing. It's very hard to do. And it's very hard to make a shot with a bow and arrow on an animal.
*  It's hard in a lethal shot. And to be able to do it consistently. To do it every time you hunt to be able to make a lethal shot.
*  And I'm talking about like 50 yards, 60 yards.
*  Oh wow. Do you strictly use bow and arrow? Yes. Oh I didn't know that. I thought you had rifles too.
*  I shoot with rifles. I killed a pig last year with a rifle. Wow what'd the farmer say?
*  Turned him into a sausage. It was a wild one. Oh how big. They actually had to kill him. It was pretty big. 200 pounds. Texas?
*  No this was in California. And so I ate him just the other day. Was she sag? No it was a boy. It was a boy pig.
*  No I said was she sag? I know what you're saying. California. Is that a joke? An actor joke? Yeah.
*  I gotcha. I gotcha. What was I saying though? What was I on about? Well you were talking about the hunting versus war. War to me is insane.
*  I don't know. I got to. War to me is like I don't want to have nothing to do with that. I would never know. Really?
*  There's no little piece of you that you're in the dark jungle. That's someone's boy. That's someone's baby boy.
*  I don't think of it even as a man. That's someone's baby boy that I don't know. That guy has parents and they probably love him.
*  And he probably has a wife and she loves him and he probably has friends and they love him. I like it that you said that.
*  And then some fucking politician is telling me that that guy's my enemy. I bet that guy and I if we could speak the language we'd have a beer together and have a good time.
*  What a great answer. He probably doesn't want to have anything to do with killing me and I don't want to have anything to do with killing him.
*  And we're both being suckered into this thing by a bunch of assholes who are just making money. I love that answer Joe. If I could fly over this table and hug you I would.
*  We hug a lot.
*  But it reminds me of a movie. Did you ever see this old movie with Lee Marvin? And I can't remember the other actor. He was a Japanese actor.
*  But this was a movie I think in the 60s where they're both in the war. The Japanese pilot and Lee Marvin. They both crashed on a remote island.
*  Supreme enemies. And they only had each other. And a box of sake somehow got stranded on the island. And they became the best friends in the world.
*  And I think if everyone looked through that prism in life they would forget about all the war and the violence. When you realize someone else is exactly like you.
*  Exactly.
*  You need someone else and they have the same fears, desires, passions and wants as you. It's such a beautiful movie.
*  You know, we're all the freaking same. Whenever you get into an altercation with someone you feel dislike towards someone you should always just pitch yourself trapped on an island with that person and go, you know what?
*  If I were alone with them I would love them. They'd be my best friend.
*  You'd figure it out.
*  It's a mental thing. If everyone kind of adopted that mentality I think things would be nice.
*  Things could be a lot better. We're divided by so many things in this world. We're divided by politics. You hear Robert De Niro screaming in front of people about Trump.
*  Horrible.
*  What are you doing? What is this? This is silly behavior. All this is so silly.
*  Not only that, labeling them, calling them clowns and denigrating them saying you're less than me because I like this and you like that.
*  It's all insane.
*  Do you remember that there was a beautiful experiment done by Jane Elliot in the 1960s where she took a classroom of children and she said all the children with brown eyes raise your hands and all the children with blue eyes raise your hands.
*  And she separated them. And you can find it on YouTube. She told all the blue-eyed children that they were beautiful, they were smarter, they were more superior than the brown-eyed children.
*  And she conducted this experiment for a week and over the course of the days the blue-eyed children started denigrating and looking down on the brown-eyed children and acting superior.
*  And then halfway through the experiment Jane Elliot goes, oh, I made a mistake. It's the brown-eyed children that are more superior.
*  And so the whole thing shifted and all the children in that class got to feel what it was like to be put down, to have racism towards them.
*  It was a fascinating experiment. It's on YouTube. If you ever want to watch it, it's mesmerizing.
*  It's an interesting experiment. Like, what the fuck, lady? You're playing tricks on kids?
*  Well, I think she was trying to demonstrate.
*  I get you're demonstrating, but you're also tricking these kids into thinking that way.
*  Well, I think she was setting the table for them in life saying, hey, don't think you're better than anyone. We're all the same. And don't let people tell you you're better than everyone.
*  And it was also a social experiment that was documented, too.
*  Would you let your kid do that?
*  Do that kind of experiment?
*  Yeah, if they didn't know, would you let them sign up for that?
*  Yeah.
*  And talk shit to the blue-eyed kids?
*  You know what? I'd let my kid live through that.
*  I would hope I would have told my kid a long time ago that that would be nonsense and that they wouldn't believe that.
*  Right. I would teach my kid that. But it's one thing to tell a kid something and then to let something play out in the real world. It's a different thing.
*  People, humans have a tendency to get caught up in the fever of things, you know?
*  Like COVID.
*  Like COVID? Like politics?
*  Like all of this stuff. Yeah.
*  Anytime there's any sort of international conflict.
*  Yeah.
*  Palestine and Israel, Ukraine, Russia.
*  You have a sect of people that sort of know what's what. And then you have a large sect of people that just get caught up in the furor of it.
*  And it's scary to see how quickly people are absorbed by it and caught up in it. It's frightening.
*  Well, you ever been to a protest?
*  No.
*  Protests feel like a mob. It feels dangerous.
*  When there's a bunch of people walking around, even if it's peaceful, and they're cheering, especially if they're cheering about something that happened that was violent.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're angry and they're demanding something and they're all marching.
*  It's like, you. I think that ignites in human beings the same feelings of war.
*  Yeah.
*  Does my cough button still bust a jam or did you swap that out?
*  You okay?
*  It's going to be a pain in the ass to swap it.
*  We had a cough button. I don't think that's how it works.
*  There. It's working there.
*  Do you want to try?
*  No. No, it's just phlegm.
*  Well.
*  I'm good to go. I don't need celery.
*  Please.
*  No, thank you.
*  Why?
*  I don't have any tapeworms and I don't enjoy celery.
*  Well, can't you accept the gift?
*  I like it with peanut butter. Do you have any peanut butter?
*  This motherfucker might have peanut butter.
*  How about a cauliflower?
*  No, that's not the same thing.
*  Well, it's got the same letters in it.
*  No, no, no. It doesn't have all of them. It's missing the B.
*  I thought you liked cauliflower.
*  No.
*  Well, now what am I going to do?
*  Just put it down.
*  Well.
*  What were we just talking about before that?
*  Vietnam.
*  Are you okay, guy?
*  Yeah, I just got this phlegm thing.
*  Maybe you've got phlegm.
*  Maybe.
*  Whoa. Whoa.
*  Oh, I like that.
*  Oh.
*  Imagine what they can smell.
*  You ever do that noise when you're making love?
*  No.
*  Why not?
*  What the fuck are you doing?
*  Dude, it's primal. Women love it.
*  You should get up and leave.
*  No. Here's an experiment from me to you.
*  I want you to try that.
*  Animal noises.
*  Next time you're making love, not to get into your purse.
*  I respect your personal space, but doggy style right by her ear.
*  Carl just started barking.
*  Listen to Carl. Listen to Carl.
*  Wow.
*  I've never seen Carl do that. Has Carl ever done that before?
*  Wow.
*  There's a few noises in here that might woke him up, but he's...
*  Wow.
*  He's fired up. That is crazy. Look at it. He really believes.
*  I have a... like if calling dogs was a thing, I'd have a really good career in dog calling.
*  Let's hear your growl.
*  Animal noises.
*  Yeah.
*  Dude, you gotta...
*  Carl believes it.
*  You gotta try that with your wife.
*  Poor Carl.
*  Oh, sorry Carl.
*  Poor Carl.
*  Oh God. He thinks he's walked into a wolf pack.
*  Yeah. He's like, someone's going to eat me. This is bullshit.
*  These guys have been pretending to be my friends.
*  They've been letting me bite their fingers the whole time. They're setting me up.
*  Dude, I'm telling you, try that with the wife.
*  Sorry Carl.
*  You gotta try it.
*  Sorry Carl.
*  Poor Carl.
*  Poor little Carl.
*  Poor Carl.
*  He's like, what the fuck?
*  That's a good noise.
*  Thank you.
*  Where'd you acquire that skill? Because I learned it when I had a puppy.
*  I like to communicate to animals in their own language if you can.
*  Right.
*  You have dogs, right?
*  Yeah. But I just talk to him.
*  You don't do that?
*  He hardly ever barks. He very, very, very rarely barks.
*  He'll bark if he has to go outside, like if he has diarrhea, he'll bark.
*  Like, bark, and get by the door and go,
*  Rarr, fuck, Chad, help me out.
*  Whoa.
*  Or he'll bark if he sees something. You know what he used to bark?
*  Carl's done, huh?
*  Wow.
*  He's fired Carl up.
*  He's terrified.
*  Now he wants to bite us, man. He's a little gangster.
*  He'll, you remember those inflatable snowmen that people would have on their front lawn?
*  Yeah.
*  Around Christmas time?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  He barks at those.
*  What, your dog? Why?
*  I don't know. He thinks it's a thing.
*  He wants to tell me there's a big animal there. He's like letting me know.
*  Yeah.
*  He's like, Dad! What the fuck is that, Dad?
*  Maybe he thinks it's a Yeti, like one of those abominable snowmen.
*  I bet he thinks it's a bear. I bet it's just like, I bet in a dog's mind there's a shape that has two arms that stands up big,
*  and you go bark! Bark! Bark!
*  Yeah.
*  And I have to go, dude, that is just, that's a snowman. Don't worry about it.
*  I love that your dog has a diarrhea bark.
*  He has a, I gotta go out now bark. Woof!
*  But you said diarrhea.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  What's that one sound like?
*  Same thing. Woof! Woof! It's basically, hey!
*  I got the rug!
*  Hey!
*  Let's go to Taco Bell!
*  I got a funny video that I'll send to Jamie, and then we can watch it because it was him last night.
*  Okay.
*  Because last night he hadn't gone out in like four hours, and there was thunderstorms outside.
*  And when there's thunderstorms outside, he fucking freaks out. He freaks out.
*  Like I can't watch TV with him when there's thunderstorms.
*  He just, like, when we watch TV together, we sit on the couch and we cuddle.
*  And so I sit like this and he like puts his head like on my lap.
*  What kind of dog is this?
*  Golden Retriever.
*  Oh yeah, perfect.
*  The sweetest dog of all time.
*  And sometimes, I don't even hear it, you know, because I'm watching the movie, but all of a sudden he'll just...
*  Woof! Woof! Woof!
*  He starts like spinning around. I'm like, dude, chill out.
*  And then he just jumps off the couch, jumps back on the couch, kisses me off the couch, back on the couch.
*  Woof! Woof!
*  So last night, Jamie, I just sent this to you.
*  Last night, he had a pee. I'm like, I know you have to pee. It's like midnight. Come on, bro.
*  Like, look at this.
*  He kept jumping at me.
*  He kept jumping at me.
*  This is all just because of the lightning.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Well, I'm supposed to be the best, but he's a giant pussy when it comes to lightning.
*  Dude, please go pee.
*  I haven't peed in four hours. Come on.
*  I love you too. Come on, go potty.
*  He keeps jumping at me.
*  He's just... All he does is just jump at me.
*  You gotta pee. You gotta pee. I know.
*  But normally he'd just go out and pee.
*  100%. He literally never does this.
*  Wow.
*  But he's wagging his tail.
*  He loves it.
*  I mean, he's excited, right? His tail's not between his legs, but he's just freaked out.
*  Maybe he's got the diarrhea, but he's afraid to start so he doesn't get electrocuted.
*  Yeah. Wow.
*  Marshall, I know, but you gotta pee, dude. Come on. Go potty.
*  Marshall, please go potty.
*  Oh my God.
*  I mean, he wouldn't pee. I had to bring him back in the house. He just would not pee.
*  He just wanted to jump up and just freaked out.
*  He wanted to make sure that I was okay.
*  Like, I'm with him. You're okay. Like, he wants to be on top of you when the lightning's happening.
*  Weird.
*  Yeah. He's just like, are we okay? I'm like, we're okay.
*  Like, as long as I'm okay, he thinks it's okay.
*  He's like, we gotta get the fuck out of here. Like, his instincts are like, we're not supposed to be out in the open.
*  This is dangerous.
*  Wait, how old is he?
*  Seven.
*  Oh, so you'd think by now he'd sort of have it figured out the way animals do.
*  Well, the thing is, when he was young, until he was, I guess, three-ish, we moved here four years ago.
*  And he never really saw lightning. Like, very rarely do you see lightning in California.
*  Yeah, you're right. And we're here with thunder.
*  Yeah.
*  You rarely hear thunder.
*  Very rarely do you have those kind of crazy storms that go out here.
*  The storms they have out here are fucking wild.
*  Yeah.
*  Some guy posted a video yesterday, Jamie, on Instagram of his car getting destroyed by hail in Texas.
*  Like, some insane, like, four-inch hail chunks.
*  You see his windshield shattering, his back windshield got blown out while he's driving.
*  He's like, this is insane.
*  While he was driving, yeah.
*  He's watching his car just get destroyed. Just, wow. It's rocks. Just rocks dropping out of the sky.
*  Yeah. Sometimes I think they actually puncture right through the roof, like, through the metal.
*  Oh, yeah. You gotta think of how far. If you've got a four-inch chunk of ice that's hurling from space.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, it's basically in the clouds.
*  Yeah.
*  Look at that.
*  Oh, wow.
*  What the fuck, dude?
*  That looks like J.F. Kennedy's car.
*  He had a convertible.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  It broke windows.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah. Fucks these cars up, man.
*  Whoa, he's fingering it.
*  I wonder how many people get killed by hail every year. There's a good question.
*  Looks like they got hit by assholes.
*  Staff or hail?
*  I don't know, but I know they say about, I think they say 12 to 30 people a year, this is for real, get killed by a falling coconut.
*  150.
*  Well, not where I come from.
*  150 people a year.
*  150 now.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's gone up.
*  We were talking about, like, things that kill people, but they, like, inflate numbers. Like, marijuana kills zero.
*  Coconuts. Falling on people's heads kill 150 people.
*  We're not outlawing coconuts.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Can you imagine getting killed by a coconut?
*  It would suck.
*  What a way to go.
*  It's not good. It's not a good way to go.
*  Especially if you're, like, an accomplished person.
*  Yeah, everything's going great.
*  Like, if Steve Jobs had gotten killed by a coconut or his little brother.
*  Elon Musk. Imagine Elon Musk is killed by a coconut.
*  Yeah.
*  You would no one believe it. Like, the fucking CIA made that coconut.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  What, Jamie?
*  It's dangerous, according to the NOAA.
*  Since 2000, only four people have been killed by hail.
*  Wow.
*  Oh, wow.
*  How many people get killed every year by lightning?
*  Let's guess.
*  Okay.
*  60.
*  I'll say...
*  I don't know why I said 60.
*  200.
*  200.
*  Worldwide?
*  Globally.
*  Globally. Yeah, you're probably right.
*  20 in the U.S.
*  20 in the U.S. Wow. Every year.
*  So what is it globally?
*  Got to figure the Chinese are getting picked off by...
*  Because they got billions, right?
*  You got...
*  The odds are. And they have skyscrapers.
*  Yeah, I wonder if Kimmy Long-Wild is going to get it.
*  24,000. Wow.
*  24,000 a year?
*  Yeah.
*  Killed by lightning?
*  Wow.
*  We were both way off.
*  Wow.
*  Whoa.
*  It was a lot less than I thought it would be in America.
*  Yeah.
*  60 is what I thought in America.
*  Wow.
*  Have you ever been hit by lightning?
*  No, but my friend Remy has.
*  Remy? Did he live?
*  Yeah, he lived.
*  He was here on the podcast a couple days ago.
*  Oh, shit.
*  He got hit by lightning, I think, when he was in high school.
*  I think it made him deaf for a little bit.
*  Like, really fucked him up.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, he didn't realize what happened.
*  He just woke up on the ground.
*  And they had to piece it together that he got hit by lightning.
*  The electronic charge going through the air.
*  Unbelievable.
*  Have you seen what's going on right now in ... where is it where there's these ... is
*  it Uruguay?
*  Where is it where there's insane lightning storms that are coming out of that volcano?
*  Oh, yeah, I saw that.
*  It's a different kind of lightning.
*  So it's the particles, the charged particles that are being released by the lava ignites
*  with the air somehow.
*  We'll get some of that explained.
*  Yeah, and the smoke, too.
*  So it's a different kind of lightning.
*  The steam, the particles get caught in the steam, the translucent.
*  And it makes these insane lightning shows.
*  Like, look at this.
*  Indonesia.
*  Indonesia.
*  But it's been going on a lot lately, like even during the day.
*  There's a lot of films on TikTok and Instagram and stuff about it.
*  Bro, that is so bonkers.
*  That mean if you were alive 5,000 years ago and you saw that, you're like, oh, Satan.
*  That's where Satan lives.
*  Satan's back.
*  Fuck.
*  He's back.
*  Dude, I got news, everybody.
*  We're fucked, man.
*  Satan's back.
*  Look.
*  Look at the mountain.
*  Satan landed on the top of the mountain.
*  He's there with lightning and shit.
*  There he is.
*  It's a summer home.
*  Like, if you saw this, you'd be like, OK, that's where Satan is.
*  100%, you would think that.
*  That's where Thor is.
*  That's where the God of Thunder is.
*  That's where Beelzebub lives.
*  Look at that.
*  You would 100% Sauron lives up there.
*  That's the Eye of Sauron.
*  People don't know that lightning comes up out of the ground, too.
*  Did you know that, Joe?
*  Does it really?
*  Yeah.
*  Lightning comes.
*  People just think all lightning comes from, and I'm not talking a volcano.
*  I'm talking regular time.
*  So you could get it right up your ass if you're in the wrong spot?
*  You could get a bolt up your arse.
*  Has that even happened?
*  Can you imagine?
*  You get just your nuts blasted by lightning.
*  Poor Demetri.
*  How bad would that suck?
*  Just be walking along in the field going, wow, what a beautiful night.
*  Bang.
*  From the ground.
*  Yeah, it's true.
*  Right to your sack.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you have any pictures of that?
*  Out to your head.
*  Through your balls, out to your head.
*  Just cooked.
*  Cooked.
*  Never be the same again.
*  Cooked.
*  What was that noise you did at the end there?
*  That's the nuts.
*  You've got to think.
*  The electricity's going through the ground, in your nuts, and like, you're just going
*  through your nuts, and like, out the top of your head.
*  Just imagine your whole body captured by this lightning.
*  It would be like stepping on a landmine, but you didn't blow up.
*  It just can't.
*  Look at that.
*  Right up out of the ground.
*  Lightning trailing from ground to clouds in slow motion.
*  Wow.
*  That's insane.
*  It's like an Etch-a-Sketch.
*  Wow.
*  People don't really know these things, and that's why it's important you have me on the
*  show twice a month type of deal.
*  I'm really glad you're here for this.
*  Look how cool that looks in slow motion.
*  That's what's really happening.
*  Fuck, that's amazing.
*  Look at that.
*  Right out of the ground.
*  That's as big as any lightning strike you'll see coming out of the sky.
*  God damn, that's amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  That looks a lot like Demetri, I've got to say.
*  All the branches.
*  And this is all in slow motion.
*  Look how quick those little branches flicker off in the corners and the sides.
*  That looks a lot like Demetri's ultrasound, by the way.
*  I bet.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Just so we're clear.
*  Lightning is fucking cool.
*  Yeah.
*  That's one of the interesting things about living here is we have these lightning storms.
*  You get to watch lightning.
*  Yeah.
*  You get to see lightning.
*  Florida.
*  I think it's one of the most lightning active places on the planet.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Florida.
*  Florida's like, this is hurricane season there.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, if your planet tripped to Florida now, like, hey, you know, you gotta check that
*  weather.
*  Yeah.
*  But it can be stunningly beautiful, though.
*  I've been in scenarios where I've been in Florida at night and you got celery juice
*  on me.
*  And you look out, like, two, three miles out, and there will be active storms going on in
*  the cumulus, right?
*  The degenerative molecular charged transphyxiation particles are lighting up the clouds.
*  And it's like you're at a Judas Priest concert covered in mayonnaise.
*  You got another thing coming.
*  Yeah, just like shhhhhh.
*  And it's like all over.
*  Do you believe in the Matrix?
*  I don't disbelieve in it.
*  Because if you ever want to have it, I've got this chemically reversed inverse magnetron
*  camera.
*  And one of the things we associate with the Matrix is what?
*  Those little numbers coming down in green.
*  So if you can take a picture, think of it.
*  Where does that exist in reality?
*  But if you can go out on a stormy night like that, rain coming down with your magnetized
*  nitronic reverse camera and take a picture while lightning's flashing, think of it.
*  What are rain drops?
*  Water.
*  Right.
*  But not when you take them with an infrared metronic camera.
*  What are they then?
*  You'll see numbers in the rain drops.
*  Interesting.
*  If you believe in that stuff.
*  Well, a person's got to believe in something.
*  Do you believe in it?
*  What?
*  The Matrix.
*  I don't disbelieve in it.
*  You know, I can tell you that you've experienced it in real time.
*  How can you do that?
*  A little term, Joe Rogan, called deja vu.
*  Have you ever experienced deja vu?
*  Yes.
*  So think of it.
*  How can you be in a place that you've never been before, you're standing somewhere foreign,
*  somewhere new, and all of a sudden your brain computes that you've been in this exact moment
*  and it's undeniable?
*  Right?
*  How is that happening?
*  Well, it's not really undeniable.
*  Well, it is undeniable because you're in it.
*  Right?
*  It's probably a glitch in how you interface with reality.
*  Therefore a glitch in the Matrix.
*  Well, it's probably how your brain's firing.
*  Your brain has just like, brain is essentially just like a computer in a way.
*  Like there's a lot of calculations that are going on simultaneously.
*  A lot of sensors are being considered.
*  Different senses are affecting the way you view the world.
*  And I think it's very possible that you can have a situation where things just get a little wonky for a second
*  and you think, have I done this before?
*  Have I done it before?
*  But how?
*  Or, or, or, you have done it before.
*  And every time you do this, you try to do it better.
*  And you live the same life over and over and over again until you get it right.
*  A lot of people believe that.
*  That's a good theory.
*  It plays into what I'm going for here.
*  I had a moment in time where I had deja vu.
*  I'm not going to say where and when because I don't want anyone to interfere with it.
*  But I've never told anyone this before.
*  I had a place in time where I was walking.
*  I was going under a bridge.
*  A pigeon flew out.
*  Okay.
*  Right.
*  A child was laughing in the background.
*  You know, like a child, like hee hee, you know, like a giggle, a playground giggle.
*  And a red car went by and I was like, I've been here before, a place I'd never been.
*  So I documented the experience, the time, the place, and I've gone back to that same place for nine years
*  to the exact same place at the same time.
*  Check this out.
*  Red car goes by.
*  Bird flies out.
*  Pigeon.
*  Kid laughing in the background.
*  But this year, something different happened that I'd never seen.
*  A feather fell off of the bird when it flew out.
*  So check this out.
*  You see the feather?
*  Don't get ahead of me.
*  Well, the matrix must be real.
*  Well, hold on.
*  I got this examined.
*  I have a lot of friends in the science community.
*  I know a bunch of Scientologists and I had them analyze this.
*  Pigeon flew out.
*  Here.
*  I'm good.
*  This is a feather from a great auk.
*  Do you know what that is?
*  It's an extinct species of bird from South America.
*  Please.
*  That's okay.
*  Just put it down.
*  Well, I think you'd like to touch it.
*  No, I'm good.
*  So how does an extinct species of bird drop a feather from a common pigeon?
*  Who knows, man?
*  That's it?
*  That's the animal?
*  That's the auk.
*  Looks like that animal didn't really have feathers.
*  It did, believe me, and I'm holding one right here.
*  What, extinct 350 years ago?
*  Is that what it was?
*  Hmm.
*  Matrix.
*  Oh, from healthy to extinct in 350 years.
*  They probably taste delicious.
*  They're probably stupid and they taste delicious.
*  That's what happens.
*  Whoa, whoa.
*  The great auk.
*  Little cutie.
*  Can that thing even fly?
*  No.
*  Sounds like a bullshit story.
*  How does that feather get there?
*  Well, this is what I'm saying.
*  This thing lives near the ocean.
*  The matrix.
*  You just found a feather that maybe someone dropped.
*  It floated off of the pigeon for nine years.
*  Maybe not.
*  Maybe it just was near where the pigeon was and it was flying through the air
*  because someone had an auk, like taxidermy, in their apartment building,
*  and that feather just kept drifting away.
*  And just coincidentally, as the pigeon was passing, that feather was making its way.
*  Oh my God, look what fell off the pigeon.
*  An ancient, extinct auk feather.
*  But meanwhile, it was just someone who was in an apartment building with taxidermy of the auk,
*  and they had the window open, the fan on.
*  Touche.
*  You never know.
*  Could be magic, though.
*  I like what I'm hearing.
*  Do you think this is the matrix?
*  If this is a simulation, what does it say about your choice,
*  like how you've chosen to exist in the simulation?
*  I don't know that we have a choice.
*  You don't think so?
*  Well, the matrix is numbers.
*  It's mathematical.
*  So do we really have a choice?
*  Did we have a choice that we were conceived?
*  Did we have a choice that our...
*  We don't think we did.
*  But maybe we do.
*  Or maybe it's inevitable.
*  Maybe there's just this mathematical cycle of atoms and protons and molecules interacting with each other.
*  This is the way it's always going to go.
*  It's going to go this way, the same way, over and over and over again.
*  And the only thing different is that you get to learn from your past mistakes
*  at least some way in the essence of your being,
*  and do a better job of existing this next go-around.
*  I don't know that we have to do a better job.
*  I don't think we have a choice.
*  I think evolution just takes us.
*  We're just hanging on to bears tapeworms at this point.
*  Yeah, but if you live the same life over and over and over again,
*  you're going to go through the same nature interaction over and over again.
*  It's not going to be like a differently evolved world.
*  You're going to live the same thing over and over again.
*  If you thought about it, like you and I, how old are you?
*  Well...
*  I'm 56.
*  How old are you?
*  61.
*  Are you really?
*  Yeah.
*  For real?
*  Yeah.
*  You look really good.
*  Thank you.
*  You do.
*  You look really good, except the scars.
*  You're a little beat up.
*  I've been rolled by a gris.
*  We have gone through one of the weirdest lives.
*  And if the simulation is real, and if the simulation wanted you to go through
*  the most profound changes that human beings have ever experienced
*  in the time of their life, just in how people interface with the world.
*  You and I have done that.
*  We exist.
*  We were born in a time where there was no internet,
*  and you got your news from television,
*  and everybody had a sort of a limited understanding of the world.
*  You could bullshit your way through most things,
*  because nobody could Google you.
*  Nobody could get a book on you.
*  You couldn't just run to the library and find out if Mike was telling the truth
*  about his war stories.
*  You had to just believe people.
*  Yeah, the microfiche things.
*  Everything was possible.
*  The world was a different place.
*  Then there's answering machines and cell phones,
*  and then the internet comes along,
*  and now we're living in a fucking insane world where AI is about to take over.
*  If you were going to pick a timeline to go through if it wasn't real,
*  and you wanted the most profound adventure, you've chosen that.
*  You've chosen the most profound changes that people will experience
*  in a relatively safe timeline,
*  relatively safe in comparison to the Genghis Khan days
*  or the days of the Roman Empire.
*  Just relatively safe in comparison.
*  But profound changes for this moment,
*  and we're accelerating so rapidly, Joe,
*  that things are going to be at a whole other level quickly
*  where we're going to be looking in the rearview mirror and going,
*  Oh, yeah, AI. Remember that?
*  There's going to be something that takes us to the next level
*  and then another level after that.
*  We are going to transcend so far that I don't even know
*  what humans and humanity looks like in a thousand years, if not less.
*  I don't think it's even 50 years.
*  That's what's crazy.
*  You and I are living through the weirdest time ever.
*  Yeah, because it started like we kind of had in high school for us.
*  It was the Texas Instrument Calculator was the mind blower.
*  Then we got a fax machine like 15 years later.
*  And then we got the laptop, the home computer, and then the internet,
*  and that was again like a decade in between,
*  and cut to smartphones, and it's been about what, 15 years with them now,
*  and now AI, and it's just like everything's happening exponentially quicker.
*  I remember I was on news radio with Dave Foley in the 90s.
*  Dave Foley, he's a big computer, internet, technology nut.
*  He loves that stuff.
*  And at the time, he was the first person I ever met who had a laptop.
*  So he had a laptop back then, it was one of those Mac laptops,
*  black plastic ones back in the day.
*  And he had this app running in the background where it gave him constant news.
*  He's like, look, if I keep it connected to the internet, it constantly gives me news.
*  I was like, whoa, you get your news from the internet?
*  This is crazy.
*  So it's like all the news stories of world events.
*  And so when I look back now at how we're just inundated,
*  like constantly inundated with like world conflict stories, world events, world problems,
*  world environmental crises, world starvation, world floods,
*  like world volcanoes with lightning, like, oh, it's good, you never fucking...
*  I remember that moment, that very moment when I was looking at Dave's laptop,
*  and I was like, wow, the internet is just going to feed you the news in real time.
*  You don't have to tune into the news. You don't have to go buy a newspaper.
*  This was like this profound moment for me where I still look back at that day,
*  and I go, that was the first time I ever saw like a baby, a baby supercomputer.
*  Oh, look, it's a little baby, the news, the news on the laptop.
*  And ironically, you're on a show called News Radio.
*  Crazy. Very ironically. Very ironically. Yeah.
*  Yeah, I'm excited to see where it goes, because I think the next evolution of this could be
*  it could be tractor beams, it could be particle movers, it could be, you know,
*  as ridiculous as it sounds, the transporter beam on Star Trek.
*  I feel like, you know, maybe 50 years, maybe 100 years, people are going to look back and go,
*  wait, you went to a place called an airport? You got on a tube and flew 18 hours to Australia?
*  Like, I think we're going to be at a place one day where maybe they can rearrange our molecules
*  and particles and beam us. I feel like if we can imagine it, it's going to happen.
*  Yeah, I bet it's going to happen. I mean, isn't it funny that Star Trek figured that out,
*  but they didn't figure out computers and they didn't figure out cell phones.
*  They had walkie talkies. Remember? Kirk out.
*  Well, they had the communicators. Over. Yeah, but it was a walkie talkie.
*  Spock, I've got diarrhea, send me some Pepto Bismol immediately.
*  But it wasn't, you couldn't both talk. Like if you and I were on a phone call together,
*  what's up Harlan? Hey, what's up dude? It's like, hey Harlan, how are you? Over.
*  Yeah, and there was no video component. Idiots.
*  Those idiots didn't even have FaceTime. Dumb. They got to get back to the future.
*  They didn't have nothing. Dumbasses.
*  Yeah, remember that thing? Yeah, that twirly thing.
*  Look at that stupid piece of shit. It had an acid trip like kaleidoscope.
*  And who knows what those buttons are even for? They're not even labeled.
*  What if I find that thing on the beach? I know what to do with it.
*  I think it's an electric razor, if you ask me. I think it's straight bullshit.
*  Yeah, I think it's a garage door opener.
*  I like how it had to flip closed though. I used to love that about old phones, when you could hang up like that.
*  Oh, I love that. Snap. Shut the fuck up.
*  Fuck you. Yeah, like those razor phones. Shut the garage door.
*  I remember I had one of those razor phones, so I thought I was James Bond.
*  Yeah, you could express yourself with them.
*  But the razor phone was the shit. Yeah, what did that one do?
*  It was just this thin little beautiful piece of metal.
*  It had a terrible battery life, unfortunately, because most phones had insane battery life back then.
*  A phone would last for days. Right.
*  Because the phones now, they just have so much electronics and this beautiful screen and high resolution.
*  It's doing things. You're playing games on it. You're taking pictures.
*  Your battery, but still, your battery's good for a day. That was the shit.
*  I had one of those. I thought I was in space.
*  Well, I also like the little side saddle. Did you have the holster on your belt?
*  I tried that. I couldn't do it. I felt like such a dork.
*  Oh, I love that. And this is coming from a guy who wears a fanny back.
*  Yeah, right. And you like to play with guns. You have guns.
*  I don't play with guns, sir. But this phone right here, for me, was the fucking shit.
*  I could never imagine seeing somebody with one of those today.
*  I would be like, what are you doing with that thing?
*  But aren't they bringing them back?
*  They have a different one. But the new one is like a new phone. It's like a modern phone.
*  The new one folds. Yeah, but it has apps. It's essentially a regular phone.
*  But it does close and it's real slim. Look, it looks pretty similar.
*  I think you might have to get one. Would you do it?
*  I thought about switching to Android just because I don't like being trapped in the Apple ecosystem.
*  I don't like the idea of it. But Google does a lot of really shady stuff with different things they do that I don't like.
*  And one of the things they do is, like if you look at what was their most recent declaration,
*  they were talking about censoring things in a time of social problems. Remember that, Jamie?
*  They reserve the right to censor information under certain circumstances.
*  It had something to do with Google Ads, yeah.
*  There's things that I don't like in terms of search results, curation,
*  because that's the thing that Google does that Robert Epstein has been working on for a long time,
*  showing that, say if you Google a presidential candidate, if you Google a candidate that's Democrat,
*  you'll get, especially someone who they want to win, you'll get a lot of positive stories that come up first.
*  And you have to go deep if you want to find something about corruption or accusations or anything like that.
*  But if you Google Republican, it'll go right to that.
*  No, I'm not saying this is just an example. I'm not saying you could find that.
*  But his research shows this, and I'm doing a bad job of paraphrasing it because I don't remember exactly what it said.
*  But essentially his claim was that in curating search results, you can have an impact on elections.
*  In curating search results and putting positive things for the people that you want to be elected in the prominence of the search result,
*  if it's not an organic search result, if you actually are curating it, you can affect the way people feel about a candidate,
*  and that will affect the election results. And so that's an issue. That's Google.
*  So I have an issue with that, and Google is Android.
*  But I also have an issue with the Apple walled garden.
*  And I think there's a lawsuit going on right now about that where they're trying to get people to,
*  because of iMessage and FaceTime and all that stuff doesn't work on other phones.
*  FaceTime does sort of, but you have to take a few steps, and that's a new thing.
*  A new thing is if you FaceTime someone on an Android phone, they have to take a few steps to do it.
*  I wonder how that works. I've never tried that. Have you ever tried that?
*  I haven't tried it.
*  Let's try it right now. I'm going to FaceTime Brian Simpson.
*  FaceTime Brian Simpson.
*  I'm going to FaceTime OJ Simpson.
*  It gives you a link to send him or something, right?
*  Is he still alive?
*  Look, it said, I haven't seen OJ Simpson.
*  Wait.
*  Yeah, it's answering questions.
*  What the F?
*  It thought we were really asking about OJ Simpson.
*  Maybe I should reach out to him.
*  It didn't give me a link to send. Where's the link?
*  I think it's up on the top, like where the other buttons are.
*  No. Hold on a second. It didn't work.
*  So I have to, how do I do it if I want to send him a text?
*  FaceTime Brian Simpson.
*  FaceTime OJ Simpson.
*  Okay. Send.
*  What the F, you piece of shit?
*  Oh, wow.
*  What rate to Hertz rent a car?
*  Hold on. Be quiet for a second.
*  Well.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  Well.
*  FaceTime Brian Simpson.
*  Okay.
*  All right. It said join my FaceTime.
*  All right. I sent it to him.
*  Let's see if it works.
*  So let's see what he has to do.
*  Who's Brian Simpson?
*  He's a hilarious stand-up comedian.
*  He's performing tonight at the Comedy Mothership.
*  Oh, awesome.
*  He just released a special on Netflix that's amazing.
*  Wow.
*  Filmed at the Mothership.
*  So it says invite sent.
*  Maybe I should call him and tell him what's going on.
*  Who? Brian?
*  Yeah.
*  Okay. This is just holding me up here.
*  It's not doing, hold on.
*  Call Brian Simpson.
*  All right. Here we go.
*  Hello.
*  Hey, brother. It's Joe.
*  I'm on a podcast right now.
*  You're live on the podcast with Harlan Williams.
*  We were talking about how Apple keeps people from being able to use certain features like iMessage and FaceTime.
*  And I was saying that you can FaceTime someone that has an Android phone, but there's a bunch of steps they have to take.
*  I don't know how to do it.
*  So we're trying to figure out how to do it.
*  I'm going to FaceTime you right now.
*  Okay.
*  All right.
*  All right. I'll FaceTime you in like two seconds.
*  Bye.
*  Cool.
*  FaceTime Brian Simpson.
*  All right.
*  I sent him join my FaceTime.
*  Let's see how that works.
*  So here it goes.
*  We'll see how this feature works.
*  Now, I know all you Android dorks.
*  I know there's other shit that you could use to do this like WhatsApp.
*  And I guess you could use Instagram, right?
*  Don't people use Instagram for video calls?
*  This is not so fluid.
*  Now, if I wanted to FaceTime you because you're a little Apple fanboy over there, you're a little bootlicker.
*  Hell yeah, I am.
*  I could just FaceTime you and it would work instantly.
*  See, he's got this invite.
*  Yeah.
*  This takes so long.
*  Like it ruins the spontaneity about a fun FaceTime call.
*  A fun FaceTime call.
*  You're at a concert.
*  Dude, what's up?
*  Look where we are.
*  And ironically, his initials are BS because this is BS.
*  This is bullshit.
*  This is like straight bullshit.
*  Would you ever shoot your cell phone?
*  Like just to get your fresh?
*  I've shot a bunch of them.
*  Like with a full high powered rifle?
*  Yeah, we just take them out to the range and shoot hard drives and cell phones.
*  No.
*  That's a good way to get rid of stuff.
*  Boom.
*  300 wind mag at 100 yards.
*  Oh, it's amazing what it does to a cell phone.
*  Oh.
*  Do you line it up in a scope?
*  Of course.
*  Yeah, I can't see that far.
*  Wait, how far?
*  100 yards.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a video of it, I think.
*  Didn't Red Band have a video?
*  Yeah, we made a video.
*  Yeah.
*  Have you ever shot a machine gun?
*  Yes.
*  And?
*  A Lation?
*  It's kind of interesting.
*  It's scary.
*  It says I'm waiting to be let in.
*  Oh.
*  This piece of shit.
*  Yeah, I'm going to tell them to forget it.
*  Yeah.
*  Wait a minute.
*  What is it doing here?
*  It says join.
*  Is it working?
*  Waiting for others.
*  No, this is horseshit.
*  Waiting for others.
*  No, this is horseshit.
*  It doesn't work.
*  I'm telling them forget it, bro.
*  So, bitch.
*  See, but this is the thing that people are complaining about.
*  Yeah.
*  That it forces people to think you're a fool for having an Android phone.
*  So you just go out and get an iPhone, and iPhones have dominated the market because of that.
*  Yeah.
*  So like, I think the numbers are, with young kids, the numbers is like, it's something like
*  80-something percent of kids have iPhones.
*  Yeah.
*  So the kids that don't have iPhones, they get left out of iMessage group chats.
*  Yeah.
*  They get talked shit to.
*  Oh, what are you, poor?
*  You got an Android phone?
*  Yeah, it's a class thing.
*  It's a class thing.
*  It's weird.
*  It's a weird thing.
*  I don't like it.
*  What do you think the evolution of cell phones are?
*  Do you think it's like Neuralink, where we're just like, you know, we're thinking our communicative
*  thoughts?
*  Yeah.
*  What's your thought on that?
*  Yeah, 100%.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, that or a wearable, maybe something that like you wear, it touches your temples.
*  Right, because the concept that we're, like this goes back to what I was saying about
*  flight.
*  Like, wait, you guys carried these boxes around and held them to your head?
*  Yeah, well, I mean, just this alone was magic 100 years ago.
*  If you brought this 100 years back, people would think you're the craziest wizard.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I have the answers to all questions.
*  Yeah.
*  And they would say, oh my God, people in 2024 must be so smart.
*  And then he comes 2024 to like a MAGA convention.
*  You see Robert De Niro getting yelled at.
*  He's doing his fucking press conference.
*  He'll never leave.
*  What is this?
*  What's the point of that?
*  I don't know, but this is people in 2024.
*  Whereas if you gave this to people in 1924, they'd be like, there's no way everyone will
*  have the world solved.
*  Once they have these, oh my God, then they have all the information.
*  And then people will know exactly what everybody looks like.
*  There's no more catfish.
*  Still chaos.
*  And now there's filters that you could use where I, from just a small snippet of your
*  conversation on this podcast, I think they need about 30 seconds, 30 seconds of your
*  voice.
*  And then I could pretend to be you, just talk like this.
*  And the audience would see you with what you're wearing, the way your hair is, everything
*  in your voice.
*  So everything that I say, like me saying this right now.
*  It would be you saying this right now.
*  Your voice, your face, your body, everything looks like you.
*  All through AI.
*  Whoa.
*  So there's no fucking way to know what anybody is saying that's not true.
*  And then there's a big issue right now with celebrities, especially women.
*  They're making porns with them.
*  Oh, they're just change superimposing like celebrities face on to a...
*  Face swap with AI.
*  So this porn star is having sex with this person.
*  You face swap Natalie Portman or fucking Angelina Jolie.
*  And now you have a real, realistic looking sex tape of famous people getting fucked.
*  So I could see Judge Judy plowing the pizza boy.
*  Judge Judy.
*  Just sucking cock like it's going out of style.
*  Wow.
*  Like it's a closing sale.
*  Wow.
*  Imagine Judy Dent in a pool boy video.
*  Who's that?
*  Who's Judy Dent?
*  Remember from the British actress?
*  I do not.
*  Em from...
*  What's her name?
*  Dench.
*  Judy Dench.
*  Bench?
*  Dench.
*  Dench?
*  Well, there she is.
*  Imagine her in a pool boy.
*  Oh, she was hot when she was young.
*  She was so pretty.
*  No, I mean now.
*  But look at her when she was young.
*  She was so pretty.
*  Imagine her rubbing chlorine all over a pool boy.
*  Time is a ruthless bitch, isn't it?
*  She puts the net over his head.
*  I'm trying not to imagine.
*  I'm trying to power through this.
*  She's 89 years old.
*  Give the woman her due.
*  Give her her respect, son of a bitch.
*  How about I give her a check for cleaning the pool?
*  Wow.
*  Getting stuck in the dryer.
*  Whoa.
*  I can't help it.
*  I can't get out.
*  Pull the...
*  Pull the...
*  The stuck in the dryer is my favorite.
*  You've seen that?
*  The stuck in the dryer porn is my favorite because it's so ridiculous.
*  You can get out of the dryer like anyone can.
*  I love it when they pull their head out and there's a cling-free sheet on their head.
*  They got a mouthful of lint.
*  Looks like they've been blowing an elf.
*  I can't believe it.
*  I'm stuck in here.
*  Thank you for saving me.
*  You know what?
*  I tried the dryer sex once and I accidentally, I was so impassioned, I hit the tumble cycle.
*  Oh, wow.
*  And so imagine being in your woman and she starts swirling around and you're holding
*  on like a horse, a rodeo horse.
*  It was some of the best sex I've ever had.
*  Did you stay still while she spun?
*  She spun.
*  I just held on to her muffin top and we swirled around like...
*  Did you get any concussions?
*  She did.
*  Yeah.
*  Holy God.
*  A lot banging around in there.
*  Oh, her head came out.
*  She looked like this cauliflower.
*  But I had one of the best orgasms I've ever had in my life.
*  That's a one-time deal, right?
*  Not really.
*  It's hard to trick her into doing that again.
*  Well, a women-like adventure.
*  What's the weirdest place you've ever done it?
*  Your house.
*  That was you?
*  Wow.
*  I thought I heard that dog growling under the bed.
*  Yeah, I was doing it under the bed while you were on top of the bed to sleep.
*  Okay, pre-marriage, because I don't want to get you in trouble.
*  Where was the wildest place you...
*  We were only 15, remember?
*  Yeah, where did you do it?
*  Wildest place.
*  I guess in the woods when we were kids, there was nowhere to go.
*  So you'd go in the woods.
*  One time we got eaten up by mosquitoes, like our whole body.
*  Both of our bodies is covered in mosquitoes.
*  Because we were so retarded, we got naked in the woods in July in Massachusetts.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, but you're fucking 17.
*  You don't know what the hell you're doing.
*  You're crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Wild kids.
*  Not in the woods?
*  Yeah, well, there was always...
*  The woods were always there.
*  There was a place when you were kids you could just go to the woods.
*  Just bring a towel or a blanket or something.
*  Just go to the woods.
*  Yeah, but the woods are scary, because anything in the woods is scary.
*  Things in the woods become scary, even if they're not scary anywhere else.
*  Like a baby, a naked baby in the woods just staring at you.
*  It's fucking terrifying.
*  There's no other place where a naked baby is scary.
*  If you're walking down the street and you see a naked baby, you're like,
*  Oh my God, whose baby is this?
*  Does anybody know whose baby is this?
*  Hey, little guy, hold on.
*  And then you call the police, you pick up the baby.
*  In the woods, you're like, we're going to die!
*  It's a fucking naked baby just staring at us.
*  If it's hanging upside down from a red pine staring at you, that's pretty creepy.
*  Holding on by its feet.
*  Like a bat.
*  If you saw a baby in the woods just staring at you, you'd be fucking terrified.
*  Any other place.
*  So the woods are automatically scary.
*  And you're scared that you're going to get caught, so that's exciting.
*  We're not going to get caught.
*  Don't worry.
*  We're going to go deep in the woods.
*  What about in the city, though?
*  You ever do it in a crazy place in the city?
*  No, not really. You?
*  Sewers? You ever go in the sewer?
*  You ever go in a manhole?
*  Had a little fun on a ferris wheel once.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Were you worried you were going to be at the bottom and wouldn't be able to stop?
*  Well, that was cool.
*  We would time it so that when we came down, it was like hands off, and then we'd swirl.
*  So it was kind of this really fun sort of start and stop thing.
*  And then one time, I'm not kidding, the guy sort of recognized me.
*  And we were having the guy here, the carny who ran it, like when I got on, he was like,
*  Oh dude, I love you, right?
*  And so we were having so much fun, but we weren't finished.
*  And so he was letting everyone off.
*  I said, just leave us on, just please, Jen.
*  He goes, OK, I got you.
*  And we just finished swirling.
*  Wow. Congratulations.
*  Did you ever do it in the swirling teacups at Disneyland?
*  Imagine if you did.
*  Boy, imagine throwing up right when you come.
*  It'd probably feel amazing.
*  Because even though throwing up sucks, it feels amazing when you have to throw up and you finally do.
*  It's purging.
*  You know that feeling?
*  Last time I threw up was about a year ago.
*  And it was in the middle of the night.
*  I got up and I was like, I feel like I'm going to fucking puke.
*  I didn't feel good going to bed.
*  And in the middle of the night, I was like, whoa.
*  And I woke up and I went to the bathroom to pee or throw up.
*  And I was like, oh boy, they might both happen at the same time.
*  And I held the pee.
*  It just went, rah.
*  And then I peed right over my throw up.
*  I don't give a fuck, dude.
*  That's how wild that was.
*  I didn't even bother flushing it.
*  I just pissed on the throw up.
*  I'm like, what?
*  Just left it.
*  Surf and turf.
*  Just a little throw up.
*  Did you do the thing when you barfed, like right after you just curled up on the bathroom floor in the fetal position and felt the cool tiles on your naked skin?
*  No, I've never done that.
*  Me neither.
*  I do lay down on the bathroom floor sometimes when I get out of the sauna, though.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Because the tile floor, like right when you get out of the sauna, it's 185 fucking degrees or whatever it is.
*  I like to lay down that cool tile.
*  But you do the ice soaking.
*  Yeah, but I mean inside my house.
*  Inside my house.
*  I have a sauna inside my house.
*  I have one outside, too.
*  I'd love to come over later and sit in it with you.
*  Come on over.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's hang out.
*  We got one here, too.
*  We got one here.
*  I'd rather do the one at your house, I think, than we can have dinner, too.
*  Okay.
*  Well, do you want to sleep over?
*  I wouldn't mind.
*  I bet you do.
*  Well.
*  We're going to work out in the morning?
*  No.
*  You can.
*  You're going to get the cold plunge?
*  No.
*  Oh, come on.
*  I'd sit in ice cream.
*  In a hot day, the cold plunge feels good for about five seconds.
*  Yeah.
*  In a hot day, you get in there, you're like, oh, fuck.
*  I jumped in Lake Superior once, and it was one of those things, I probably stayed in
*  about five minutes, and I've never experienced it, but when I got out for about 40 minutes
*  after, I was shaking.
*  Like it was so cold.
*  Here's a question.
*  Lake Superior, massive lake.
*  Yeah.
*  Used to be a glacier, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Biggest of the Great Lakes.
*  Most of North America, at one point in time, at least half of North America was covered
*  by like a mile high sheet of ice.
*  Okay.
*  Right?
*  So you have this time period after the ice age where all that melts.
*  How the fuck do the fish get in there?
*  Yeah.
*  How the fuck did those fish get in there?
*  It's a mystery.
*  That's a really good question.
*  How those lake trout get in there in the middle of the country?
*  This big ass giant lake trout.
*  How the fuck did they get in there?
*  What did they just evolve once the water melted?
*  Were there seeds of the fish in the ice waiting to be melted?
*  For real though, if that's all ice, the fish ain't getting in there, how do they get in
*  the middle of the lake?
*  The lake is fucking huge.
*  It's filled with fish.
*  There is a possibility, it's an extreme one, but I'm trying to answer your question, that
*  a predatory bird like an osprey or a gull or some kind of fish eating bird...
*  Flies from the ocean.
*  Caught a fish in a local river or a nearby lake adjacent to...
*  Where are those nearby lakes if the entire continent is covered in ice?
*  The entire region, yeah.
*  Well, have you ever been to a farm or anything like that and sometimes they have those water
*  troughs that they leave out for the cows, but they've been abandoned?
*  Or you come to a place where there's like a little puddle in a field or something and
*  somehow there's fish in it and there's newts and there's aquatic creatures and you go,
*  how did they get here?
*  How did a newt get up an aluminum bin and get down into this ecosystem that's evolved
*  here?
*  It's fascinating.
*  Your question kind of raises the questions for all of creation.
*  We can look at evolution, we can look at the dawn of time, but really has it ever been
*  answered?
*  Not totally.
*  I mean, they don't have an exact time by time, like day by day timeline, but do they have
*  an answer to how fish got into the Great Lakes?
*  I can't believe I never asked that before.
*  I never even thought of it before.
*  My huge body of water, of course there's fish in there, but if the whole continent was covered
*  ten thousand years ago in ice, what the fuck happened?
*  Well you might have to say, okay, somewhere there was a tributary that came from the ocean.
*  No, it would be from north, it would be from up north.
*  Right, but we've gone from Hudson's Bay down into Superior and the ocean fish somehow-
*  Maybe they probably swim upriver from the warm areas.
*  Well that's what salmon do when they spawn.
*  I bet they swim up area.
*  That makes the most sense, how they got in those lakes.
*  So those lakes must be connected to rivers, right?
*  Oh yeah, they have to be.
*  They all are.
*  They probably swim up into the lake and then evolve to become like these big lake creatures
*  like lake trouts.
*  Yeah.
*  Because lake trouts are fucking huge.
*  Lake trout can get huge, yeah.
*  Oh man.
*  Yeah.
*  People ice fish them, that's like a big way of- they're fucking crazy looking.
*  So that thing, you don't really find them in the southern areas, right?
*  Those are a northern fish, aren't they?
*  Lake trout?
*  Yeah.
*  They're sort of a deep water, really cold fish.
*  They don't necessarily have to be way up north.
*  Right, so if they evolved, so these lakes and streams from the lower part of the country,
*  right?
*  So if you're talking about like New Mexico or something, some area that wasn't covered
*  in ice.
*  These things swim all the way up the river and then they evolve in this lake to become
*  bigger and to become adapted to the cold, deep water.
*  Different species, yeah.
*  This is the mystery of where we are.
*  Crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  How about sturgeon?
*  Sturgeon, they're like dinosaurs.
*  Where do those fuckers come from?
*  These things are what, a thousand pounds or more?
*  Huge.
*  They look like dinosaurs.
*  Prehistoric, yeah.
*  They look prehistoric.
*  Have you ever seen that thing that's in the Amazon?
*  It has essentially bulletproof scales.
*  Yeah, they're black.
*  What is it called?
*  I've seen it.
*  Arapaia?
*  Yeah.
*  What's up, Jimmy?
*  The way the fish got into the Great Lakes is a way deeper story than I've uncovered
*  so far, but the way salmon got there, specifically in the 60s.
*  People brought them there.
*  Yeah, a guy had to bring them there.
*  That makes sense.
*  Fishing became very popular back then, so there was a lot of dead fish swimming on the
*  shores for some reason, I was trying to find out.
*  Were there any fish in there before the salmon?
*  There had to have been.
*  As you were first asking it, I've seen this image recently.
*  The depth of Lake Superior specifically is very deep.
*  1,333 feet.
*  Fuck.
*  So there could maybe have been something under there waiting for the ice to melt that came
*  back up.
*  There is a bunch of stuff saying what he said too was fish eggs get dropped by other birds
*  and end up in the water.
*  I've got to think the river has a lot to do with it.
*  This is like, you can't go up Niagara Falls.
*  That's true.
*  Wow, you can't.
*  Good point, Jamie.
*  That's a very good point.
*  How the fuck does it get past those?
*  God damn it.
*  What a mystery!
*  Harlan, we've maybe cracked or uncovered one of the biggest mysteries in humankind, and
*  no one's talking about it, buddy.
*  Isn't that incredible?
*  Yeah, aren't you glad I showed up?
*  We busted it out.
*  We're the ones.
*  Imagine tomorrow, like front page of every newspaper, Harlan Williams and Joe Rogan pose
*  serious questions as to how fish got in the Great Lakes, and scientists are baffled.
*  And they all start talking to us, coming to us like, how did you guys realize that fish
*  had to get into the Great Lakes when the Great Lakes used to be covered in a glacier?
*  You guys are geniuses, untouched geniuses of nature.
*  And then maybe when Trump gets in for a second term, he appoints us to some sort of a nature
*  advisory board, and we give...
*  We could be the master ichthyologists.
*  Yes.
*  We could be the people telling everybody how to fix all these problems with animals and
*  people and...
*  But see, here's the other layer of this lasagna that we're not talking about.
*  You're talking about lake trout.
*  How about the Lake Superior probably has 60, 70 different species of fish?
*  I've fished Lake Superior.
*  I've caught whitefish.
*  I've got lake trout.
*  There's all kinds of fish in there.
*  Right.
*  By the way, I used to work on the shores of Lake Superior.
*  And there's a place...
*  You'd like this, because I know you like bears and you like guns and you like...
*  There's a...
*  Believe it or not, there's a place on the shores of Lake Superior called Nez Provincial
*  Park where it was such a desolate place that in World War II, they had a German Nazi prisoner
*  of war camp on the shores.
*  And the prisoners, it was so remote, no one could escape because they would have gone
*  into the Canadian wilderness.
*  But the German soldiers captured somehow a black bear and trained it to box.
*  They put boxing gloves on it and the Nazi soldiers, for entertainment purposes, would
*  box with this black bear.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  And they sunk a whole bunch of wartime vehicles in Lake Superior.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  How many bonnies you think are in Lake Superior?
*  I don't know, but they might be preserved.
*  It's so cold.
*  That's what I'm thinking.
*  If you went down.
*  Yeah.
*  If you dropped him all the way to the 1,300 feet, just this creepy skeleton with his 1970s
*  jeans on, bell bottoms.
*  He might not even be a skeleton.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  It's so cold, he might still have flesh and just be like your baby in the woods, just like,
*  Hi Joe.
*  Would you like a fresh cauliflower?
*  Don't you think something would eat him?
*  Maybe more lamprey eels.
*  There's things alive down there.
*  Lamprey.
*  You ever seen a lamprey?
*  Aren't they a saltwater creature?
*  No, freshwater.
*  They're in Lake Ontario.
*  Oh really?
*  Yeah.
*  I know they're clinging to the bottom of sharks a lot, right?
*  They feed off of what the shark...
*  Those are remoras.
*  Oh, that's right.
*  Remoras, by the way.
*  Is a lamprey similar to remoras?
*  No, a lamprey is one of the more horrific.
*  It has a round, it's like an eel with a round suction cup with circular, like buzzsaw teeth.
*  It affixes itself on the fish and slowly sucks their interiors out.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  If that was in a movie, you would say, Oh my God, glad that's not real.
*  That's like Dune, right?
*  That's like the worm in Dune.
*  There is a movie, what's it called?
*  Let me see that one where that dude's holding it again.
*  That's so creepy.
*  Yeah, the lamprey.
*  Look at that fucking mouth, man.
*  Well, what's amazing is it sucks your insides out and slowly eats you alive.
*  So it pulls the skin apart and then just sucks out all the organs?
*  No, it literally creates a hole.
*  Look at it bite in that dude's hand.
*  Yeah, it puts a hole in the fish and just stays affixed to the same spot and eats its
*  insides out.
*  They're older than dinosaurs.
*  Yeah.
*  Now they're in the Great Lakes.
*  That's crazy.
*  How the fuck did they get in there?
*  So that's one attached to a fish?
*  Yeah, that's on a lake trout right there.
*  Can you show me the photo?
*  Oh, so that's the hole where it was...
*  No, that's it hanging.
*  Invasive.
*  Oh, those are the ones hanging.
*  Yeah.
*  So you can see a hole where one let go and they just...
*  Click on that link, please.
*  ...consume the fish.
*  Where are they from originally?
*  It says it's an invasive species.
*  I don't know, maybe the Amazon?
*  Does it say?
*  Wow.
*  Right, right, but where are they from?
*  It says it's invasive.
*  It's a sea lamprey.
*  Yeah.
*  They're in the Great Lakes.
*  The sea lamprey is invasive and it can cause problems in local ecosystems.
*  It's a lot to do with its size.
*  Sea lampreys are big compared to native species, so it comes from the ocean somehow or another.
*  And they can live in fresh water?
*  That's crazy.
*  Well, apparently the girl, I think her name's Maria Bell, was the first person to ever swim
*  across Lake Ontario, and she had to swim through schools of those, apparently, when she swam
*  across Lake Ontario.
*  Whoa.
*  Oh my God.
*  Oh yeah.
*  They're the fuckers, grab a hole in your asshole.
*  Yeah, they're the perfect, they almost got asshole suckers for mouths.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, they're perfect.
*  I hate to see Demetri around one of those.
*  So in the 1950s, the US and Canada teamed up for population control measures and they
*  have worked several strategies, including traps to capture adult lampreys, lampricides,
*  poison, target sea lamprey larvae, and installing barriers or futactics to use.
*  Look at that.
*  Before working, what does it say?
*  Oh.
*  That's a good thing, left multiply, sea lampreys could significantly damage the region's $7
*  billion fishing industry.
*  Huh.
*  Lampreys.
*  Yeah.
*  Creepy little fuckers.
*  Yeah, and then the remora.
*  Look at how weird that thing is.
*  The remora has a suction cup on its head, so the top of its head is a suction cup.
*  Look at that.
*  And I was sexually assaulted in Florida.
*  I had been eating a bacon sandwich and spilled some on my lap and went swimming and that
*  thing sucked me for about an hour and a half.
*  Look at the top of its head.
*  Well, someone's not paying attention.
*  I'm paying attention.
*  Well, I had a sexual assault and you glazed right over it.
*  I didn't believe you.
*  Well, it's true.
*  It lasted too long.
*  If you said for like 30 seconds, I would have said, oh my God, that thing clung to his leg
*  for 30 seconds.
*  But maybe I wanted to last.
*  Remember you're talking to the dryer sex guy here.
*  Right, the guy with the baby and so on.
*  Do you know that the Spanish...
*  What does it say?
*  Suckerfish latches to swimmer?
*  Whoa!
*  Look at her.
*  She's hot.
*  But you know the Spanish fishermen, you know, there was a time when you could eat sea turtles.
*  And the remora will swim to whatever's moving because they feed off of...
*  They're like parasitic fish.
*  When the shark eats, they'll catch all the scraps.
*  So Spanish fishermen, to their ingenuity, they used to eat sea turtles and when they'd
*  catch a remora, they'd keep it alive in the boat.
*  And when they saw a sea turtle, they'd put it on their line, throw it in the water.
*  The remoras would go to the sea turtles, stick on the shell, and they'd reel in sea turtles.
*  Really?
*  Used to be able to eat them, yeah.
*  That's how they...
*  No, you're making this up.
*  No, that's for real.
*  This was in the past.
*  They clung to the sea turtle and that's how they pulled this.
*  So they used it like a magnet to get sea turtles.
*  You saw the size of the sucker on its head, right?
*  So it would stick to the sea turtle and then they could in essence pull in the...
*  Really?
*  Yeah, see there's one.
*  Wow!
*  Yeah, so if you want to go fishing for sea turtles later, let me know.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Some good sucking going on in the ocean.
*  They used to take the sea turtles and flip them on their back and put them in the bottom
*  of the ship.
*  And then when they wanted to eat one, they'd just pick it up.
*  Because when you flip them on their back, they can't turn over, so they'd just lay there.
*  And they could stay alive for a long time without food or water.
*  Yeah, because they're air breathers.
*  Yeah, so you just leave them in there until you want to cook one.
*  Yeah, throw a leaf over it.
*  Pick it up.
*  It's like fresh food.
*  I've seen a bunch of videos of people cooking and eating sea turtles in other countries
*  because there's some cooking show or fishing show where some guy went with them and you're
*  not allowed to do it, but you can be there while people are doing it.
*  If you're an American, you're not allowed to kill a sea turtle.
*  But in some parts of the world, like their local culture...
*  You know, like in some places, Inuits are allowed to eat whale.
*  They can kill whale.
*  They can kill walrus.
*  Seals, all that stuff.
*  So these people are allowed to kill sea turtles.
*  But there's something really disturbing about watching a sea turtle get hacked apart.
*  Yeah, because they're so gentle.
*  I know, and they're so like, what is happening to me?
*  Yeah, they're just like little dummies swimming around.
*  They're not like a fish.
*  Like a fish.
*  A fish is just like their eyes don't move that good.
*  They just move around a little.
*  You're so removed from me.
*  I'm going to cut your head off and serve you a sushi.
*  They're so sweet.
*  I was just in the Galapagos Island swimming underwater with sea turtles holding their
*  flippers.
*  Also...
*  So sweet.
*  That's cute.
*  Also, sea turtles...
*  Trying to seem tough, but...
*  Turtles are always good guys.
*  In movies and like, ninja turtles, they're the good guys.
*  Right?
*  Turtles are like your friend.
*  Yeah, they're buddies.
*  Yeah, they're your wise pal.
*  The turtles are never cunts.
*  It's never really a cunty turtle.
*  In like, movie depictions.
*  Yeah.
*  Can you think of a cunty turtle?
*  Uh...
*  God...
*  Remember that giant turtle that fought Godzilla?
*  And fire would come out of his shell.
*  There you go.
*  There's your example.
*  He would spin around.
*  What was his name again?
*  Cunty?
*  No.
*  I don't think so.
*  Well...
*  But like turtles, that's like one of those things that happens with people.
*  That's why people like, love bears.
*  Because you have teddy bears.
*  Yeah.
*  You have teddy bears, and you know, you got yogi, and you know, only you can prevent forest
*  fires, all that stuff.
*  Like, oh, bears are your friends.
*  They're sweet.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's what a great PR campaign.
*  These murderous assassins have pulled off.
*  Yeah.
*  Getting us to like, reintroduce them into areas where people are like, we're your friends.
*  They're not.
*  They're monsters.
*  Big ass monsters.
*  Yeah.
*  With a good PR campaign.
*  Other bears will eat you faster than they'll do anything else.
*  Here's a fact.
*  Owls are dumb.
*  I thought they were wise.
*  I did too.
*  I talked to a woman who trains birds, and she had all these different birds.
*  She had hawks, and parakeets, and falcons, and all.
*  She's like, owls are the dumbest.
*  There's only one animal dumber than them.
*  That's one of those big animals, one of those big birds, rather, that's dumber than them.
*  One of them big birds from Australia.
*  What are those things called?
*  Emu?
*  That's it.
*  That one's dumber.
*  Really?
*  She said that's the only animal that's dumber than an owl.
*  She's like, owls are so dumb.
*  I thought they were wise.
*  I had one booing outside of my house about two weeks ago, keeping me awake all night.
*  And I'm like, how do you deal with the wisest of all the birds, right?
*  So I go outside, I throw a Rubik's Cube up into the tree.
*  It comes back 30 seconds later, perfectly dumb.
*  So I don't think they're that dumb.
*  Wow.
*  Maybe you got an autistic kid living in your tree.
*  Johnny!
*  I'm trying to sleep!
*  Come down, Johnny!
*  He's up there counting out loud.
*  So check this out, Joe.
*  He's out there doing long math in his head.
*  He's up there eating celery.
*  Five thousand divided by sixteen.
*  He throws a beautiful mine.
*  He throws that Rubik's Cube.
*  He throws it back to you.
*  He keeps going on with his math.
*  I did do a movie once where I played a wizard.
*  And I had a Eurasian Eagle Owl.
*  I think they're the biggest of all the owls.
*  And they trained it to land on my arm on the big leather glove.
*  And I'd never worked with owls up close like that.
*  And the trainer, he was sitting like this with his talons.
*  And the trainer said, grab the back talon and pull it.
*  And I said, well, I don't want to hurt the thing.
*  He said, no, pull it.
*  So I grabbed the back and I gave it a tug and it didn't move.
*  And he goes, no, pull it as hard as you can.
*  And these are these big claws.
*  I grab it. I could not move it.
*  And he goes, this is what an owl's death grip feels like.
*  When it clanks onto something, it's over.
*  I could not believe the strength in that talon.
*  It was crazy.
*  Yeah, I mean, they're raptors.
*  They're just wild.
*  Their claws, when you see an eagle's claw, when they give you a close up,
*  it's like a human hand, but with spears at the tip of the fingers.
*  But I didn't understand the strength of them.
*  So strong.
*  It's just like clamped.
*  Much stronger than your hands.
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
*  Well, imagine what they do when they just snatch a salmon out of the water
*  and fly away with it.
*  Look at those things, man.
*  That's insane.
*  I mean, that is straight up dinosaur tools.
*  Look at that.
*  That's crazy.
*  And look at all the texture to it, all the muscles and tendons.
*  What a monster.
*  And way more powerful than you would think just by looking at it.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I actually, if you look at the claws of the osprey.
*  Look at that, owls.
*  Those are fake.
*  He's got two hands, bro. That's real.
*  No, those are fake.
*  No, that's the wise owl.
*  That's the real wise owl.
*  That can't be.
*  He reads books with those.
*  Yeah.
*  He's up there in the tree reading books.
*  I didn't even see the problem with it at first.
*  I was like, what's wrong with it?
*  Oh, yeah, okay.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Welcome to the internet.
*  But I was so shocked that owls are dumb.
*  Yeah.
*  Why did it?
*  Whoa.
*  Look at those claws.
*  Is that the Eurasian eagle owl?
*  Oh, my God.
*  Great horned owl.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Great horned owl.
*  Look at those things.
*  That's so amazing.
*  That's what took my chihuahua.
*  Did it really?
*  Yeah, I had a chihuahua and one of those bastards, because they're big too.
*  Oh, they're big.
*  Those are fairly big.
*  They get a lot of cats.
*  Imagine my little chihuahua getting picked apart by that.
*  Wow.
*  I have a friend and he was telling, I think Steve Rinell was telling us on the podcast,
*  was he, about the, like they found this one owl's nest and it was filled with like cats,
*  little collars.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Yeah, it was like 30 different cat collars.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Something like that.
*  Yeah.
*  They're like, what the fuck, man?
*  They're just snatching cats out of people's backyards.
*  Yeah.
*  And like I said, it's a-
*  Tabby.
*  Going for a nap.
*  Gone.
*  Gone.
*  Not even that sound.
*  If you hear this, if you're, oh.
*  Yeah.
*  You ever heard like the difference between the sound an owl makes when it flies?
*  They've done like these, like, they record the noise.
*  There is no sound.
*  It's insane.
*  It's silent.
*  When you see an hawk do it or an eagle do it, there's all this different, birds have
*  noise and then the owl makes like no fucking noise.
*  The aerodynamics of an owl, they're like stealth bombers.
*  Yeah.
*  Just silent.
*  You know, the other wild one is tuna.
*  When tuna go through the water,
*  they can go through the water to grab something,
*  and they don't even make a ripple.
*  Like when they go over the top of the water.
*  It's crazy, I watch video of it. It's bizarre.
*  Wait, when they jump?
*  No, when they're going through the top of the water.
*  They just slide through it like a knife.
*  Like a knife, yeah.
*  So that's a hawk.
*  Yeah.
*  Now watch the owl.
*  Shh.
*  Shh.
*  Shh.
*  Nothing.
*  Silent.
*  Silent, nighttime killer.
*  Nature man.
*  Dumbest shit. Big stupid head with giant eyes.
*  Dumbest shit. Just fucking killing
*  everything you can.
*  They're not that dumb.
*  They gotta be smarter than a woodpecker.
*  I think woodpeckers are way smarter.
*  Really? What about a blue heron?
*  I mean, they train a woodpecker, so this lady probably has a limited database to work with.
*  Everything she's got on her arm is like a raptor,
*  except for the owl.
*  Falcons, she said, are the hardest.
*  Hawks and falcons, she goes,
*  they just kill everything.
*  You let them go, they just go find things.
*  They'll kill squirrels. They just can't stop killing.
*  She goes, these things,
*  they're killing machines.
*  She goes, I let them go, they just find things and kill it.
*  Like immediately.
*  Find a bird, kill it. Fly up to the bird, kill it.
*  They come back to her, but they just go kill things first.
*  Oh, this is a trained falcon.
*  Yeah, they're all trained.
*  But it doesn't matter. If you let a hawk go,
*  hawks just go find something to kill.
*  What do I got to kill?
*  They just fly around like, oh, bird!
*  Boom, dead.
*  They're not even trying to eat it. Squirrel, fuck you, bam!
*  Kill that squirrel. So sport killing.
*  Sport killing. They're just designed to kill.
*  Because not a lot of animals do that.
*  Some animals can't help themselves.
*  Lions do it to hyenas.
*  Yeah, but I bet that lion did it to that lady in that car.
*  I bet she wasn't eating her.
*  I bet that was a little bit of sport.
*  There's another old video where some Danish guys
*  going through a lion safari
*  with his wife and kids.
*  And he got out, he was with his camera.
*  Oh no!
*  And literally the kids and the wife,
*  you see them in the car going berserk,
*  and his legs are kicking in the air
*  and the lion just came and devoured him
*  right in front of the wife and kids.
*  Like the idiot got out.
*  Some people are just fucking stupid.
*  That's Darwin, right?
*  That's the whole idea.
*  Those people are not supposed to make it.
*  Yeah.
*  You're not supposed to make it.
*  But they've already bred.
*  That's the problem.
*  At least the kid has the benefit of seeing his dad get...
*  Like my dad was so dumb.
*  You can have a dumb dad and get through things
*  and be a different person than your dad was.
*  And if you're a dumb kid
*  and your dad is dumb as shit,
*  and your dad gets out and gets eaten by a lion in front of you,
*  that has a profound effect.
*  I gotta be honest though...
*  Not even saying that kid's dumb.
*  Maybe the kid's a genius.
*  You could have a genius kid, be stupid.
*  I gotta be honest though, Joe,
*  in this world we live in
*  where humans expire
*  primarily in a hospital bed
*  or at home
*  and around their loved ones
*  with a disease, with whatever, cancer,
*  I really would rather die
*  like jumping a lion.
*  Like, you know, at the family function
*  how did he die?
*  He attacked a lion.
*  He went out on his shield.
*  Yeah, you went out on your shield.
*  Yeah.
*  I want to noble the death of a warrior.
*  Right?
*  But going back to that story,
*  this is gonna sound ridiculous.
*  No way.
*  Yeah.
*  But going back
*  to the story where I told you
*  I saw the lion when my hand was shaking,
*  there was that terrified part of me,
*  this is for real,
*  there were two male lions,
*  no one else, I'm in the middle of Africa,
*  part of me wanted to jump out
*  of the truck
*  and just run at the lion
*  and attack it
*  knowing that I'd die,
*  but knowing that it would be
*  the most glorious death
*  of a man with courage
*  or stupidity,
*  but at least I would die
*  in a fashion where
*  spectacular way.
*  In the real world, organic,
*  nature, man versus beast,
*  beast versus beast,
*  because I don't like to think of us as superior
*  to other creatures, but
*  it just, that actually popped
*  into my head. I thought
*  I don't want to expire
*  in the leukemia ward,
*  I don't want to be a hospice.
*  I've lived a good life,
*  so imagine I just run at a lion
*  and in that last moment
*  I get to see the shock in its face
*  of a human, daring
*  to jump on it and grab its
*  and they would have been on me in a second,
*  but I don't know, is that weird?
*  Like have you ever thought how you want to die?
*  Well if you're going to die,
*  especially if you're older
*  and you know it's soon,
*  that's a good way to go.
*  Just run at that lion.
*  Have you ever thought about that?
*  No.
*  Would you be fine just
*  expiring in a hospital bed?
*  Yeah, that's better than being torn apart
*  in front of your family.
*  Yeah, I'm not saying
*  do it in front of your family.
*  No, not in front of your family, but if you just had
*  one on one moment.
*  Let's say you're out hunting a grizz
*  and one day you just go,
*  you know what, you put the
*  rifle down and you just run
*  at him and go,
*  this is how I want to go.
*  Punching, punching a grizz
*  in the face.
*  Knowing you're going to die, but you go out
*  in that wild...
*  Punching a grizz in the face is like
*  an ant punching you.
*  It's like being attacked
*  by a kitten with no claws.
*  It is, but you get that moment
*  of being a man,
*  of feeling that power.
*  You'd rather just have a heart attack.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a stupid way to die.
*  I mean it's one thing if you get
*  attacked by an animal when you're
*  out in the woods.
*  It's like, hey, this is the price you pay for being in nature.
*  But see, that's the thing,
*  they attack us, why can't we attack them now?
*  Flip it around.
*  I'd like to.
*  Maybe I'm even inviting you
*  to come with me to do it.
*  If you ever find out that you're going to die and that's how you want to go,
*  I'll go. You'd come with me? Yeah, definitely.
*  I'll bring a rifle in case you change your mind.
*  As you're running like,
*  Joe, I changed my mind!
*  Boom! I'll have my crosshairs on him.
*  You wouldn't run to the animal with me?
*  No. No, I'll be there to watch.
*  You want me to?
*  Yeah, I'd love that. Okay.
*  It'll be a special moment with Cher.
*  I'll be there when you
*  pass over to the next stage of life.
*  But you gotta do me a favor.
*  If heaven's real, if there is an afterlife,
*  whatever it is, just let me know.
*  Come back and tell me.
*  Come in a dream. Tell me in a dream.
*  Leave out a dream of someone who died
*  and it seemed like super realistic.
*  Yes!
*  I think I have.
*  What was it?
*  It might have been my dad.
*  Yeah, I just remember being
*  really sad like he's gone
*  and there was like this wave of emptiness.
*  Because my mother did die.
*  And are your parents still with us?
*  Yes.
*  So when my mother died,
*  this hole formed in my heart.
*  It literally felt like a hole.
*  And it can't close.
*  I can come to
*  peace with it.
*  I can be at harmony with the fact
*  that she's gone.
*  And I wasn't even super close with my mom,
*  but the hole that got left in my heart
*  was like,
*  if I focus on it,
*  I can feel it immediately.
*  And it's that
*  connection to the mother,
*  the person that brought you
*  into this world, you know?
*  It's really, really powerful.
*  And so in the dream, what happened with your dad?
*  I can't remember. It's foggy.
*  What I remember more than the actual
*  moment is that feeling.
*  That feeling of emptiness.
*  That, oh, they're gone.
*  Gone forever.
*  And it was really
*  sort of this sad, crushing
*  feeling on my soul.
*  It's powerful.
*  I had a dream after Phil Hartman
*  died.
*  And it wasn't that
*  long after his death.
*  And in the dream,
*  I ran into
*  him, and it was very realistic.
*  Because we were outside,
*  and he had like one of those
*  folding lawn chairs.
*  And it was on the ground.
*  And I said,
*  I said, hello?
*  And he was
*  explaining to me that him and his
*  wife had worked it out.
*  You know, this is after his wife killed him.
*  You were right there too, right?
*  I wasn't there when it happened.
*  No, but you were working the show when it happened, right?
*  Yeah.
*  And he
*  laughed about it. Like, yeah, we
*  had a lot to work through. But we're good
*  now. Something along those
*  lines. And then he sat down on the lawn
*  chair and like fell
*  backwards. Like it stumbled backwards.
*  And then I looked and he was
*  gone. It was really
*  weird. And then I realized
*  it was a dream. And then I woke up.
*  But I remember thinking, like in the moment, that seems
*  so realistic.
*  He was telling me he's okay.
*  I tried to get him
*  to divorce that lady a bunch
*  of times while I was working with him.
*  Because they would fight, like crazy
*  fights where he would just disappear for a couple.
*  He would leave the house. And he was telling
*  me he wanted to get divorced. But he didn't want the lawyers
*  to take a third. Because it's like
*  I was like, just give it. Third? I'm about a half.
*  No, no, no. It's
*  two thirds. So the lawyer takes a third.
*  This is what he was telling me. He's like, I go, just
*  give her half. You're always going to make money. Just get out.
*  Be free. Just be
*  you know. And he was terrified
*  of that. He was terrified of leaving. And so
*  when he finally decided to leave, she murdered him
*  in his sleep. She shot him and then she
*  shot herself. And my friend was actually
*  my friend who was a cop was actually
*  there when she shot herself.
*  Oh, so that happened when the
*  police approached the house. Yes.
*  Oh, wow. Yeah.
*  The police broke into the house to
*  try to save the kids and she shot herself.
*  The kids ran away from
*  their mom, he told me. So he
*  I hadn't done stand up in
*  two weeks after the murder. I was just
*  I just couldn't imagine
*  anything being funny.
*  And then I decided two weeks later to try to go to the
*  comic store. So I'm at the
*  gas station. While I was at the gas station,
*  my friend who was a cop was there.
*  And I was like, hey, what's up? How you doing? He goes,
*  how you doing? You good? I go,
*  yeah. He goes, you know, I was there. I go,
*  really? And then he told me the whole story about how
*  he was there and they saw the mom
*  in the bathroom with the gun.
*  And the kids ran away from
*  the mom when the cops broke down the door. Because the
*  cops saw her in the bathroom
*  with the gun. And a lot of
*  times in murder suicides, the
*  mother will kill her children too. Yeah, of course.
*  And so they were, she was in there with
*  the gun talking to the kids. And the
*  kids freaked out. And then when they
*  broke down the front door, the kids ran
*  away from the mom and she just blew her brains out.
*  The only good side
*  is they didn't see her do that, I'm
*  guessing. I'm hoping they didn't say that.
*  There's no good side. I mean, there's no good
*  side. You lose your mother and your father
*  in a murder homicide in one night and you're like,
*  what?
*  I mean, there's no good side. With your
*  intuition, like obviously
*  you were advising Phil to get away.
*  Yeah. Was there ever
*  a foresight in your head that
*  she would murder him?
*  Wow. No, no, no, no, no.
*  Isn't that funny how we just
*  don't know people? First of all, she
*  was also on Zoloft and cocaine.
*  And the family won
*  some sort of a settlement with Zoloft.
*  Not much, but you,
*  there's instances where people
*  mix Zoloft with cocaine that they
*  have psychotic reactions.
*  And I suspect that's
*  what was going on. And she was,
*  they hated each other.
*  They loved each other and they hated each
*  other. It was one of those deals.
*  She would insult him publicly.
*  It was rough, man.
*  And, you know,
*  I was just saying, like,
*  you're a great guy. Like, you don't need
*  to be going through this. You need to
*  get divorced and have,
*  you know, share custody of your kids and
*  try to set an example
*  and just not, you can't do this.
*  Like, the fighting was so bad.
*  It was, and he hated it.
*  He didn't want to be married to her. He was
*  stuck. And
*  I told him, like, you can't
*  just stay stuck and just let these circumstances
*  overcome your existence.
*  No matter how hard it is, you
*  have to push through. So we had a break
*  or we were done filming for a bit
*  until we went back for the next season.
*  And
*  one day I woke up and someone
*  called me and told me. And then I
*  saw it on the news and it's just like, what?
*  And then everybody was calling everybody.
*  We all got together.
*  We were like, fuck.
*  It's just so hard
*  to believe. It doesn't make sense. It's like,
*  how? Was he
*  your buddy? Like, were you friends with him
*  off set? Like, did you chum around
*  and stuff? Yeah, he actually took
*  me up in his plane once
*  to find where I wound up
*  buying a house because I was
*  he goes, one of the cool things about
*  flying is like, I can show you
*  because he had just got he had gotten his pilot license
*  while we were on the show together. Yeah.
*  And so he
*  was always practicing that he bought one of
*  these single engine planes. It was pretty cool.
*  And so he said, you want to come up for a flight?
*  I'll show you around. I'm like, yeah, let's do it.
*  And so we flew around
*  the valley and showed me all these
*  different areas. It's like he was
*  a great guy, man.
*  Did you? Sweet, sweet guy.
*  Given the turmoil in his
*  relationship,
*  were you privy to the knowledge
*  that they had a gun in the house?
*  No, no, no idea. Because you gotta
*  when you're going through something bad with
*  a spouse, I don't think it's
*  good having a gun in the house because someone
*  could flip like that, you know?
*  I guess. Yeah, that's a horrible thing to think. But I
*  don't even know who's gun it was.
*  I don't know anything. Yeah. I don't know if it was her gun.
*  I don't know if he knew about the gun.
*  I don't know.
*  Damn. Yeah. But the dream
*  was so strange because the dream was like him
*  letting me know he's fine. He was Phil.
*  He was laughing. He was like
*  he made some sort of a joke about
*  his wife killing him. And
*  we got through that now. And then he sat down
*  on the lawn chair and fell backwards.
*  It slipped back. And like, I
*  think I looked down at the ground and I looked at
*  him and he was gone.
*  And then I was like, oh, this is a dream.
*  And then I woke up.
*  Did you feel like closure
*  to a degree? Yeah, weirdly, weirdly.
*  It felt like it was him letting me know not to
*  freak out about it. Yeah, like let it go.
*  Yeah. But you're always
*  going to freak out about it. You freak out about the kids.
*  The kids is the big one.
*  You just can't imagine what it'd be like
*  if that was you, if you were a kid.
*  And then all of a sudden your mom shoots your dad
*  and then shoots herself. And then it's public.
*  It's not just that it's
*  this thing that you have to deal with.
*  It's the thing that everybody wants to talk
*  to you about because the whole world knows about it
*  because he was a famous guy. Yeah.
*  You know. Well, not only famous, but
*  what really, he was loved,
*  but what really kind of
*  was hard to get your head
*  around is you have this
*  guy who's an extreme comedy
*  force, right? Yeah. And you
*  don't think of joyous
*  sort of comedy, people that
*  elicit laughter
*  and violence like that. Right. Right. Right.
*  Of course. And so the fact here was this funny sort
*  of ha ha ha guy that
*  brought so much laughter and then
*  that kind of ending, it's like
*  it just doesn't fit. But not only
*  that, it's like when does the wife kill the husband?
*  With a gun? How often is that? That's so
*  rare. And execution style in the
*  sleep. While they're sleeping. Yeah. Oh my God.
*  What must have been going through
*  her head too? So loft and cocaine.
*  Yeah. What's so loft?
*  It's an antidepressant SSRI.
*  Oh. Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah. Google the results
*  of side effects of mixing
*  Zoloft with cocaine.
*  I think there's a few
*  psychiatric medications
*  that if you mix with alcohol
*  or if you mix with cocaine, you
*  get really crazy behavior.
*  Like people just go off the fucking
*  rails. Yeah.
*  I don't know even
*  how much control they have. I don't know what
*  that feels like. Like what does that feel like
*  when you're on Zoloft and cocaine? You might be
*  fucking a raving maniac.
*  Yeah. You know?
*  Just that name. Do you got anything on that?
*  Zoloft.
*  Yeah. Like just that name sounds like
*  it's crazy time. Sounds like it's
*  from the Star Trek. Yeah, it sounds like
*  one of the planets they landed on, right?
*  Yeah. Zoloft is that comforting.
*  The Zolofts are here.
*  I wonder if they named it that to make it seem like
*  it's super advanced. Like you're going to take
*  Zoloft. Oh, it's fucking super advanced.
*  It just sounds like nutty time.
*  That's going to fix it. Yeah.
*  That's going to fix it. Look, if there was
*  a legitimate happy pill that worked
*  like that with everybody, that gave you
*  sort of like a low dose of MDMA
*  all throughout the day,
*  it's probably a good thing for everybody.
*  As long as there's no side effects.
*  I'm mixed on that. Yeah?
*  Because I think we
*  were bioengineered
*  to have
*  what we have.
*  On a daily basis, if you
*  start tinkering with what
*  the structure was,
*  how it was already the architecture
*  of the structure,
*  I feel like it's not maybe
*  necessarily a good thing.
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  ...
*  syndrome, they were cut down, they left us with who knows what else to offer us.
*  You know, like so many untold jokes, stories, moments, like Phil Harman was obviously multi-talented
*  as an actor too.
*  He was an artist as well, he did album covers.
*  Like to see what would still come, because I think, didn't he get killed in his late
*  thirties?
*  No, he was in his forties.
*  Forties, so it's more to go.
*  I don't think he even made it onto Saturday Night Live until he was in his late thirties.
*  The thing of him is like he was a grinder for so long and he was so talented and he
*  just didn't make it until he did.
*  And then everybody was like, oh my god, this guy's amazing.
*  He was fucking great on news radio too.
*  Such a good comedic actor, so funny man.
*  So good at delivering a line, like ugh, such a professional.
*  And it was interesting because he came over from Saturday Night Live, which is like this
*  really competitive, like shitty environment.
*  They snipe at each other and do terrible things to each other behind the scenes.
*  They do.
*  Yeah, he told me it was terrible.
*  And so when he came to news radio, to the sitcom, which was the opposite, everybody
*  was very loose, everybody was silly, we'd all go out drinking together, it was a good
*  time.
*  There wasn't any weird shittiness.
*  Oh good.
*  And he had to adjust.
*  So he would tell me about it.
*  He used to like to smoke a little weed.
*  So I'd hang out with him and he'd smoke weed.
*  This is back when I wasn't smoking weed.
*  And he'd smoke a little weed, we'd talk about stuff and just like, you know, like he hated
*  being there.
*  It was just all backstabbers.
*  Yeah, I've heard that story at SNL.
*  Yeah, they'll steal your ideas for your sketches.
*  Jim Brewer had horrible stories about that.
*  He had sketch ideas and he'd put them in like this spreadsheet and they could read the spreadsheet
*  of what you were going to do these sketches on.
*  So other senior writers would steal those sketches and say, we're doing something on
*  them.
*  Yeah.
*  And just like, fuck you, man.
*  Yeah.
*  It was just like this constant battle.
*  And he said he had it with cast members, he had it with writers.
*  And so Phil was like, ugh.
*  That's not conducive for comedy.
*  That just.
*  The worst.
*  Yeah.
*  So worse for comedy, but that's like that really weak man, like backstabbing shit when
*  they get power that happens when they have too much power unchecked and no one's watching
*  them and they get away with things like stealing younger writers premises and it's all dog
*  eat dog.
*  Everybody's just trying to get to the top.
*  That's always been a part of stand up.
*  Always been a part of comedies, like people stealing people's bits and the famous person
*  steals them and the unfamous person's fucked and destroys their lives.
*  Like we've seen it happen before.
*  Has anyone ripped you off ever?
*  Yeah, sure.
*  Bunch of times.
*  Yeah.
*  I've confronted people and they told me they wouldn't do it again.
*  Then I heard they were doing it again.
*  Like there's certain people that have always been Buccaneers.
*  They've always been joke Buccaneers.
*  You know, it's a pro.
*  And you know, they don't have any friends.
*  Those people, they sometimes have like a vampire familiar opening act.
*  So this opening act will go with them and they'll steal bits from them too.
*  There was a bunch of guys that got away with that before the internet rolled around.
*  There was a predatory type of comedian that would just poach other people's premises and
*  sort of rework them.
*  They didn't have any, there was nothing that they did that was creative on their own.
*  Everything was derivative of somebody else's work.
*  Everything.
*  I always heard, and I'm sure he could do anything he wanted on his own volition, but I had always
*  heard stories that Robin Williams was that guy.
*  Did you ever hear anything about that?
*  Yeah, I heard a lot of stories that he was that guy.
*  Yeah, and I think Robin Williams was so like part of that manic sort of style.
*  It's like this constant need to have a bit about anything that you're talking about ever.
*  And killing, I think, was more important and filling that hole inside of him was more important
*  than anything.
*  And so he would just do other people's stuff if he didn't have anything to say.
*  Did he get confronted by other comedians?
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  There was a lot of stories.
*  Kinnison got mad at him.
*  Oh really?
*  He stole from Kinnison?
*  Yeah, he stole from everybody.
*  He stole from a lot of people.
*  So it is true.
*  I'd always heard that.
*  Yeah, it's true.
*  If you ask any of those comics from back then, there's always instances of Robin going on
*  a talk show and doing your bit or going on this and doing your bit.
*  Doing your bit at a club.
*  With him, do you think it was because he was just so spontaneous?
*  He would just like puke it out?
*  There's no way.
*  I think he wanted to kill more than he wanted to be ethical.
*  So at any cost, I will kill.
*  Especially back then when no one was really watching you other than comedians.
*  Even up into the 2000s, the Mancia thing happened in 2007, right?
*  Even then, they were more willing to side with someone who they thought was more profitable
*  than the truth about what is this person doing and how are they getting this material.
*  This is pretty clear that they're plagiarizing.
*  If it's any other form of entertainment like music, they'll bring it to court and you lose.
*  And then all the money from those songs has to come to the original person because you
*  copied their song.
*  That's a classic thing.
*  Happens in literature all the time.
*  That woman who was the president of Harvard got busted plagiarizing.
*  She's not a president of Harvard anymore.
*  There's consequences always, but in comedy, it's always been self-policed.
*  And so it's a weird thing, that thing that people do, where they try to pawn off other
*  people's bits as their own.
*  It's a vampire thing because you're around all these creative people and you're just
*  stealing a little bit from this guy and a little bit from that guy and people are scared
*  of you.
*  Did you ever put a guy up against the wall?
*  No, I didn't have to do that.
*  How come?
*  Because I just said things.
*  Like you just verbally confronted...
*  Don't do my fucking material anymore.
*  You know that's my material.
*  Just like that.
*  And they're probably still going to do it unless you want to hurt them.
*  But it's like the thing about those people is they always get caught and when they get
*  caught everything after that sucks.
*  This is how you know if a thief is legitimately a thief.
*  If they're being unjustly accused, they're always going to come up with new material.
*  They're always going to be creative.
*  They're always going to have new great jokes because they're actually writing and working
*  on it.
*  But if it's true, what you see is an initial special or something or a few things they
*  do that are really funny.
*  And then you see this massive drop off in the concepts that they talk about, the irony
*  that they discover.
*  They don't have any legitimate points where you're like, wow, that is crazy.
*  There's none of that.
*  It all goes away.
*  And it becomes almost like a person doing an impression of the original successful person
*  because they have no creativity.
*  Now they're exposed.
*  So now they have to be really careful.
*  So you see that with every thief.
*  You see a couple early big specials or something.
*  And then you see massive drop off and terrible performances after that.
*  It's because they're not real.
*  They're parasites.
*  That's what they are.
*  They're vampires.
*  And they're stealing from artists.
*  They're tolerated a lot of times because they're very successful.
*  And one of the creepy things they do is they start hiring people to work for them.
*  Like they'll have a television show or something.
*  They'll hire legitimate people to work for them.
*  And those people now become like, they become like confidants.
*  And so they kind of keep it under wraps.
*  They try to defend that person publicly.
*  It's a very slick PR move for scumbags.
*  And some of those people working for them could be writers that will steal for them
*  too on their behalf.
*  That becomes a problem too.
*  One of the things that we noticed in the early days of the store is that the guys who are
*  thieves, their opening acts would become thieves.
*  Because even if the opening acts had potential, and some of them got out of it and actually
*  became like legit comics eventually, but they were seeing the shortcuts that this guy was
*  taking.
*  They were seeing this guy driving a Mercedes and they're like, I want to take shortcuts
*  too.
*  This is how you do it.
*  If you want to get by, this is my mentor.
*  If that's your mentor, if your mentor is a buccaneer.
*  And you're like, okay, I guess this is a fucking, I thought it was an artist.
*  I guess it's a dog eat dog world.
*  Eventually I'll stop stealing, but right now I've got to make it.
*  Bad approach.
*  Crazy.
*  Kind of crazy.
*  Did anyone ever approach you and say, hey Rogan, that's my bit?
*  No.
*  I have had people approach me where I know that it wasn't their bit and I know they were
*  trying to steal a bit.
*  Oh really?
*  One of the things that thieves will do is say, I actually do a bit on that too.
*  And you're like, that's really interesting because I've been doing this bit for two years
*  and you've seen me do comedy.
*  So what do we do in here?
*  There's a thing they do to let you know, hey, I didn't steal this from you, but I have a
*  bit on that too.
*  But you kind of did, didn't you?
*  Yeah.
*  That little kind of poke the cage.
*  And then there's also public events, some big thing that happens.
*  Everyone's going to have a bit on it.
*  Like the submarine explosion.
*  You can't say, hey, I do a bit on the submarine.
*  The border wall.
*  Yeah.
*  Everybody's got a bit on the border wall.
*  This is like, there's certain things where it's just, you know.
*  But you just know, we know who's writing.
*  We see them.
*  We see them go up.
*  If you go to the mothership on any given night, someone's going to do a joke to the bombs.
*  And then that joke, maybe next time they'll tweak it.
*  Maybe they come up in the green room.
*  This many times has happened.
*  One of us will say a joke.
*  I'll say a joke.
*  I'm like, this joke is just fucking, I can't go anywhere with it.
*  I know there's something there, but I can't.
*  And we'll fuck around.
*  We'll bounce off each other.
*  We'll network.
*  And then someone will go up with the version of it that's tightened up and then it starts
*  killing.
*  Like, we got it.
*  It works.
*  And so it's like this cooperative project.
*  But it's just, if you're not doing that, then you're not creating new material because
*  new material is never perfect.
*  It's always, sometimes it is.
*  Sometimes you have a bit.
*  Every now and then.
*  Every now and then.
*  Came to you and it's hilarious right away.
*  And it kind of stays in that same form.
*  But then a lot of times it's like, you know there's something there, but you don't know
*  how you're going to extract it.
*  Yeah.
*  Some of my favorite moments is I'm one of these guys, I don't know why I do this.
*  I think it's for the thrill of the kill.
*  But I love to go to the show early, like at the store or whatever.
*  I'll go like, you know, two comics early and I'll sit in the back.
*  And I don't know what my opening bit's going to be.
*  And I realize those two comics have between them about, I don't know, 25 minutes.
*  They're doing 12 minutes each.
*  And I go between them and me going up, I gotta come up with my opening bit.
*  And I'll create it as I'm in the back of the room.
*  I call it kind of, sort of like swimming, you know, reaching for air when you're drowning.
*  Right, well you know you have to say something.
*  I have to do it.
*  So it forces your brain to come up with something funny to say off the top.
*  Right.
*  And again, the opening bit is always the hardest.
*  So if you can lay a new bomb as your opening bit that you just came up with, I love doing that.
*  That's a great way to put yourself under pressure.
*  Oh, I love it.
*  I love it.
*  Have you done Bottom of the Barrel yet at the Mothership?
*  We did it last night.
*  Next time you're in town on a Tuesday night, Brian Simpson, who we just called.
*  Oh, are you reaching the bucket?
*  Yes.
*  Yeah, I did it last, about a month ago.
*  That's the best.
*  Your back is against the wall.
*  Shane and I did it last night for a half an hour.
*  We do it together sometimes.
*  Oh, wow.
*  So Shane and I went up at the end of the show.
*  Oh my god, we had so much fun.
*  That's it, it's fun, man.
*  We had so much fun.
*  It was so much, we're laughing, we're laughing so hard.
*  I'm laughing at him, we're laughing at each other, we're laughing at the audience, the
*  audience is laughing.
*  It was like such a party because they know we're just pulling these things out.
*  Yeah, you pull out words, right?
*  Yeah, you pull out words.
*  You got it, oh yeah.
*  It was cool as a team thing too because sometimes he's ranting about something, we're all laughing,
*  and I'll just, while it's happening, I'll pull in the bucket, try to find another good
*  one.
*  What's the next one going to be?
*  So we got one on deck.
*  Wow.
*  But it's like having that thing where you're forced to come up with something funny in
*  the moment, it's a good little exercise for creativity.
*  Yeah, and what I'm getting at too is when it hits, when you do that, it's kind of like
*  a 40-60 ratio a lot of the time.
*  Right, 40% success.
*  But when you get that one that you just came up with and it's 100%, maybe even 110, they're
*  rare but it's like, oh yeah.
*  Did you see the Andrew Schultz thing that he did about Los Angeles where he's like,
*  you know, everybody's saying that you guys are a bunch of drug addicts and perverts and
*  psychopaths but that's just one part of LA called Diddy's House.
*  He goes to this Diddy bit.
*  He came up with that in the green room before the show.
*  Derek was there while he was getting ready.
*  And nails it in front of everybody.
*  First time he did it.
*  Kills.
*  It's a great exercise because you know you've got the rest of your whole act.
*  So in my brain I go, let's go up and dive on the sword, see if I can, you know, mine
*  some gold and if I don't, I don't because I got 12 minutes or 30 minutes in the chamber
*  that I know works.
*  So I just, I love that opening few minutes where you just like throw it out there, man.
*  It's good.
*  It's exciting.
*  Yeah, just putting yourself in a situation.
*  Like sometimes when you're on stage and you're doing a bit, you ever go like in an other
*  direction just to see where it goes?
*  Just take a little turn?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Just see.
*  Never know.
*  And maybe that turn becomes like the best part of the bit.
*  Oh absolutely.
*  But if you don't do that, so like that's how you tell the difference between thieves and
*  comics.
*  Thieves don't, they don't do that.
*  Like all of a sudden they just have bits.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  No, switching gears in the moment is amazing.
*  And back to what you're saying about SNL, that's one of the reasons I love the purity
*  of what we do is because you can deviate.
*  You can create your own meandering pathway as opposed to structured sketches and stuff
*  like that.
*  It's really, I don't know, it just lets you soar, man.
*  Yeah, I mean you're great in sketches.
*  You're great in Dumber and Dumber.
*  That was fucking awesome.
*  Oh thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  That was hilarious.
*  It was funny seeing you in there.
*  So like you were like one of my first friends that was in a giant movie.
*  I was like, damn, look at Harlan.
*  Yeah it was right when, probably right around when I met you like it was my first movie
*  and it was like, oh no.
*  Do you want some celery?
*  Does that help?
*  I think it just makes it.
*  If you rub it.
*  Jamie, tuck me those paper towels.
*  What is that, tea?
*  No, coffee.
*  Oh god.
*  I just want to, I like this t-shirt.
*  I don't want to fuck it up.
*  Yeah, I mean we're lucky as fuck, dude.
*  We're lucky that we get to do this for a living and you and I have been doing it for so fucking
*  long.
*  Jesus, I'm sorry.
*  What are you doing to your dick?
*  No, it's just, ah.
*  What are you doing over there?
*  God.
*  Are you pulling a tapeworm out?
*  Son of a bitch.
*  Demetri.
*  God.
*  We need more preparation for this show.
*  Joe.
*  Joe.
*  Demetri.
*  You're such a sick fuck.
*  You really should go to jail.
*  You should go to jail.
*  We should deport you.
*  We should send you back to Canada.
*  What have you done to me?
*  I'm fucking out.
*  I'm fucking out.
*  I'm fucking out.
*  I'm fucking out.
*  I'm fucking out.
*  I'm fucking out.
*  I'm fucking out.
*  I'm fucking out.
*  I'm fucking out.
*  You're so fucking stupid.
*  It's warm.
*  It's been in my groin for two hours.
*  He had this in his pants the entire time.
*  You won't touch the cauliflower this summer.
*  You'll touch my groin worm.
*  I'm not into plants, but I really like snakes.
*  Harlan Williams, you're the fucking man.
*  I love you to death.
*  Thanks for being here.
*  Dude, I'm so honored.
*  Thanks for having me, buddy.
*  Let's do it again.
*  It's great.
*  I would be honored.
*  I'm going to need to recover for a few months, but then we'll get back.
*  Take Demetri with you.
*  Okay, I'll leave him on the table.
*  He'll stay here forever.
*  This is his new home.
*  He'll live amongst the trees.
*  He'll live amongst the trees.
*  He'll live amongst the trees.
*  He'll live amongst the trees.
*  He'll live amongst the trees.
