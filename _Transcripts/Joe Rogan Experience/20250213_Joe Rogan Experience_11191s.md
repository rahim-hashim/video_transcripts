# Joe Rogan Experience #2273 - Adam Curry
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28)
*  I never got it until this year, but that's what they say. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=0.0s)]
*  That's what they say. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=15.44s)]
*  You get it within a couple years, you get it, and then all of a sudden you got it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=16.64s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what the fuck they are, but it's not bad. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=21.28s)]
*  I could hear it the other day. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=23.8s)]
*  I heard it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=24.96s)]
*  Stuffiness? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=25.96s)]
*  Yeah, I heard you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=26.96s)]
*  Yeah, I had it for like four days. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=27.96s)]
*  I've had stuffiness. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=28.96s)]
*  The thing is, when I work out, I feel great. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=30.12s)]
*  The way I can really tell, the way I judge whether or not I should even work out is when [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=31.84s)]
*  I get in the sauna in the cold plunge. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=36.04s)]
*  If I feel tired and weak when I'm in there, then I know something's going on. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=37.84s)]
*  It's not as simple as allergies. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=41.44s)]
*  I thought for 10 years I had the Austin allergy. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=43.72s)]
*  For 10 years. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=47.44s)]
*  It was so bad. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=48.44s)]
*  I'd go out to dinner. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=49.44s)]
*  Even when we moved out to Fredericksburg, we'd come into Austin. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=50.44s)]
*  I thought it was Austin. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=53.84s)]
*  I'm serious. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=54.84s)]
*  I was like, Austin has given me this. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=55.84s)]
*  We go out to dinner, start eating, and then my nose, my eyes, everything just ... I have [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=57.36s)]
*  to always excuse myself. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=62.56s)]
*  Always have to have tissues in my back pocket. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=64.08s)]
*  Then I got my teeth done, which we talked about I think the last time I was here. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=67.2s)]
*  Maverick, my periodontist, he did one of these 360 MRIs. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=71.2s)]
*  He says, you know, ma'am, you've got some low-level infection here. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  That could be responsible for a whole bunch of stuff. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=80.88s)]
*  I'd had hearing aids for five years. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=82.88s)]
*  When he did the initial extraction, I think I took one or two shows off. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=85.84s)]
*  I went back in the studio, put my headphones on. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=91.32s)]
*  I'm like, whoa. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=93.84s)]
*  I thought I'd hit something, a volume knob or something. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=94.84s)]
*  Came back. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  Your hearing came back. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  Because this was infected. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  It was basically clogging up my sinuses. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  That was affecting the hearing. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=105.32s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  How can a mouth infection like that? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  That's very dangerous, isn't it? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=110.2s)]
*  People have no idea how important oral health is. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  It's really, really critical. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=115.4s)]
*  Also, I feel better because I'm not fighting infection continuously. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=117.0s)]
*  That's great. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=121.92s)]
*  How did it all start? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=122.92s)]
*  What was going on with your teeth that made all these infections? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  I had a bad start in life. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=129.6s)]
*  When I was two or three, we were living in Uganda. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=132.52s)]
*  My parents would put me to sleep with a chocolate cookie. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=135.96s)]
*  I had a bad start. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=138.68s)]
*  I had a lot of work. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=141.68s)]
*  I had tons of fillings of my baby teeth. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=142.96s)]
*  Everything was messed up. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=146.88s)]
*  Then I had the big outboard headgear, which really traumatized me for life, taking that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=147.88s)]
*  to school. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=152.8s)]
*  I was one of those guys. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=153.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=156.8s)]
*  It was bad. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=157.8s)]
*  About 10 years ago, maybe a little bit more, I went to the dentist here in Austin. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  He was like, we really got to start doing stuff. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=166.24s)]
*  We got to start looking at repairing. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=169.64000000000001s)]
*  Then this dentist started hitting on me and texting me. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=171.68s)]
*  I'm like, so ... [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=174.72s)]
*  Oh, great. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=175.72s)]
*  Guy or girl? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=176.72s)]
*  Guy. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=177.72s)]
*  Damn. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=178.72s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=179.72s)]
*  I knew that there was a Pandora's box in there. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  How wild is that? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=182.84s)]
*  What a risky move. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=183.84s)]
*  It was so dumb. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  You're a married straight guy. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  It's like, yeah, I think I can get him now. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  We can get ... He can be on our team. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=191.48000000000002s)]
*  That is such a man move. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=194.28s)]
*  That's such a thing that men would do. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=197.36s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=199.12s)]
*  I'm here with some buddies of mine, sending a picture. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=200.44s)]
*  I'm like, no, no, no, no. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=202.96s)]
*  They're all shirtless and fucking wearing cowboy hats. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=204.44s)]
*  Yeehaw. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=207.8s)]
*  I'm not going back. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=208.8s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=209.8s)]
*  Then Tina and I, we got together. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=210.8s)]
*  We moved out to Fredericksburg. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=213.44s)]
*  She's real big on preventative anything. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=215.44s)]
*  Her car has the oil, everything on time, everything's all set. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=218.44s)]
*  Her teeth, of course, are impeccable. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=222.28s)]
*  That's a good fit for you. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  Total. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=226.16s)]
*  You need an organized lady. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=227.16s)]
*  I had a credit score of 350. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=229.4s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=231.44000000000003s)]
*  I didn't have credit card. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=232.44000000000003s)]
*  I was just cash. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=233.44000000000003s)]
*  I didn't care. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=234.44000000000003s)]
*  I had cash flow. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=235.44000000000003s)]
*  Everything's good. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  She straightened me out. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  Oh, big time. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  Disorganized men very much need organized women. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  You just can't have one that turns into your mom. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=245.36s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=247.96s)]
*  That was my first wife. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=248.96s)]
*  That does happen with some of them. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=251.16000000000003s)]
*  Some of them, when you give them the reins and they start telling you what to do, all [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  of a sudden, then it becomes very non-sexy. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  I will say props to my first wife. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=259.0s)]
*  She kept me. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=261.96s)]
*  That was the height of my show business fame, MTV. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=262.96s)]
*  She kept me out of trouble. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=265.91999999999996s)]
*  I did not participate. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=267.52s)]
*  She was a good mommy. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=268.52s)]
*  She was a good mom. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=269.52s)]
*  And she's a good mom to our daughter. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=270.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=273.84s)]
*  For sure. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=274.84s)]
*  Well, you know, you change, they change. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=275.84s)]
*  You need a different kind of a mom. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=277.88s)]
*  Things change. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=279.84s)]
*  Things change. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=280.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=281.84s)]
*  So then I went through it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=282.84s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=284.96s)]
*  And that's also when I stopped smoking, you know, because Maverick called me up. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=286.44s)]
*  He said, hey, man, I'm going to be operating on you in a week. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=291.08s)]
*  You know, could you do me a favor and stop putting fire in your mouth? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=294.12s)]
*  And I've been smoking weed and tobacco since I was 15. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=296.88s)]
*  And I quit at that moment. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=300.03999999999996s)]
*  I haven't never. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=302.0s)]
*  I mean, I vape like a like a crazy horse. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=303.4s)]
*  But that's not good, is it? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=305.44s)]
*  Well, that's a question. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=306.88s)]
*  This is you and I've gone over this and we will go back to it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=308.35999999999996s)]
*  It's a nicotine delivery device. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=310.91999999999996s)]
*  Yes, that's what it is. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  We'll get to that. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=314.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=315.32s)]
*  So so just cleaning out the infections. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=315.84s)]
*  What was going on that that was fucking up your hearing? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=319.12s)]
*  It was like the whole area was inflamed. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=321.84s)]
*  Yes, right by your sinuses. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=323.84s)]
*  And so that, you know, everything's connected. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=325.52s)]
*  You know, if you hold your nose, you can hear you hear differently. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=327.64s)]
*  So right. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=330.84s)]
*  Whatever it was doing and literally just a couple of days after he extracted, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=331.71999999999997s)]
*  though he extracted more than that. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=336.56s)]
*  But after he extracted those teeth, it just came back. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=338.08s)]
*  And I didn't have horrible hearing loss, but it was enough where I was sick of [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=340.96s)]
*  saying, I'm sorry, darling, would you say I'm sorry? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=345.08s)]
*  And at the moment you get to like, I didn't hear her. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=347.24s)]
*  I'll ask her later. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=350.44s)]
*  That's when I went, no, I got to get hearing aids. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=351.56s)]
*  I don't want to. I don't. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=353.47999999999996s)]
*  And it's one of the biggest reasons men [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=354.35999999999996s)]
*  get depressed is when they can't hear and they kind of withdraw. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=358.52s)]
*  And it's it's really yeah. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=362.03999999999996s)]
*  Oh, it's a real crisis. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=363.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Anyone you need to go, if you think you just just have your ears tested anyway. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=364.91999999999996s)]
*  Why not? I mean, you get your eyes tested, get your ears tested, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=369.76s)]
*  get your teeth taken care of. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=372.47999999999996s)]
*  So they find out your ears are not good. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=373.84s)]
*  Do they ever check for infections? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=375.71999999999997s)]
*  No, because it seems like now you should get in the medical book. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=377.64s)]
*  He thank you. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=380.44s)]
*  Actually, he's been writing a paper on this for this very reason. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=382.2s)]
*  And it's only because he did the 360 MRI that he saw it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=385.32s)]
*  And he also knew what to look for. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=389.15999999999997s)]
*  It's his expertise. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=390.76s)]
*  You know, he's he's when I met this guy, I was like, he's young. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=391.71999999999997s)]
*  He's like in his 30s. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=395.96s)]
*  I'm like, so why did you choose this profession? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=396.88s)]
*  He says, I like operating. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=400.08s)]
*  I really love doing that stuff. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=401.52s)]
*  I'm like, OK, you sound cool. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=402.8s)]
*  And he turns out he's a pilot. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=404.28000000000003s)]
*  You know, so we become friends. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=405.40000000000003s)]
*  But yeah, he he says people have no idea. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=408.40000000000003s)]
*  And so he has been working on a paper to publish about this very thing. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=410.76s)]
*  It's just not known. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=414.32s)]
*  I talked about the podcast and people from all over the world like, really, man? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=415.56s)]
*  You know, I've been having hearing issues. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=419.76s)]
*  Get an MRI, get a 360 MRI of your head. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=421.28000000000003s)]

*  You know, it's an interesting subject because candy and sugar is really [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=503.40000000000003s)]
*  what caused all this horrible tooth decay in people. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=508.40000000000003s)]
*  And the goofy fucking solution that someone came up with along the way [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=511.68s)]
*  was putting fluoride in the water, which is so goddamn insane [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=516.12s)]
*  that you're taking a neurotoxin and you're putting it in the water. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=521.6s)]
*  But it and again, like I want to take even a political position on this. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=524.8s)]
*  I just want to look at it this. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=531.12s)]
*  I want to look at this from a human lens. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=532.36s)]
*  There is something that people do [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=535.84s)]
*  where even if something is obviously stupid, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=538.84s)]
*  if it's a part of a system and there's enough air quotes, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=544.4000000000001s)]
*  experts that have endorsed this, regardless of the fact [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=549.4000000000001s)]
*  we've seen time and time again throughout history that experts are compromised. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=552.0s)]
*  Experts are you could put in. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=556.44s)]
*  You could have a court case for a murder and bring in experts [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=558.24s)]
*  that will tell you he definitely did it and experts to tell you [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=562.44s)]
*  he definitely didn't do it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=565.5600000000001s)]
*  So we know this for a fact. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=566.6s)]
*  But still, people argue on the side of the experts. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=568.28s)]
*  And I've seen this about Florida. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=572.24s)]
*  And it's so mind boggling. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=573.8s)]
*  There are conclusive studies that show a direct correlation [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=576.72s)]
*  between high levels of fluoride in the local water and lower IQs. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=581.72s)]
*  And it's a neurotoxin. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=587.88s)]
*  We know it's bad for you in large doses. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=590.0s)]
*  And yet there are fucking people out there with college degrees [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=593.0s)]
*  who read the New York Times, who think they're sensible people [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=596.28s)]
*  that will get angry if you want to remove this neurotoxin from water. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=599.52s)]
*  Because look at all the strides it's done in preventing tooth decay. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=605.24s)]
*  And you just want to say, hey, man, fuck you. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=610.0799999999999s)]
*  This is stupid. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=613.16s)]
*  I went to dinner at Mitch's house. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=614.3199999999999s)]
*  I call him. I'm a little upset. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=615.92s)]
*  No, no, it's OK, because because we're sitting down as my wife, his wife. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=617.24s)]
*  You know, he has one of those houses right on the airport [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=621.1999999999999s)]
*  where this plane rolls out of the garage, you know, the hangar. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=624.24s)]
*  Is that a touch? Exactly. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=626.88s)]
*  I paid for that. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=629.72s)]
*  I like I pay for that hangar. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=631.2s)]
*  And and we're sitting down and we're having a good time. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=633.8s)]
*  You know, we're talking about stuff. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=636.52s)]
*  He says, so what do you think about Florida said should not be in the water? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=637.5600000000001s)]
*  He's like, you're wrong. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=639.96s)]
*  You know, and this is only a couple of years ago. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=641.2s)]
*  And now he's come back and he said, oh, man, this is I was this. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=643.6800000000001s)]
*  Apologize. Yeah, of course. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=647.44s)]
*  This was drilled into my head like. Yeah. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=648.76s)]
*  But what I understand is fluoride is a byproduct of aluminum production. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=651.08s)]
*  And a lot of this, you know, they had this fluoride waste product, basically. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=657.2s)]
*  They needed to get rid of it. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=661.88s)]
*  And from what I understand, it was Alcoa. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=663.08s)]
*  I could be wrong, but I think was Alcoa who made these deals. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=664.8000000000001s)]
*  And who knows how they set that up with the American Dental Association? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=668.36s)]
*  And that's how fluoride got into our water. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=671.76s)]
*  And we got this kind of Psyop of it's good for you. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=673.76s)]
*  I knew it was wrong in 2000. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=676.88s)]
*  And there was a book that came out called Legacy of Ashes [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=681.32s)]
*  was written by a guy called Tim Weiner, who used to be New York Times. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=684.28s)]
*  And it was all about the CIA. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=688.32s)]
*  And it's a great book because my uncle is in it many times. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=689.6800000000001s)]
*  Donald Greg, he's still with us. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=692.44s)]
*  He's 95 or 96. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=694.36s)]
*  And he was really high up in the CIA. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=696.2s)]
*  He was part of OSS back in the day. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=698.6800000000001s)]
*  And in it, it talks about how the how the agents would go in [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=701.5600000000001s)]
*  fluoridate the enemy's camp water so they could go in at night [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=705.24s)]
*  and they could they were docile and they could pull them out [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=709.48s)]
*  and they could kind of attack them. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=712.04s)]
*  And I said, Uncle Don, is this true? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=713.5600000000001s)]
*  He says, yeah, pretty much how I remember it. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=715.36s)]
*  I'm like, well, of course this. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=717.84s)]
*  So the neurotoxin has been used in actual warfare in the water [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=720.92s)]
*  to make people docile. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=725.08s)]
*  Yeah, docile. And then the argument is so dumb [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=726.16s)]
*  because, you know, my friend Eddie Bravo had a great point. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=729.44s)]
*  He said, when you get toothpaste, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=733.2s)]
*  do you ever see toothpaste that says fluoride free? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=736.64s)]
*  Why would they say that and advertise it? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=740.56s)]
*  Tom's if fluoride wasn't bad for you, why would they do that? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=743.88s)]
*  Like, why would that be a selling point? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=747.68s)]
*  If we've always looked for fluoride in toothpaste my whole life. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=749.96s)]
*  Crest for it. Got it. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=752.6s)]
*  You know, when you go through the CVS, you grab and throw it back. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=754.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's always fluoride. You're always looking for fluoride. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=757.16s)]
*  That's what kills the fucking germ. I don't want cavities. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=759.52s)]
*  I don't have to go to the dentist. Yeah. Give me that fluoride. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=762.12s)]
*  But they're selling toothpaste without fluoride. Why is that? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=764.72s)]
*  And the guy who was saying it to like had this look at us, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=769.2s)]
*  he was like he was trapped. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=771.2s)]
*  He was just trapped. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=773.76s)]
*  Like, so you don't think fluoride is good for you? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=774.52s)]
*  It's like one of those things. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=777.36s)]
*  That's just what he just said. No, just brush your fucking teeth. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=778.4s)]
*  It's really that simple. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=781.6s)]
*  As a kid, did you get those trays at the dentist? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=782.6800000000001s)]
*  Do you remember those? What are the trays? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=785.6s)]
*  It was it would be they say, we're going to do fluoride treatment on you. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=787.32s)]
*  Oh, yeah, they did. And it was like, it's it's it's fruity. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=790.36s)]
*  You know, and it's gunk be dripping back in your throat. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=793.84s)]
*  You're gagging with this horrible. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=796.6s)]
*  It's like that's not and you go to school and you get a D in English [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=798.28s)]
*  because you're fucking stupid. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=801.4399999999999s)]
*  Pretty much the story of my life. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=803.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's so bad. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=807.0799999999999s)]
*  It's really bad for you. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=808.96s)]
*  And it's not necessary. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=810.3199999999999s)]
*  And we're being co-opted by something and someone. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=811.52s)]
*  And I think we look this up on the podcast, Jimmy. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=814.28s)]
*  Didn't it come out of there was some town in Texas, I believe, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=816.48s)]
*  that had naturally fluoridated water, which occasionally, you know, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=821.52s)]
*  just we have it in the hill country. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=825.16s)]
*  The water is definitely naturally fluoridated. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=826.36s)]
*  It is. There's natural levels of different minerals. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=828.64s)]
*  And there's different stuff in this one area had a [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=831.56s)]
*  a fairly high natural level of fluoride. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=835.72s)]
*  And these people had like great oral hygiene. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=839.12s)]
*  Whether or not that was a convenient study that they pointed to [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=842.3199999999999s)]
*  or convenient case, they pointed to to make the argument [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=846.16s)]
*  to get rid of all that fluoride. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=848.76s)]
*  You know, this like you got to look many layers into all this kind of stuff [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=850.44s)]
*  because they've been throwing fluoride in the water for how long [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=854.72s)]
*  and how much money has been spent throwing fluoride in the water [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=858.0s)]
*  and how many people have like built mansions and have fucking, you know, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=861.6s)]
*  Mercedes Benz, they're tooling around them because they've been throwing [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=865.84s)]
*  fluoride in the water. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=868.32s)]
*  And that's that's a deep system to try to untangle after 50, 60 years. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=869.12s)]
*  It's the petrochemical industry. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=874.6400000000001s)]
*  That's where all our medicines come from. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=876.1600000000001s)]
*  I was watching the Grammys and I don't really. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=878.5600000000001s)]
*  What's wrong with you? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=881.44s)]
*  I know. Well, I usually watch for the Satan segment. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=882.12s)]
*  I was like, OK, there it is. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=884.64s)]
*  There's the Illuminati. There's this one. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=885.8s)]
*  There's the they didn't have one. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=887.92s)]
*  They had crazy, beautiful women in nice dresses. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=889.4s)]
*  Trump is president. Oh, no. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=892.28s)]
*  Presidents are important for the culture. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=894.76s)]
*  It's very important for the Satan. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=896.52s)]
*  But they're in trouble. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=897.92s)]
*  Yeah, they're in trouble. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=900.24s)]
*  Jesus is making a comeback, man. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=901.44s)]
*  They're in trouble. They hide now. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=903.44s)]
*  Go back to the basement of Comet Pizza. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=904.96s)]
*  And. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=907.24s)]
*  Places doesn't have a basement, by the way, we're reliably informed. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=909.48s)]
*  And I hadn't really watched network television a lot, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=913.6s)]
*  and there's a lot of commercial breaks, but the first 10 [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=915.92s)]
*  all had a pharmaceutical product which had never heard of a name [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=919.04s)]
*  I can't remember and side effects literally included death. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=923.08s)]
*  I'm like, what is going on with this? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=926.76s)]
*  And like, ask your doctor, I'm like, do I have this? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=929.04s)]
*  Should I have this? Do I want this? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=931.76s)]
*  I mean, is this going on with me? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=933.28s)]
*  And people are all happy in the commercials. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=934.52s)]
*  Like, look, my skin looks good and I'm happy and I have a beautiful family. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=936.5600000000001s)]
*  It's almost like we used to sell cars. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=940.12s)]
*  Now they're just selling the pharmaceuticals. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=942.04s)]
*  Well, that will be an interesting thing if R.F.K. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=944.08s)]
*  Jr. gets in place, if R.F.K. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=947.24s)]
*  Jr. gets in place and they stop this advertising. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=949.44s)]
*  On we are one of two countries on earth that allows. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=953.2s)]
*  Yeah, New Zealand and New Zealand's far more restrictive than us. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=957.04s)]
*  We should be really restrictive about this because advertising works, you know. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=959.84s)]
*  And there's advertising that doesn't bother me at all. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=964.8s)]
*  Like Chevrolet Corvette. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=967.0s)]
*  Well, I'm one of those. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=968.3199999999999s)]
*  You know, it's OK. It's fine. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=970.92s)]
*  But when it can give you bloody diarrhea and suicidal ideology and leakage. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=972.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And you're just fucked up in the head and you're depressed. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=976.04s)]
*  And like, you don't know why. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=979.0799999999999s)]
*  But now your zits are gone. Like, hey, slow down. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=979.92s)]
*  That was not in that commercial with the lady dancing in the field [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=983.76s)]
*  with her child and the people at the picnic. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=987.8s)]
*  And they're all smiling and laughing and having a good time together. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=990.16s)]
*  Yeah, that looked like fun. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=993.12s)]
*  Like, where's that part? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=994.8s)]
*  Well, of course, you know, this was they tried. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=996.68s)]
*  They've tried all kinds of things to stop this. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1000.6s)]
*  And, you know, First Amendment comes up, although we have stopped tobacco [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1002.52s)]
*  advertisements and there's all kinds of things that have been done throughout the years. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1006.0s)]
*  But what happened with television is all the money. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1010.2s)]
*  I mean, really 60, 70, maybe 80 percent of all the advertising income [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1013.36s)]
*  is from pharmaceutical companies. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1018.36s)]
*  That's why there's also no reporting. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1020.4s)]
*  Like, we're not going to bite the hand that feeds us. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1022.24s)]
*  That's the real problem. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1024.56s)]
*  That's that's the real problem. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1025.52s)]
*  The real problem is that these news organizations are not not just news, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1027.12s)]
*  not just news, right. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1031.0s)]
*  Everything. They're not independent, like even television shows. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1032.2s)]
*  Like, could you imagine if let's say a network has a prominent news organization [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1035.4s)]
*  and that news organization is very popular and it's a big part of their ratings [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1041.32s)]
*  and it's a reliable source of information for, you know, people that believe them. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1046.12s)]
*  And they're sponsored by pharmaceutical drug companies, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1051.72s)]
*  but then they also have a crime show on. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1055.3600000000001s)]
*  And this crime show wants to do a thing about an evil guy [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1058.52s)]
*  who promotes a vaccine that winds up killing a bunch of people and they hide the data [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1061.68s)]
*  and then they arrest him at the end of the end of the show like no fucking way. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1066.0800000000002s)]
*  That's not getting me no green light for you. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1069.8400000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1072.16s)]
*  You got to turn that guy into a meth dealer. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1075.64s)]
*  That's a meth dealer. Now, let's just do a couple of rewrites. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1077.5600000000002s)]
*  simple rewrite to the script. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, this is a bad guy from Guatemala. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1080.36s)]
*  It's definitely not from here. He's definitely not from Moderna. And they definitely aren't [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1088.4399999999998s)]
*  working in conjunction with the government to develop this thing and the government's [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1092.6s)]
*  profiting off of it. That's not real. Well, we've, I mean, I say that we're in the season [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1095.8s)]
*  of reveal. I've been saying this for about a year now, because it's really happening real quick with [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1100.76s)]
*  what we're uncovering and starting to understand. I haven't seen your talk with Mike Benz. Yeah, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1106.12s)]
*  Mike Benz dropped some fucking seeds yesterday. Because it's true. If we're in the season of [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1109.8s)]
*  flowers, he's blooming today. Because he was so nervous yesterday. Jamie was talking about it [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1113.56s)]
*  before. He was making all these tweets like they're going to kill him. Really? Yeah, it's [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1119.6399999999999s)]
*  probably been discussed. Well, I think it's way too far beyond. And I think, you know, I look at [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1123.56s)]
*  Leave It to Beaver, I call her, who's the new press secretary. She's 27 years old. Oh, yeah, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1130.4399999999998s)]
*  she's good, though. She's fantastic. She's younger than my daughters. A girl. I don't think you should [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1135.56s)]
*  say Leave It to Beaver. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's just that's how I remember her last name. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1140.28s)]
*  All right, Caroline, leave it. I think it's leave it. Thanks, Joe. Thanks. Thank you. So she because [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1145.3999999999999s)]
*  we're old enough to remember when Beaver was a vagina. Most kids are like, I don't even know [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1152.36s)]
*  what the fuck they're talking about. Leave it to Beaver. What are you talking about? A dumb name for a vagina, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1156.12s)]
*  a beaver. Because dudes didn't really have any derogatory names for dicks. It's just dick is the [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1160.04s)]
*  worst one. Like, oh, your dick. Put your dick away, fucking weirdo. You know what I mean? It was like, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1165.48s)]
*  but Beaver. Well, we only had Pecker. Yeah, like, but Pecker's kind of cute. Yeah, exactly. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1170.44s)]
*  Yeah, there's no like real bad names for dick other than dick. But she comes out and she does [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1177.3999999999999s)]
*  this whole list of USAID, which is very little money. And I think our president is very smart. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1183.08s)]
*  He's showing us things that enables people like Mike Benz and you and I to have these conversations [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1189.72s)]
*  about, you know, because it's not ideological that USAID, which is not USAID. This is like one of these [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1195.08s)]
*  one of these psyops right up top, like you have Federal Express is not owned by the government. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1201.96s)]
*  Federal Reserve is not owned by the government. USAID is the Agency for International Development, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1206.28s)]
*  not aid. And we see on television, there goes another palette onto the C 130 aid, USAID from [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1211.8s)]
*  the American people. We're being nice. Yeah, we're being we're being nice to people. We should be [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1218.6s)]
*  nice. We're the nice people of the world. But what these and I'm sure Mike talked about this, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1222.36s)]
*  you know, like LGBTQ, these these dance parties and things, if you look at I'm look at these [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1227.8s)]
*  countries, like these are countries where we want to keep them away from Russia overthrow the [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1232.9199999999998s)]
*  incumbent. Yes. And the way to garner support is to and I really love how they added the queue that [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1237.32s)]
*  just became so clear to me all of a sudden. If you sponsor LGBTQ, these are outcasts. These are [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1244.68s)]
*  people who feel that they've been marginalized. Then you add a queue like, wait a minute, I can [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1249.96s)]
*  be queer. I'm different. I'm odd. You bring more people in, they can bring the anarchists in, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1254.92s)]
*  you can get a they have the A's. Oh, yeah, the A's. Everything, but the A's don't even have a [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1259.64s)]
*  dog in the fight. But that's the point. You want them to come to the party, come to the party, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1265.0s)]
*  you're allowed to the party. And that's why it's so long now. And I saw this, you know, AFD in Germany, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1269.0800000000002s)]
*  this is the the extreme right party, and they wanted to slow or remove immigration. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1274.0400000000002s)]
*  And so now that there was a protest against the AFD, you know, some you're getting ready to vote [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1281.3200000000002s)]
*  now. And there's 100,000 people there. I'm like, wow, I thought I know people in Germany have [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1288.0400000000002s)]
*  friends in Germany. They really are sick and tired of this immigration stuff. So where are these [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1293.64s)]
*  people coming from? And in the news report right up front, there's a dude in a blonde wig with [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1298.2s)]
*  eyeshadow saying, we just want to get along. We just want can't we just be diverse? I'm like, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1303.56s)]
*  that's the Psyop. He's talking about himself. So he wants to feel included, which by the way, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1309.1599999999999s)]
*  in America, you can do whatever you want, call yourself whatever you want. People really don't [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1315.48s)]
*  have an issue with that. But they've just taken this and abused these people into their political [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1319.48s)]
*  agendas all over the world. And of course, it sparked something here in the States. If you look, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1326.9199999999998s)]
*  the Democrat Party, there's they're gonna die on this hill. They're still like, oh, no, LGBTQ. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1332.52s)]
*  They're taking away our rights, because they know they can mobilize people to do that. And then you [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1337.56s)]
*  can throw in Palestine, all kinds of people join the city council thing and Worcester, Massachusetts [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1343.16s)]
*  yesterday. That's gone viral today. Which one is did you see it? Oh, yeah, pull this bitch up. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1348.6s)]
*  I haven't seen this. There's a compilation of these people, like absolutely freaking out. The [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1356.04s)]
*  best one's the compilation, if you can find the compilation. But it's all these LBGT people show [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1361.88s)]
*  up at this city council meeting to say there's like a trans genocide. It's one of those did we're [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1367.56s)]
*  going to round up in concentration camps. Yeah, five minutes long. Yeah, just give me start from [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1372.44s)]
*  the beginning. Can you wrap up, please? Yes, I can. If you say that you're afraid of Trump, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1376.1200000000001s)]
*  and that's why you don't want the city to be a space safe space for trans people, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1383.72s)]
*  you better prepare for trans people to make this a very unsafe space. Oh, brother, I'm shaking [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1388.76s)]
*  right now. I don't want to be here. I'm sorry. Am I taking too long pleading for my life? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1395.08s)]
*  You remembered how many children I have and how many and that two of them are trans. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1403.16s)]
*  There it is. Yeah, I speak as both the B and the T in the LGBT. He's both. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1407.3999999999999s)]

*  people need hugs. They need love. I pray for them. The biggest way to psychologically manipulate [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1468.52s)]
*  people is or there's three ways old people, puppies and children. And the whole and I followed this. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1475.8799999999999s)]
*  It started around 2012. Not coincidental when you know what Smith month the Smith month act. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1481.72s)]
*  So that's you know, there was a law that was put in since the church commission. You can't [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1487.56s)]
*  propagandize the American people. Defense Department and others went to the government said, well, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1491.1599999999999s)]
*  like we're on the internet now, we might accidentally push some propaganda on people. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1496.84s)]
*  It started with bullying in schools. I know because John Dworak and I, we followed it on [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1502.68s)]
*  no agenda. Started with bullying, then it was we needed anti bullying laws. And we're literally [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1506.68s)]
*  going like, what happened to sticks and stones will break my bones or punch the bully in his [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1511.96s)]
*  nose? No, no, no. Then the teachers and then we got hate speech laws, not actually laws, but hate [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1516.12s)]
*  speech punishments. And this kept building up until you guaranteed parents through the American [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1521.96s)]
*  Medical Association, the Pediatric Society, all of these different trade groups, that if you don't [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1529.72s)]

*  thing that they've done. Think about these parents who may or may not one day wake up and go, what [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1543.08s)]
*  have I done? What have I done? Well, there was someone was talking about this the other day, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1548.52s)]
*  this is the real problem is that so many parents have committed to doing this to their children [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1553.8799999999999s)]
*  and they cannot face the reality of what they've done. And so they're going to dig their heels in [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1558.2s)]
*  forever. And they're going to talk about gender affirming care. But the thing is, that's a small [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1564.04s)]
*  percentage of people in the general population. Thank God. Thank God. But they're over represented [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1569.8799999999999s)]
*  in the fact that they make it their whole life. And so they're very loud and very vocal. And then [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1576.6s)]
*  they become a political beach ball. I heard you talk about that with Bridget. That's what it is. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1581.0s)]
*  The political beach balls at a concert, they chalk them up in the air. So we always have something [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1586.6799999999998s)]
*  to fight about. So we're not paying attention to like the USAID stuff or a lot of the stuff that's [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1590.04s)]
*  really important. And this is just a part of this inter tangled web of psyops that's been running [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1594.76s)]
*  our culture. I mean, I would say our government but it's everything. Culture. So it's the [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1606.44s)]
*  government has established its hooks in us and put fear and law and rules. And the more law and the [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1611.1599999999999s)]
*  more rules, the better because the more likely you're going to break a few of them and then [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1619.08s)]
*  you're going to shut the fuck up. And they've got these fucking things everywhere. And it's just [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1621.48s)]
*  allowing them to run this mafia business. And there's a bunch of people that are reasonable, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1627.48s)]
*  educated people that have Stockholm syndrome. Like they don't want to admit that even their [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1633.32s)]
*  people, their cherished heroes like Obama was a part of this. And that these all these people [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1640.36s)]
*  that you think of as progressive Democrats, they were all a part of it. And fortunately today, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1646.84s)]
*  we have the convenient access to YouTube instantaneously where you can watch Obama [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1653.0s)]
*  in 2003 say some very MAGA things. Or you could watch Hillary Clinton go more MAGA than MAGA. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1660.04s)]
*  About deportation. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1667.8s)]
*  Yes. Yes. And that if you stay, you have to pay a stiff fine. I mean, the whole thing is [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1669.0s)]
*  it's cyclical, right? Like this is why the left is now supporting war and censorship. It's not real. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1677.0s)]
*  It's not that there's a good group of kind, compassionate, educated people and a bunch [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1683.96s)]
*  of fucking buffoons who are racist who want to bring that back to Confederate flag. That's not [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1688.92s)]
*  what's going on. There's people that are nice, kind people that also understand the value of [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1693.48s)]
*  hard work and reality and kindness and also sternness and rule of law. And you can't just [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1699.96s)]
*  let violent criminals out in the street and hey, maybe you should do some actual rehabilitation [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1707.4s)]
*  with the fucking billions of dollars you make in the prison industrial complex when there's [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1712.04s)]
*  no rehabilitation, like no real concerted efforts to completely change these people and studies. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1716.76s)]
*  It's a mess. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1723.08s)]
*  It can be done. It could be done and it probably could be done with psychedelic drugs. They [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1724.44s)]
*  probably can do some things with people, especially nonviolent criminals that are trying to figure out [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1730.84s)]
*  why have I been stealing from people my whole life? What the fuck is wrong with me? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1736.52s)]
*  Unless they're a legitimate psychopath, they have no empathy. There's people that can be [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1741.8799999999999s)]
*  woken up to why they're in this horrific pattern of continual abuse in their life. There's ways [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1747.0s)]
*  to do it. Rick Perry has been really brave in this case because he's a former Republican [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1753.56s)]
*  governor of Texas and now he's advocating for Ibogaine therapy, particularly for veterans. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1761.48s)]
*  For guys who come over, they've seen the most horrific shit. Their brain is in a shambles and [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1766.8400000000001s)]
*  they want to do something and they have no help in these pills that just dull their mind and [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1772.36s)]
*  make them feel detached from reality and all these fucking antidepressants and things they give them [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1779.7199999999998s)]
*  and they want to fucking end their life and they can go and get therapy that cures 80% of them with [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1785.08s)]
*  one dose and it's like 95% with two doses. It's fucking nuts, man. We've been hiding this because [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1793.56s)]
*  of the sweeping Schedule 1 drug act of 1970 that was put in place directly by Nixon to go after his [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1803.24s)]
*  political opponents. It was directly put in place to demonize the anti-war movement and demonize the [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1811.08s)]
*  Civil Rights Party and the Black Panthers and anybody who was a problem with the government. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1818.28s)]
*  So they just said, let's just make all these things these people are taking on a regular basis [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1823.56s)]
*  completely illegal. Not only just Schedule 1, with no medical use whatsoever, things that people have [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1828.52s)]
*  been using for thousands and thousands of years and it's all the same shit. It's all psyops. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1834.76s)]
*  Have you ever heard of the audience effect? It is a psychological theory that our behavior changes [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1841.88s)]
*  when we know we're being watched and here's the thing, we are being watched when you use the [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1847.0s)]
*  internet. Data brokers watch and record everything you do online even if you're using a private [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1852.92s)]
*  browser. But you don't have to become a slave to the digital surveillance state. You can free [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1859.0s)]

*  thing that happened around that time, of course, during Kennedy is we realized that television was [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1928.68s)]
*  a big force. Television and radio. Oh yeah, they got that handsome guy. And if you listen to some [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1934.68s)]
*  of the debates, it would sound on the radio like Nixon did better. I mean, it's amazing how this [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1941.0s)]
*  worked between radio and television, but then newspapers, we know the intelligence agencies [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1949.8s)]
*  were all writing stories. I mean, you look at CNN, you still see ex-CIA guy shows up. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1955.24s)]
*  A little story, when I saw you sitting at the inauguration and I think I texted you, I'm like, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1961.96s)]
*  dude, I can't believe it. I see you sitting there. You're texting me American flag emojis and stuff [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1966.76s)]
*  like, and you and Trump, I'm like, oh, look at him, he's in a tuxedo. And I thought, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1971.32s)]
*  so in 1983, I was still a teenager and I grew up in Amsterdam, socialist country. The airwaves [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1977.56s)]
*  were controlled by the government. It was horrible. It was almost like Russia. Your phone was a gray [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1989.8799999999999s)]
*  phone and that was your phone. You couldn't get a different phone. It was illegal to unplug it [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1994.4399999999998s)]
*  from the wall. And I was doing pirate radio at a place called Radio Decibel in Amsterdam. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=1998.6s)]
*  And we were playing Christian Slater in a way. Oh yeah. Yeah. What was that? What was that movie [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2004.12s)]
*  called? Maybe it was called pirate radio. It was crazy. They were trying to arrest him. Remember? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2011.32s)]
*  Well, so we all got arrested several times and we were playing 12 inch imports from your Chicago [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2017.1599999999999s)]
*  warehouse. It's several times. Oh yeah. Oh, they would always get, they'd always come in and arrest [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2022.76s)]
*  us. We literally had the station name on the door. People would come around, we'd be smoking weed, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2026.9199999999998s)]
*  we were hanging out. We weren't making any money. We were basically paying to do it. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2034.04s)]
*  We had this huge antenna on the roof. Did this ever come up when you got hired by MTV? Did they [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2038.44s)]
*  get nervous about that? Did they have to do a background check? This guy's got a record. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2042.52s)]
*  No. Remind me to tell you my USAID story in a minute. So no, but this is 1983 and I felt it was [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2046.6s)]
*  so, of course I was a gawky, awkward kid. I got tics, I got the wrong hair, I got the wrong moped, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2054.6s)]
*  everything's wrong. But on the radio, people are like, wow, and I was doing it in English, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2059.72s)]
*  you can do that in Amsterdam. If you're like, wow, it's so cool, you got that black guy on your [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2064.3599999999997s)]
*  station. I'm like, I'm black? Oh cool. So I was John Holden, the 23 year old black guy who drives [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2068.68s)]
*  a Harley. But the point was it was liberating. I could speak my mind and everything felt so [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2074.12s)]
*  stifling. Now we go forward, 1993. And I'm on MTV. I'm the hair of Generation X. I'm on Z100 in New [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2079.16s)]
*  York, number one station. And I'm also on the internet. I'd set up MTV.com. It was very, very [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2087.72s)]
*  slimy. We had dial-up modems at the time. And it was so restrictive. They let me do my own material, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2093.8799999999997s)]
*  but they had censorship called a line producer. Like, now we got to burn that segment. You said [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2100.8399999999997s)]
*  something bad about Richard Marx. Oh, you said something that was off color about Madonna. Oh, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2106.2799999999997s)]
*  we can't do that. The radio was the same. It was like, read the liner card. And then always end [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2110.52s)]
*  with Z100. And there was a guy at Sun Microsystems in San Francisco. And he said, Adam, I see what [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2116.44s)]
*  you're doing with MTV.com on the web. That's going to send you a computer. So he sends me this big [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2123.32s)]
*  Sun Spark workstation. He said, what year? 93. So this is pre-Windows 95. So this is, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2128.12s)]
*  yeah, it's pretty, yeah, that's right. Windows. What is it? 3.8 or something like that. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2134.36s)]
*  Solaris OS. It's Unix basically. So it wasn't Windows back then, right? Like what came before [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2138.12s)]
*  Windows? No, I had a Mac. No, I had an early Apple 2. 3.1. That's what it was. Yeah, 3.1 and an Apple 2. I was [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2143.64s)]
*  more Apple guy at the time. And so I hooked it up to my 56K mode. Dial in. He says, watch this. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2150.92s)]
*  And he says, and I'm on the phone with him. He says, watch this. And up on my screen [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2158.8399999999997s)]
*  pops a little player and he's streaming in PC. We didn't have MP3s back then. PCM, pulse code [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2163.0s)]
*  modulation, nine inch nails. I'm like, this is broadcasting. I'm going to figure out how we use [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2169.08s)]
*  this thing for broadcasting because think about how we can use this outside of all the systems. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2175.56s)]
*  And so 2003, now we're 10 years later, I've been very involved with RSS feeds and blogs. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2181.64s)]
*  And I see my first iPod and it's like, snap, crackle, pop. Hold on a second. This is amazing. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2189.24s)]
*  This is a radio. This is not a music device. It's radio. So I cobbled together this program that [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2195.72s)]
*  basically takes this RSS feed and then puts a program on. So the show was an album and then [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2203.48s)]
*  each track was an episode number. And then I immediately started doing a show. What I do is [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2210.04s)]
*  just try to get people involved. That's how Daily Source Code started because I was trying to get [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2215.16s)]
*  software developers in. And then two years later, three years later, Steve Jobs is having a private [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2219.08s)]
*  conversation with me about putting this into the iPod and making it official, making a podcasting [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2224.92s)]
*  thing in iTunes. And I'm like, this is so perfect because now you have this RSS feed, which you [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2231.7200000000003s)]
*  control. No one else can control what you do with your RSS feed. And anybody can slurp that up and [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2237.4s)]
*  subscribe to your radio show. And then 20 years later, I see the president of the United States [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2243.2400000000002s)]
*  wrapping up his campaign with Joe Rogan on a podcast, completely being himself, being a dude [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2251.56s)]
*  for three, by the way, props for you sticking to your guns. I love that you did that. Now it's gotta [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2258.7599999999998s)]
*  be here. No restrictions on time. Well, he didn't impose any, but he was more than willing to do it [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2262.84s)]
*  exactly how I do it. He understands it. But at that moment, then I see you sitting there. I'm like, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2269.48s)]
*  we just broke the elite messaging machine. Phase one complete. Oh, because you dog. No, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2275.16s)]
*  you dog. You dog, man. I always give you your props. I think you were the first. I was just a [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2281.0800000000004s)]
*  vessel. It makes sense to me. Well, I'm just a vessel too. I think that's the case with all of it. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2289.1600000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. I say that to the guys at my comedy club. They're always so thankful that I built [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2294.28s)]
*  this comedy club. I'm like, I think this thing built itself. I think it was just, I was a thing [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2299.48s)]
*  that it did through me. It caught me because it knew that I was capable of doing it and impulsive [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2305.32s)]
*  enough and brash enough to say, fuck it, let's just dump a bunch of money in this spot and see [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2312.52s)]
*  what happens. You were given gifts. I was given gifts. And you stuck with your gifts. And I know [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2317.7200000000003s)]
*  you're a very generous guy. I know you help a lot of people with all, not monetary necessarily, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2322.44s)]
*  but just helping them, getting them on their feet. Even Parker, I'm like, can I bring this kid? He's [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2327.32s)]
*  a big fan. You're like, absolutely bring him in. You're a gracious guy. And so when you get whatever [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2332.6s)]
*  word it is to build a comedy club, you did. I think you have to do that. I think that's the [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2338.36s)]
*  universe is testing you. And if you pay attention to yourself, you'll feel like what's the right [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2343.88s)]
*  thing to do. What is the greedy impulsive thing to do? What is the miserly thing to do? Save it all. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2348.7599999999998s)]
*  It's my money. Save it all. That usually doesn't end well for those people. No, it's just, it's [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2355.4s)]
*  bad for you too, because it's, I always talk about this in terms of careers, like, and I really try [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2362.36s)]
*  to put this in young comics minds. There's an impulse that you will have when someone's doing [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2368.28s)]
*  better than you and you'll, you'll be angry at them. It is a bitter, pathetic, jealous, normal [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2373.08s)]
*  instinct that people have. The enemy, the enemy talking to you. It's just, you have to recognize [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2380.44s)]
*  what that is. What that is, is you have a desire to be doing the same thing. This person is doing [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2384.84s)]
*  this thing. They are in the movie. They are on the TV show. They are headlining at the club and [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2390.92s)]
*  you feel bad because it's not you. So you decide that they are bad. And so you start looking at [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2396.2000000000003s)]
*  them as a source of negativity towards you and you don't do all the logical objective reasoning [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2402.28s)]
*  that allows you to go, Oh no, no, no, no, no, they didn't do anything wrong. It's just me. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2408.04s)]
*  And then those people who get really super big and famous oftentimes get very defensive [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2411.96s)]
*  and very elitist because they do understand that people are mad at them now. So then they're like, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2416.76s)]
*  fuck those people. Those people are fucking losers. And it's bad for everybody. It's bad [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2421.32s)]
*  for everybody. The correct way to do it is to go, wow, look at what this person has accomplished. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2426.5200000000004s)]
*  That's fucking amazing. That's inspiring. I want to do something like that with my life. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2432.28s)]
*  Which is what America used to be. People would come to him. Yeah, I think it is. I think it is. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2437.96s)]
*  It's been covered up. It's been papered over by media, basically. That's why I'm so happy that [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2443.0s)]
*  we've broken through that elite messaging system. The way I was raised is in America, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2448.2s)]
*  you can look at the guy with the Rolls Royce or the Cadillac or whatever and go, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2454.76s)]
*  I want that and you can be that. And we've kind of devolved into a, you know, it's international [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2458.76s)]
*  now into a victim mentality. There's good and evil. It's just a ploy. It's again, the same thing as [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2465.24s)]
*  Florida in the water. It's a fucking Psy-Op. It's a ploy. And it's a way to keep us, instead of [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2472.36s)]
*  empowering people to recognize that all these people that are successful are inspiration. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2478.92s)]
*  That's what they are. They're fuel for you. You can use them. Whatever that person is singing at [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2485.6400000000003s)]
*  the Grammys, when Kendrick Lamar is doing the halftime show, when someone wins a fight, that's [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2490.04s)]
*  supposed to be inspiration. That's a fuel. And you can use it correctly. Or you can fuck your [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2495.08s)]
*  whole life up by paying attention to other people and comparing yourself in a negative way. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2502.12s)]
*  This is part of the problem with kids and social media. Because kids are supposed to see like, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2507.3199999999997s)]
*  oh, look at Bobby. He's nice to everybody and everybody likes Bobby. Be like Bobby. Like look [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2514.04s)]
*  at Mark. He's fucking awesome at the guitar and everybody wants to go see him play. I want someone [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2519.7999999999997s)]
*  to come see me do something. I wish I was as good at something as Mark is at guitar. And that's what's [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2525.16s)]
*  supposed to raise us all up. But instead we see a thousand followers and likes on someone blasting [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2531.0s)]
*  somebody in a funny way in a video. This is a big part of the problem. But sometimes funny way [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2538.12s)]
*  blasting is important too. Because that's my line of work. You've got to talk shit. You are a [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2544.04s)]
*  professional, Joe. You're a professional. How do you become a professional? You start off as an [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2549.64s)]
*  amateur. You start off talking shit. We can't all be a comedian or a comic. We just can't. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2553.64s)]
*  I think a lot more can than you think. There's a lot of people out there that have the inclination [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2558.2s)]
*  that just don't get that spark. Which is also one of the things we're trying to do at the club. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2563.16s)]
*  Which is also why we have two nights of open mic nights. Oh, that's cool. Yeah. We want to make it [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2567.3199999999997s)]
*  accessible. We want to make this is like a place where there's a real path you can work on your act. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2571.7999999999997s)]
*  And you're going to see guys like on a daily basis, guys like Ron White and Shane Gillis. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2577.7999999999997s)]
*  People coming in and out of town, they're doing my podcast. They're like the best of the best in the [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2583.64s)]
*  world. They're coming to the club. Oh, this is the center of the universe now for comedy. It is. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2587.4s)]
*  It's amazing what's taking place. It's amazing. And again, I think this place, I think it built [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2591.56s)]
*  itself. I think I just had to do it. I was like- I just got to tell you, no, no, no. God loves you, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2596.2000000000003s)]
*  Joe. He is at work in you. He's all over you and has been that way for a long, long time. There's [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2602.36s)]
*  no doubt in my mind. Well, whatever it is, I'm listening. You'll accept it. Yeah, that's it. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2607.96s)]
*  I accept it and I listen and I go with it. Yeah. But I think it all, like too many things had to [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2611.96s)]
*  happen. Like if you want to believe in fate, if you really want to believe in fate, I should believe [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2616.84s)]
*  in fate. Because especially with like this move here, too many things had to happen in line. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2621.1600000000003s)]
*  It had to be the pandemic and it had to be me with young kids who just was very uncomfortable with [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2626.92s)]
*  the direction that LA was going. And then it had to be the George Floyd riots and the lockdowns. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2633.2400000000002s)]
*  And then I had to come to Texas and go, oh, oh, there's other ways that people live. And I'd known [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2638.04s)]
*  you for a long time and you lived here and you spoke very highly. And then my good friend, Gary, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2643.4s)]
*  Gary Clark Jr., he came here like before the pandemic. And I remember talking to him on the [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2649.2400000000002s)]
*  phone. I'm like, why did you move back to Texas? He's like, man, I just cannot fuck with those [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2655.2400000000002s)]
*  people in LA. And Gary's like the realest dude I know. It's like one of the realest. Like he doesn't [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2659.4s)]
*  give a fuck about fame, about that guy cares about playing that fucking guitar and playing songs as [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2664.36s)]
*  good as he can. And that guy just locks himself up in a studio. He's got a studio on his house. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2670.92s)]
*  At his house. That's what you want. Locks himself up in there for 12 hours a day. And it's just [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2675.4s)]
*  that guy only gives a fuck about the art. Like he's about the craft and like all the bullshit [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2680.12s)]
*  that came along with living in Hollywood. He would just come hang out at the Comedy Store all the [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2685.2400000000002s)]
*  time. That was because it was like, oh, you guys are real. I can hang with you. We just be cracking [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2689.0s)]
*  up and hanging. So when he came out here, it's like, fuck. And then Ron White came out here. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2694.04s)]
*  I'm like, God damn it. And then it was all fucking love it. It's fucking airports, a breeze, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2697.56s)]
*  no traffic. Everyone's nice. It's the middle of the country. Oh, fuck. And then the pandemic [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2704.04s)]
*  happened. And it just, it was like, it all pulled me to the spot. And then it had to be the Spotify [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2709.08s)]
*  thing. And then it had to be the Comedy Store shutting down for a year. And then it had to be [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2714.84s)]
*  all the Comedy Store employees that I loved were all unemployed. And so then it was like, okay, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2718.68s)]
*  let's fucking do this. Exactly what I'm seeing. I'm seeing that with every, that's why it started [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2723.64s)]
*  in 1983. I'm like, I see where the path was. I've always been doing this stuff. And that's the thing [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2728.04s)]
*  about podcasting to me too. It was oddly compelling. Like it didn't make any sense. I was making no [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2733.7999999999997s)]
*  money and I was busy. It was costing you money probably on bandwidth and stuff. It was definitely [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2740.8399999999997s)]
*  costing some money. And I had young kids and it was just like, why am I spending my time doing [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2745.16s)]
*  this when I should be spending my time maybe doing something to make more money? Because [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2750.84s)]
*  especially back then, it was like I wasn't doing Fear Factor anymore. So I wasn't really making [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2754.52s)]
*  the kind of money that I was making when I was on television. So I had a tour a lot. So I was doing [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2760.04s)]
*  standup and I was doing like way too many dates with the UFC. The UFC, although I love it to death, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2763.88s)]
*  I mean, that's the only job job I still have. I still work for somebody. But it's because I've [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2769.4s)]
*  been there for so long, but it was like 22 dates a year. Do they send you a W9? I think I'm an [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2774.36s)]
*  independent contractor. What's a W9? How does that work? I have accountants. I was just messing [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2780.28s)]
*  with you. I'm like Joe Walsh. I have accountants paid for it all. Yes, right. I got a Maserati [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2785.7200000000003s)]

*  That's right. It's a great song. I use that song all the time. Everybody's so different. I haven't [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2801.0800000000004s)]
*  changed. You know, he's a ham radio guy, Joe Walsh. Is he really? He takes his rig out on the, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2804.36s)]
*  he doesn't go on the road that much anymore. When he's on the road, he has this huge ham radio rig. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2808.6s)]
*  And that's like, I've been a ham for a long time. And that's like the, if you have a, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2813.3199999999997s)]
*  we call it a QSL, QSO, that's a, that's ham code for a conversation. Oh, okay. With Joe Walsh. Oh, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2818.2799999999997s)]
*  man. There he is. Look at that. Joe Walsh is the fucking man, dude. He's awesome. Life in the fast [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2825.16s)]
*  lane. That's right. That dude changed the Eagles. The Eagles are the way to killing your testosterone [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2830.12s)]
*  and making women cry all day. And then all of a sudden Joe Walsh comes along and now you've got [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2834.44s)]
*  life in the fast lane. Give me, give me that riff. Give me the beginning of life in the fast lane. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2838.84s)]
*  It was wild rock and roll guitar attached to this beautiful voice and lyrics and songs and songwriting. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2846.84s)]
*  Give me, give me this, Jamie. Give it to me. See how accurate it was. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2856.52s)]
*  Did a little, but it was, there was a, there's a, you know, guitar, like I was talking about Gary, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2859.72s)]
*  like here, oh, that's all we can do. We have trouble getting trouble. Get in trouble. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2866.7599999999998s)]
*  Is that already going to get us in trouble? Probably. Probably. You're screwed. Because [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2875.96s)]
*  here we have all these podcasts. There's four and a half million podcasts, really only 400,000 update [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2880.52s)]
*  regularly. So it's not even that much. That's global. They've, we, we, we, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2885.48s)]
*  you're teasing me. We can't play music in podcasts because of all these different [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2894.2s)]
*  entities that own it. And so, you know, you, if you, if you perform something on the radio [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2901.08s)]
*  or in a live stream, that's a performance, right? Which you know, the club plays for that too, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2906.68s)]
*  if you're playing any music, that's ASCAP BMI. Then you have the, the publishing right now, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2910.92s)]
*  because you download a podcast. Well, all of a sudden now you've made a copy of it. So that's [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2917.2400000000002s)]
*  another group over here. So you have the publishers, then the record companies, you have all the, and [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2921.64s)]
*  they just could never agree. And they've locked themselves in so tight that the biggest opportunity [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2925.96s)]
*  for music would be to play it on podcasts. They've just, they've, they've painted themselves into a [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2931.96s)]
*  corner. And it's so, and we all know now that most artists, you know, you get 10,000 streams on [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2937.8s)]
*  Spotify and you get a, you know, a penny after, after a couple of years. You see what Snoop Dogg, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2943.5600000000004s)]
*  when he was going over this? Oh, it's, it's, it's horrendous. He got a thousand bucks, billions [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2949.0800000000004s)]
*  of streams and you got to check for 45 grand and Taylor Swift gets all the rest of the money. I [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2956.2000000000003s)]
*  mean, it's, it's very odd because Taylor Swift owns her music. Isn't that the whole deal? Like [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2960.36s)]
*  if you own your music, if you're the publisher and any of, you know, this, I don't want to get [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2965.0s)]
*  too deep into Spotify and all that, but people are starting to move away from that. And what I call [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2969.08s)]
*  the value for value model where we actually built this with podcasting 2.0, where you can say, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2974.76s)]
*  you can send a boost, like I want to send some money to this person straight from the app. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2981.32s)]
*  So you can play it, you can play a song in the podcast as long as they've agreed to the, to the [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2985.2400000000002s)]
*  license. They own all their stuff. You can send the money. We just did Suzanne Santa. We had a, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2990.12s)]
*  I invited you to that. Yeah, I couldn't make it. All I had to say is I invited Joe. That was all [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=2995.4s)]
*  I needed to say. And, you know, we had six people on stage, six different bands, and they all made [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3001.72s)]
*  between six and $800 coming just from, from out there. There was not, there was maybe 50, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3008.12s)]
*  at the end of the night, maybe 50 people left. It's a Monday night, but they were all making [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3014.8399999999997s)]
*  more money than they had ever made on any other platform in their life. Just because people can [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3019.08s)]
*  send it through the internet through, we actually use. Isn't that crazy that $600 for a performance [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3024.68s)]
*  that goes on the internet is the most they've ever made from the internet. Absolutely. Isn't [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3030.04s)]
*  that crazy? Like you think about how many times they streamed, like I found out about Suzanne from [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3034.68s)]
*  online, some dude named balls of steel sent me a message and he said, this is your new favorite [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3040.92s)]
*  song. And I was like, what? And it was honey, honey, angel of death. They did an acoustic [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3045.8s)]
*  version on the top of a roof in downtown LA and it was incredible. And I was like, oh my God. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3050.52s)]
*  And then I became friends with them and she didn't make her great. And their baby is super cute. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3055.32s)]
*  Have you seen that? Yeah, it's adorable. It's very cute. Her mom, I love it. But it's all, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3059.96s)]
*  it's like that there's been so many streams on the radio and the fact that you never made more than [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3065.0s)]
*  $600 is crazy. Like something's broken. Well, that's because the publishers are getting all [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3070.36s)]
*  of that. Right. And exactly. Because you know, it's and then, but then on the other hand, you get, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3076.92s)]
*  you know, you can get really famous, like people like tile, the creator and all these different [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3082.92s)]
*  people that have blown up just from being on the internet. And then they do live performances. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3087.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. But I still feel that someone's making money. Well, we know the publishers are making [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3091.8s)]
*  money. People say the record companies, but it's the publishers. Yeah. They can't call [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3098.44s)]
*  record companies anymore if they don't make records. Thank you. I was in my garage the other day and I [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3101.96s)]
*  put my wall of fame in the garage and like time to move this out of the house. Like I'm old enough [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3107.64s)]
*  now. And I'm looking at like, there's a, a platinum record with a cassette with a platinum cassette. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3111.56s)]
*  Do people even remember these days when you got a platinum record with a cassette on it for a [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3120.52s)]
*  five million copies sold of a cassette tape? Jelly Roll gave us one of his platinum records. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3125.48s)]
*  We got it out there in the hall. That guy, that guy is awesome. He's the jelly roll is what a story. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3129.64s)]
*  He's such a sweetheart. He's such a nice guy. He's a big crossover artist. You know, the Christians [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3134.7599999999998s)]
*  love him. The country guys love him. The rock and rollers love him. It's like, he's the perfect, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3139.64s)]
*  perfect crossover artist. If I were an evil record executive, he's the perfect, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3143.96s)]
*  he's a perfect crossover artist. Joe, we need to sign him. That's what I'd be doing. Also like most [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3149.88s)]
*  unlikely looking to be the sweetest guy ever for the fucking, all the face tattoos and everything. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3154.84s)]
*  Just goes to show. Yeah. Can't tell a book by its cover. No, you cannot. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3159.7200000000003s)]
*  Ever, ever, ever, ever. So anyway, back to that. It's just, it's a shame that we've, you know, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3163.7200000000003s)]
*  the right, the music industry has moved it into this protectionist place. And it's, I mean, even [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3171.88s)]
*  if you have a spin studio, you know, the Gestapo comes around like, you know, you've got more than [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3179.8s)]
*  75 people a day here. You need to pay us more. And it's, you know, they're very litigious. The [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3186.44s)]
*  whole thing is just a mess. Yeah. It's a mess. Yeah. I mean, law is great because it protects you from [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3191.32s)]
*  scumbags, but law is not so great. Yeah, but who's it protecting now? Because the artists are making [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3197.96s)]
*  no money. Exactly. Although it's become easier to, you know, to do your music at home. That's, I mean, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3202.04s)]
*  I remember going to the hit factory in New York and hanging out, you know, watching people record [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3208.6s)]
*  records. That was amazing with, you know, the big machines and lots of people running around. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3214.36s)]
*  Well, it was cool. I think YouTube and social media presents very unique opportunities where a guy [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3218.92s)]
*  like Oliver Anthony can all of a sudden explode out of nowhere with one song. He's another sweetheart. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3225.32s)]
*  Yeah. You had him on. Yeah. He was at the club the other day too. We were all hanging out. Where does [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3231.0s)]
*  he live? I think he's still... Is he down south? Maybe he doesn't want people knowing. Okay. Well, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3234.76s)]
*  he lives... I don't want to say around, but he was, I mean, back... Was he... He was in Virginia? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3239.96s)]
*  West Virginia. Okay. Yeah. West Virginia. That makes sense. Richmond, because Richmond, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3249.1600000000003s)]
*  north of Richmond was the song. Right, right, right, right. Yeah. That's where he was. I don't [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3252.44s)]
*  know if he's there anymore. And God bless him because he stayed away from the system. Yeah, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3257.0800000000004s)]
*  we had a phone call. Yeah. I called him up when it would all started popping off for him. He said, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3262.44s)]
*  I'm going to sign you, boy. I'm going to sign you to my Rogan Records. You're going to make millions. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3267.64s)]
*  Here, take this Cadillac. It'll be great. Yeah. I sent the Cadillac right to his house. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3272.04s)]
*  That's the last thing you want to give that guy. You want to give him like a 1983 [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3277.32s)]
*  like Chevy that's redone, you know, a pickup truck, like an F-150 from the 80s. That's like redone. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3280.44s)]
*  The boxy ones. Yeah. A track in the dash. Good to go. Yeah. No, he's a genuine guy. He's a really [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3287.72s)]
*  nice guy. And we had this conversation over the phone. He said, people are offering me millions [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3294.12s)]
*  of dollars to do this and that. And I go, stay independent. And he goes, they keep saying, [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3298.52s)]
*  I got to strike while the iron's hot. I go, no, no, no, no, no. Listen to me. You've already made it. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3302.8399999999997s)]
*  All you have to do now is just keep doing what you just did and you can do that, right? I'm sure you [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3308.12s)]
*  have other songs. He goes, oh, I got a bunch of other songs. Then he sent me some of his other [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3312.7599999999998s)]
*  songs, which are just as good, if not better. And I was like, dude, you have talent. Talent is what [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3315.64s)]
*  you, that's what everybody needs. All this other stuff is people just trying to take advantage of [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3320.2799999999997s)]
*  your talent. Stay independent. That's what I mean about you, Joe. You are, you're a good guy. But I [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3324.3599999999997s)]
*  was already, I was already past that spot where he's at. Like I'd been in that spot before where [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3329.16s)]
*  people were offering you deals and stuff like that. I know what the trappings of that is. You're broke [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3336.04s)]
*  and then all of a sudden you have money. And like for me, it worked out great. That happened to me [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3341.0s)]
*  in 1993. I got this big development deal with Disney and I moved out to California to do a [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3345.64s)]
*  sitcom. But it was like, but it was, I wanted to be a comic. And then all of a sudden I've got all [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3351.4s)]
*  this money that's coming from TV. I'm like, this is so weird. Was that news radio? No, that was hardball. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3355.64s)]
*  It was a baseball show that was on Fox that never made it. I was an MTV man. I wasn't paying [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3360.6s)]
*  attention to any of that stuff. Oh, it didn't make it. It actually started at MTV because I got a [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3365.16s)]
*  development deal with MTV first. Really? Yeah. But the development deal at MTV was like 500 bucks [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3369.88s)]
*  to do a pilot. I'm not kidding. And then it sounds like MTV. I'm not kidding. It was like 500 bucks. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3375.2400000000002s)]
*  Something, maybe 5,000. I don't think it was though. I think it was $500. And if I did the pilot and the [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3380.12s)]
*  pilot was successful, they would have me locked in for some exorbitant amount of time. I think it was [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3386.04s)]
*  like five years where I couldn't do anything other than MTV. And it was because they had a few people [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3391.48s)]
*  that became really famous off MTV and then left. And so they had decided that MTV is going to keep [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3397.56s)]
*  all of their talent. Which is the funniest thing because when I got there in 87, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3404.44s)]
*  VJs were expendable. They're like, you're expendable. Shut up. Now they couldn't because [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3411.56s)]
*  they brought me over from Europe and I had a two-year contract. I think the first year was 150 [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3418.68s)]
*  grand. The second year was 175 grand. And I got a car service. And I could do radio, any radio I [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3423.72s)]
*  wanted to do. And so a lot of the people, not they, but a lot of the people at the office really [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3431.08s)]
*  disliked me because they'd be like, cut your hair. I'm like, no, I'm not going to cut my hair. Why [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3437.08s)]
*  are they wanting to cut your hair? They have a new creative direction for the channel. I'm like, no. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3441.9599999999996s)]
*  And I had different lengths of hair throughout the years. That's the 80s, man. That hair was [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3447.24s)]
*  like, have you seen the artists we're playing? Let me give you a photo of Adam Kurian, 88. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3453.48s)]
*  It's glorious. I have the hair of generation X. Don't call me a boomer. Look at that. Come on, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3459.96s)]
*  who the fuck would tell you to cut that Farrah Fawcett? That's a beautiful head of hair. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3466.12s)]
*  That's an amazing- Good times, brother. Good times. Yeah. Imagine someone telling you that [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=3471.48s)]

*  would I do that? That's why I wore this hoodie, iron sharpens iron. That's, that's what you are, [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4040.36s)]
*  brother. You know, you, you get, bring people in iron sharpens iron. So a friend sharpens a friend. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4044.28s)]
*  You're always, you know, I come here, I come here because I want to learn from Joe. I want my iron [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4049.96s)]
*  to be sharpened by Joe. You do that with everybody who's there. Well, I just want whoever's in that [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4053.88s)]
*  seat to do the best they can. Right? So like whatever, whatever it is, whether, whether you're [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4059.0s)]
*  talking about quantum physics or whether you're talking about human psychology or ancient history, [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4063.88s)]
*  I want the best version of you. And I want to like, kind of help you get the best version out. And if [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4068.92s)]
*  you're running for president, I'd like to get the best version of that for you. And I think that [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4074.04s)]
*  the whole system of, of debates and public speeches and interviews is so bad for getting [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4079.4s)]
*  to know a human being. And I guarantee you, like I've seen interviews where she's really funny. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4089.7200000000003s)]
*  I've seen this one, I've talked about it before, but I'll say it again. This is one interview. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4095.08s)]
*  She's talking about meeting her mother-in-law for the first time and her mother-in-law, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4098.76s)]
*  grab her face like, Oh, you're so beautiful. It's very funny. And she laughs and she laughs [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4102.2s)]
*  in a genuine way. It's not like that sort of defensive laughter that she does sometimes [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4107.56s)]
*  where it seems like it's orchestrated. It was a genuine laughter and it was fun. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4112.76s)]
*  Well, she's a prosecutor. That's why she kept going into prosecutorial mode, the same with [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4116.68s)]
*  the so-called debate with Trump. She was prosecuting him. So she has a switch that she just the right [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4121.96s)]
*  and then she becomes an authority. And then she wears our president, you know, he's kind of him [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4128.280000000001s)]
*  all the time. They're eating the dogs. I think that won him the election too. That was awesome. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4134.28s)]
*  I mean, that's one of my favorite jingles of all time. They're eating the dogs. Are you kidding me? [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4138.599999999999s)]
*  This is that, that just like that. That's fantastic. Well, it is, it's very interesting to watch. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4143.5599999999995s)]
*  It all takes place. It's very interesting to watch this shifting of the [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4151.0s)]
*  consciousness of the country. The culture. Yeah. And, but also to see the reaction on the left, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4157.96s)]
*  to see the really crazy people, like those people that Worcester town hall thing. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4163.639999999999s)]
*  It's interesting to see that too, because you're going to see these like really exaggerated grasps [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4168.679999999999s)]
*  at retaining relevancy. Like really exactly. Well, they're crying out for help is what they're doing. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4175.719999999999s)]
*  They're crying out for help. They've been Psy-op. I mean, I'm only on X. I gave up Facebook and [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4181.16s)]
*  Instagram. I'm not interested. And X I really only use as kind of an inbox. You know, people will [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4187.959999999999s)]
*  send me stuff and things for the show. But early on when blue cry was still a secret project within [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4193.639999999999s)]
*  Twitter, the Jack Dorsey was running. I knew some people who were in that secret project. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4202.36s)]
*  And so I have an account and I went on there the other day. I'm like, Oh my Lord, this is horrible. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4207.24s)]
*  These people are spinning up and spinning out and just going nuts with each other. It's, and I was [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4213.879999999999s)]
*  like, I don't know how we have to figure out a way. And, you know, President Trump says success [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4220.28s)]
*  will bring us together. I think that's probably true. But you know, we can't just I'm a little [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4228.5199999999995s)]
*  worried that we're all going to be stomping on them. You know, it's like, look at these stupid [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4235.4s)]
*  libs looking out. They're idiots. They're crazy. And I just feel that, you know, you gotta, you gotta [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4239.48s)]
*  love them and not hate them. You don't have to forget what they've done or what they've said, [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4245.719999999999s)]
*  but they have been abused by multiple entities and systems within our own government and political [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4249.48s)]
*  organizations. Yeah. Also during this feedback loop, this chamber and they don't have outside [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4256.839999999999s)]
*  people that are kind and you know, everybody outside is the enemy and they're trying to like, [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4263.48s)]
*  they're trying to make their way through life like all of us, but without forgiveness, [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4270.599999999999s)]
*  you don't, you have nothing like you have to be able to forgive people. Yes, you have to. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4274.5199999999995s)]
*  Without that, there's nothing like, well, you remain trapped in your own prison. Yeah. And [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4279.16s)]
*  you're also, you have enemies forever that could have been your friends. There's no reason for it. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4283.5599999999995s)]
*  It's not good for you. It's not good for them. And it's just like this stubborn inclination that [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4288.76s)]
*  a lot of people have to stick with that. Like, fuck those people forever for life. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4293.72s)]
*  You really shouldn't do that. It's not good. Well, especially if those people feel bad, [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4298.36s)]
*  if they apologize and they realize they've made mistakes. Yeah, like that's what life's about. You [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4302.5199999999995s)]
*  got to be able to understand that in the past, you've made mistakes and grow. And if we, the [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4307.96s)]
*  people that have made mistakes and grown, do not accept the people that are currently making [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4313.4800000000005s)]
*  mistakes and growing, well, then we're hypocrites. Well, that's the same with COVID. You know, [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4317.96s)]
*  I know many people who either lost their job or were forced to take something they didn't want to [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4322.44s)]
*  take and they, they will never forgive them. Like I won't forget. Now, forgiving is not the same as [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4328.2s)]
*  forgetting, obviously, but they can't bring themselves to forgive those who were caught up [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4335.16s)]
*  in a massive psychological operation and they are, they're held in their own prison of anger. And [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4341.88s)]
*  it's with their own family members. I mean, that it's almost like, did that happen? That just went, [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4348.2s)]
*  we're now back. What are we doing? All these things have gone so fast. We, you know, we had [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4353.32s)]
*  an attempt on a president's life and it's like, we don't know anything and all the, what, what, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4358.599999999999s)]
*  what just, I mean, we're like, our heads are on a swivel spinning around, like what is going on? [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4364.28s)]
*  And I think, and the drones, you know, the drones, so the drone thing for me, it was so, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4369.16s)]
*  first of all, there's a base over there and they, they're testing some, some drone technology, but [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4376.44s)]
*  people in the United States, but really around the world, this is how we go through life. We go [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4381.88s)]
*  through life looking down. I'm a pilot, I fly helicopters, airplanes. I'm looking up at the sky [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4386.12s)]
*  all the time. There's a lot going on. There's a lot happening in the sky. And then the minute, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4391.08s)]
*  so what have you seen all kinds of things, Joe, I've seen the starlink satellites go over my house. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4395.5599999999995s)]
*  Those trip people out. It's amazing. It's like, whoa, and you know, like eight or nine and roll [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4401.0s)]
*  up like, whoa, very fast. And they seem pretty low actually, like 60 miles up and like, um, [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4405.5599999999995s)]
*  but, and of course, you know, once it becomes a story, then every, I know all these people [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4412.5199999999995s)]
*  with drones, they're like, dude, I'm going to get in the news. I'm flying my drone. They got [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4418.52s)]
*  six foot diameter drones flying around. Of course. I mean, aliens and Chinese drones, [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4422.040000000001s)]
*  they always want to have their red and green anti-collision lights on. It's important. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4427.72s)]
*  I was like, no, no. And of course there was some, you know, some actual, um, legislation that they [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4433.320000000001s)]
*  wanted to pass, which happened that same week, which was to get a Chinese drones out of America. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4438.68s)]
*  The DJI drones, they don't want them. Um, they want to get past that the same week that this is [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4445.16s)]
*  going on, same week, same week. That's, that's why they PsyOpt all of these local people. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4450.12s)]
*  And they're all there. Yes. Oh yeah. It was, it was, it was these motherfuckers. Yeah. They wanted [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4457.32s)]
*  the DJI DJI drones no longer to come in and, you know, but really for, for law enforcement to also [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4462.599999999999s)]
*  have local authority over drones, which they didn't have. And now they have, they're going to [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4469.88s)]
*  have that as well. So they can say, Hey, you with the drone down, we're doing something important [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4474.52s)]
*  here. So it's always to remove your freedom. Trust me. Whatever the sign. Yeah. That was the [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4479.24s)]
*  same time. And all I had to, I looked at this and like, okay, I'm trained myself like, Oh, [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4484.76s)]
*  let's go take a look. What's going on. Oh, that's interesting. Isn't it? Well, this is another [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4489.8s)]
*  argument for deregulation too, because when it comes to innovation, the issue with drones [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4494.84s)]
*  is that if you want like a really high level, sophisticated drone in America, you have to have [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4500.84s)]
*  a pilot's license. You do. Yeah. This is, this is a, that's a big deal. And the FAA is very involved [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4504.68s)]
*  in the policing of what you need that. I mean, you need that for our skies. Oh, 100%. Yeah. China [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4511.96s)]
*  don't have that, bro. They just, they got a social credit score system. And if you know, I talk to, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4517.96s)]
*  I talk to a lot of guys who do our audience, who just got people in every, you know, we've trained [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4523.4s)]
*  them, your producers, you know, something about one particular topic. You have an obligation to [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4528.2s)]
*  let us know. So we have all these guys, drone for hobbies, drones for law enforcement, drones for [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4532.84s)]
*  news. And they all said, you know, these DJI drones, they're so much better than the U S drones. They're [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4538.12s)]
*  just better. They got better stuff, better technology, better cameras. So they, you know, [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4544.92s)]
*  they're like, I don't want to lose this. And, you know, I guess the thing is without the free market, [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4550.12s)]
*  the innovation is going to be stifled. If the innovation is only available to the highest level [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4555.16s)]
*  military contractors, that's crazy. Like, especially when it comes to drone technology, like you're [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4559.48s)]
*  competing with China and they're doing these enormous light shows with a fucking dragon flying [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4565.32s)]
*  through the sky. Have you seen some of those things? I saw, I've seen them fall out and hit people. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4570.12s)]
*  Oh, gotta crack a few eggs if you want to make an omelet out of them. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4573.56s)]
*  I'm glad I don't go to drone shows for this very reason, Joe. I'm careful. I'm careful. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4578.6s)]
*  That's probably like those air shows where they fly jets around. Like I'm not going to be on the [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4582.4400000000005s)]
*  ground. No, I don't go to those. That's why I like Starlink because Starlink is really first and [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4587.0s)]
*  foremost, a military system. And, and very smartly, I think Elon is very good at marketing. It's like, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4592.92s)]
*  let's give this to the people. You know, so that's everyone. I mean, I have it as a backup at home. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4600.68s)]
*  I have fiber, but I have a Starlink. Of course I want to have this, but it's really a military [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4605.64s)]
*  system. Dude, I took one with me to the mountains in Utah when I went hunting. Worked perfectly. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4610.360000000001s)]
*  It's the size of this pad. Yeah, the to go, the little, the little to go thing. It's incredible. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4614.52s)]
*  You can make phone calls, you can do FaceTime, all from the mountains, the middle of nowhere. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4618.76s)]

*  about, you know, wouldn't it be great if we all these satellites and they're circling around and [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4629.96s)]
*  we call it the data belt and we'd have all this stuff and, you know, all these things. I can just [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4633.8s)]
*  see the delight of, and of course a lot of it's, you know, SpaceX, these are very sophisticated [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4638.68s)]
*  NASA people, you know, it's all kind of the best of the best is in there. I think he knows how to [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4646.92s)]
*  hire the right people. And, but he's smart at how he markets that he really is. I mean, [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4650.76s)]
*  the newest thing is they've teamed up with T-Mobile. So they're saw that. Yeah. So you [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4656.6s)]
*  have Starlink compatible phones only Joe. Right. So you've gone to flip phone now. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4660.4400000000005s)]
*  I've gone to flip. Yeah. So are you texting me on that thing? No, I tech, we do it on signal. So I [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4665.96s)]
*  do that from my computer. Oh, yeah. You're a weirdo. So now you've gone completely flip phone. So you [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4671.240000000001s)]
*  don't text anybody anymore. No, I can text. I can text message, but we've, but it's like T nine. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4677.0s)]
*  No, no, there's actually, so I still have my graphene OS, which is the D Google stuff. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4681.72s)]
*  And that, no, you can't put that on here. So this is Android, but all I really have on here is [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4687.32s)]
*  text messaging RCS. Yeah. So I'm still a green bubble. This is a big flip. $63. And it's from [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4692.52s)]
*  Caterpillar, baby. Whoa. So this is like for job sites. Yeah. Yeah. Your battery lasts a year. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4699.96s)]
*  How long is the battery? Literally two days. If I don't charge it keeps going. Oh yeah. It's [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4705.48s)]
*  no problem. And so this is Android and you have a touch screen. Yeah. Yeah. If you, [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4709.4s)]
*  if you text, it pops up now, it's the whole thing is it's hard to use. And that's why I like it [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4714.44s)]
*  because I don't want it's a trap. Well, reading your text messages is a trip. What am I saying? [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4722.28s)]
*  Nothing. They're so small. This is crazy. Yeah. How do you get back? Use the, the back button [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4728.36s)]
*  on the keyboard. Oh my God. That's hilarious. So this is hilarious. So in a pinch, I can bring [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4735.8s)]
*  up a webpage in a pinch. I can bring up my email. Right. But it makes it complicated. Yeah. So I'm, [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4741.8s)]
*  I'm hindering myself so that I'm not enslaved to it. And actually I hear from, from our daughters, [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4747.8s)]
*  you know, that there's a lot of kids who are doing this now, they, they, cause they want to be more [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4755.24s)]
*  present. So if you want to send a text message, like if you want to get into your messages, [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4759.4800000000005s)]
*  what are you using to send a text message? Oh, here I'll show you. Are you doing like T9? [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4764.04s)]
*  No, no, no, no. So you're typing, you have a little tiny keyboard. Look emojis, [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4768.6s)]
*  little emojis for my wife. See you just hit that and then up pops the keyboard, [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4773.72s)]
*  but you can also swipe. So you can just swipe, swipe around. Oh my God, this keyboard is hilarious. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4778.92s)]
*  You can also, you can also do, I'm going to try to write hello. Hello. My wife will be like, [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4784.6s)]
*  what's going on? Yeah. It's probably auto completing. This is terrible. Yeah. You got it. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4789.0s)]
*  I have it in swipe mode. So just swipe along the letters. Yeah. Just yeah. No. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4793.0s)]
*  High sense. No, didn't work. I have fat ass fingers too, man. This is not going to work. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4800.2s)]
*  It's, it's not easy. And, uh, but I, you know, it's like, I just need to, [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4804.28s)]
*  I like talking to people now too. Like it's, it's a great phone for talking to people. Yeah. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4811.0s)]
*  Talking to people is better. And you know, what's cool. Do you have navigation on this thing? No. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4815.24s)]
*  Well, I could put it on there, but it won't work. But you know, you talk to someone like, [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4818.76s)]
*  yes, satisfying. Yeah, that is satisfying. As it look, has little alerts. If I get a text message, [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4824.76s)]
*  so I can see. So if somebody tells you, Hey, the meeting got moved to 10 PM, I don't have meetings, [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4830.360000000001s)]
*  Joe. Our dinner reservations get changed. You'll get it. Yeah. You know, it's a Dvorak, my, [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4835.08s)]
*  my partner, no agenda. He, uh, he literally has a phone in his drawer and he never takes it out. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4844.28s)]
*  He has decided, no, I don't use navigation. He lives in San Francisco. He wants to, [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4850.92s)]
*  you know, wants to keep his mind sharp by driving around. And he says, whenever I need a phone, [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4856.84s)]
*  I just turn around to someone and say, Hey man, can I use your phone for a second? There's always [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4860.92s)]
*  someone with a phone. He says, so if I really needed to look something up, I just ask him for [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4864.5199999999995s)]
*  it. And it's good to go. It, you know, you get the feeling that you need this thing, [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4869.4s)]
*  but you really don't. Well, you definitely don't. If you have a laptop and spend dedicated time [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4876.2s)]
*  doing certain things, especially like if you, I can't keep up with emails, it's impossible. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4882.599999999999s)]
*  It just doesn't, it doesn't make sense. That's basically all I do. I can't do it. It doesn't [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4887.719999999999s)]
*  work. I have filtering and all kinds of stuff. There's like people who will email me 15 times [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4891.96s)]
*  a day. And well, the thing is of those 15 messages, there's one gem in there. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4897.64s)]
*  So you have to check them every day. Otherwise in three days, you've got 45 messages. That [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4904.12s)]
*  doesn't make any sense. How many? 45, a hundred, 45, a hundred messages. Oh yeah. But I, but I put [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4908.200000000001s)]
*  him in his own email box. And so then, you know, like when I'm prepping for the show, like, no, [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4915.320000000001s)]
*  no, no, no, I can just see, maybe check that out. Yeah. So I'm a real, that's a, I'm a real [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4921.16s)]
*  information manager. That's by the way, I am not a big believer in the benefits of AI at this moment, [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4927.8s)]
*  but if it can fix my email, then I'll believe it. And so far, no one's done that with email. How [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4935.8s)]
*  could it possibly fix your email? It should know what I want to see and what's relevant to me based [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4940.76s)]
*  upon how about the transcript of my show? Or I mean, all these wonderful inputs I can give it, [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4945.08s)]
*  how come it can't do that? It's no one has fixed email for me. When you do that, then I'll be a [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4949.96s)]
*  little more, a little more of a believer in AI. Right now. I think it's a great parlor trick. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4956.2s)]
*  I think it's keeping the stock market afloat. You know, we've gone through three AI winters, [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4961.4800000000005s)]
*  even has his own Wiki page, AI winter. It comes and goes, you know, at a certain point it was [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4967.64s)]
*  list was the programming language. And then, you know, that went away and then funding dries up. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4973.56s)]
*  And, you know, now it's like, what, we don't really need $100 million to build a model. Oh, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4977.8s)]
*  but wait a minute. They stole that from you. So you can copy. I run these models at home [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4983.64s)]
*  on my own computer. I run the llama model, which is a meta. They've open sourced it. I've run the [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4989.72s)]
*  French one, whatever their frog model, whatever they call it. And, and then deep seek, you can [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=4997.24s)]
*  also just load that on your own computer. And it's not very impressive. I mean, it's just not the, [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5003.4s)]
*  the error rate is too high. So I'm, I'm skeptical of it really taking off. And I certainly don't [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5008.5199999999995s)]
*  think it's sentient or anything of that kind. I think it's on its way. And I think also the versions [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5014.599999999999s)]
*  that we're getting are not the versions they're currently working on. And the people that I know [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5021.799999999999s)]
*  that are in the loop at the highest levels of AI are alarmed, including Elon. I had a conversation [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5026.84s)]
*  with Elon. We went to, we were in line together to go to church the day of the inauguration. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5033.96s)]
*  It just happened to be right next to him. And we just walked through together. I'm like, Hey, [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5039.88s)]
*  what's up? And that's all I wanted to talk about was the leaps that Grok AI is making. And he's [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5043.08s)]
*  like, it's like weekly, we're shocked. And I think this thing is exponential. And when they start [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5049.8s)]
*  attaching large language models to quantum computing, it's going to get very, very weird. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5059.08s)]
*  That's the pivot I'm waiting for when people start coming, man. And that's going to be like an [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5064.76s)]
*  asteroid hitting the Yucatan. You know, we've been waiting for quantum computers to actually work for [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5069.24s)]
*  30 years and it's always 10 years away. And right now it's 10 years away. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5075.8s)]
*  Yeah. But right now they're able to do things with them. You know, they're able to solve [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5079.8s)]
*  very complicated algorithms. One, there was, I'm not an expert in this, but there was one [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5083.4s)]
*  computation they did. And you know, that may be a computation it could do. It's not necessary [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5089.72s)]
*  that you can give it any computation. But you know that the computations that it's doing are [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5095.72s)]
*  so insanely complex that they believe it's proof of the multiverse. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5100.68s)]
*  Yeah, I've heard this. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5104.2s)]
*  Yeah. You're not, you're not buying it. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5105.240000000001s)]
*  No, not at all. No, not for a second. No, because I... [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5107.0s)]
*  How dare you. I know I'm a Luddite. I'm a Luddite. Look at me. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5111.56s)]
*  How dare you crush my dreams. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5115.0s)]
*  I believe in this. I've got no smoke signal in my car. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5115.4800000000005s)]
*  For a number of reasons. One is I'm not using it. I am, I am the techno guy. I've always been [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5120.2s)]
*  early in computers, early in the internet, and I just can't find the use for it. When I find it, [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5126.84s)]
*  it does some simple things. It's very good at language. Honestly, if I'm looking, if I was like, [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5132.44s)]
*  okay, here's my situation. I'm looking for Bible scripture. It'll come up with something good. And [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5137.32s)]
*  then I can say, and read it to me like a, like a Baptist pastor. And it'll go, hey, brother, [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5141.639999999999s)]
*  you know, he'll do all that stuff. But okay, you know, it has all of the translations of the [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5148.36s)]
*  Bible in it. And so it can, it can predict reasonably what scripture will work. It's [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5154.44s)]
*  usually not all that great. It can do term papers. It can do, you know, we're in a position now where [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5159.08s)]
*  people are putting their resume into chat GPT, sending it off, you know, thousands of people [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5164.76s)]
*  are sending off for a job. And the other end, the people are taking that resume, putting it in a chat [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5170.04s)]
*  GPT and saying, please summarize this resume. I mean, that's insane. It's like, what are we doing [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5174.28s)]
*  here? That doesn't make any sense. If it can fix my email, that'd be very impressed. That's all I [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5180.36s)]
*  want. That's all I ask for. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5185.64s)]
*  Your email is a particular puzzle though. That's the thing. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5186.44s)]
*  Everyone's email is a puzzle. It's like, you know, the spammers get around stuff and they figure it [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5188.36s)]
*  out and you, you say report a spam, then it comes back in a different way. And, you know, every, [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5193.48s)]
*  and how many older people, especially, but even people our age who get scammed by, you know, [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5198.839999999999s)]
*  these emails that look pretty convincing. And then the minute you click, you know, then you're, [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5207.719999999999s)]
*  they're like, oh, I should put my password in and then, then you gone, you're done. There was, [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5213.0s)]
*  there's a phone scam going around right now, which is unbelievable. They had me going for 15 minutes. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5217.64s)]
*  I got a call. It was eight o'clock in the morning, right at eight o'clock. And I'm about to walk the [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5223.64s)]
*  dog. So I press it to voicemail. I come back, I listen, this is the sheriff from Travis County [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5228.44s)]
*  and had a five one two number. And, you know, I need to talk to you urgently. I'm like, okay, [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5237.32s)]
*  this is kind of messed up. I call back. I get, I get someone, oh, I want sheriff so and so. Yeah, [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5242.04s)]
*  hold on a second. We'll transfer. I'm hearing, you know, like police radio chatter in the [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5246.92s)]
*  background. The guy gets on and he's saying, well, you were an expert witness. You were called to be [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5251.16s)]
*  an expert witness in a case. I just happened to, and maybe this is not coincidence. I was asked to [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5256.92s)]
*  testify on someone's behalf in a, in a case. And so you were supposed to be an expert witness in this [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5261.0s)]
*  case. You didn't show up. So, you know, you've basically broken federal law and, you know, [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5266.76s)]
*  we have to come and pick you up and we have to, you know, or you can pay a fine. And, [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5273.08s)]
*  and then I'm like, okay. And it, and it just kept on going. And I'm like, whoa, hold on a second. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5277.88s)]
*  Sounded so real. And then at a certain point, he's like, well, you need to go, you need to get a [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5284.44s)]
*  coupon to send this money. I'm like, I'm going to call my lawyer. You can't call your lawyer. I have [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5289.5599999999995s)]
*  a do not hang up order. I have to walk you through the whole process. I'm like, okay, now I got it. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5293.72s)]
*  But that was 10, 15 minutes later and a lot of people have fallen for this one. It's, it's good. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5300.04s)]
*  Super sophisticated. Very sophisticated. So is that overseas? Are they like spoofing a number? [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5306.2s)]
*  No, I mean, these were American voices. It sounded like a sheriff. It really did. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5311.08s)]
*  And the deputy sounded like a deputy. I mean, it was sophisticated. It's good. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5315.96s)]
*  How much was the fine? Like, uh, 3000 for this, for this infraction and 2000 for that infraction, [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5321.08s)]
*  for these two different things. And then you're going to bank transfer. So they're going to get [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5328.5199999999995s)]
*  your bank numbers. But I mean, at that point I, I caught on like, no, hold on a second. How'd you get [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5331.72s)]
*  off of it? I said, I'm going to call my lawyer. And he's like, no, no. I'm like, you can't tell [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5337.24s)]
*  me I can't call my lawyer. This is bull crap. And then, and I had to calm down. I'm like, I said to [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5341.32s)]
*  Tina, I said, listen to what just happened to me. This is crazy. Some people I know in our, in our, [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5346.28s)]
*  in Fredericksburg actually went all the way. Wow. Yeah. The older people, you know, [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5352.44s)]
*  and they were afraid. They're like, oh, of course authority. That's how they get you. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5357.799999999999s)]
*  I'm sure you've got the, the one that says, uh, this is my favorite Bitcoin scam. It's like, uh, [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5363.0s)]
*  okay, I've installed a spyware on your computer and I saw what you were doing looking at that porn [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5369.0s)]
*  site and I've recorded everything and I'm going to release it all to your, to your friends and on [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5374.759999999999s)]
*  your social media. If you don't send me $2,000 in Bitcoin right away, don't even think about [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5379.8s)]
*  contacting the authorities. Have you gotten that one? No, they've sophisticated it even more. Now [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5385.16s)]
*  will the, they'll use your name and your address. Like I know you live at this address. It's, [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5389.72s)]
*  it's freaky, man. So that kind of stuff will be nice if we could have AI protect us from that. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5396.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. If it can do all these wonderful things, focus on that, help people, save people. Now, [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5401.88s)]
*  cut out the scam. Yeah. Speaking of scamming, what do you think about shit coins? [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5407.8s)]
*  Like what's, what's your take on like Hawk to a coin? Okay. Melania coin and [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5414.5199999999995s)]
*  those are more mean, more meme coins, um, shit coins, right? Isn't that what a meme coin is? [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5419.48s)]
*  So the only coin I believe in is Bitcoin. And we've talked about this before, right? In fact, [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5424.68s)]
*  I looked it up hoping you would bring it up two years ago when I was here the last time Bitcoin [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5429.72s)]
*  was around $40,000 today. It's close to a hundred thousand dollars. This, this will continue to go [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5434.84s)]
*  up until we're long gone. Um, it's very interesting. So I don't believe in, in shit coins at all, [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5440.92s)]
*  because if you have Bitcoin has no CEO, there's no one in charge of it. It's literally tens of [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5448.2s)]
*  thousands of people around the world who run these nodes that make it open and make it run and keep [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5454.04s)]
*  it at this 21 million coin limit. I'm totally down with Bitcoin. I'm with you. Good. But [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5459.64s)]
*  I think the shit coin thing is fascinating that anybody can create a coin. Yeah. You know, like [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5466.280000000001s)]
*  Jamie has a pull it up Jamie coin. I don't know if you know that. Well, but you not make it, [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5472.04s)]
*  don't put that on me. You do not. It's out there now. I mean, now that you just said it, now that [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5476.4400000000005s)]
*  we just said it, because we brought it up yesterday with the Boneyard guy, with John Reeves. And uh, [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5481.4800000000005s)]
*  we said, you should have your own coin, get it the Boneyard coin. And now apparently somebody made [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5485.88s)]
*  one. So this is, you bring this up in context of scams because they are scams the way it was. So [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5489.56s)]
*  if I wanted to make a quick, quick amount of money, I'd have a shit coin and have my bots [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5497.16s)]
*  ready. And I'd say, Hey Joe, have you heard about my, my curry coin? And you'd be like, no, wait, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5503.0s)]
*  and it would come out and it would skyrocket. My bots would sell it. I would make a lot of money [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5507.96s)]
*  and it would be dumped right away. It's a scam over and over and over. What if you don't sell it? [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5512.12s)]
*  Yeah. Then you'll have a empty bits worth nothing. But if you, so it's only available for pump and [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5517.64s)]
*  dumps. That's what, that's the only thing it's good for. It's, it's not good for anything else. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5524.04s)]
*  What about if you wanted to use it to finance charity? Is it possible? Bad idea. Bad idea. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5528.44s)]
*  Yeah. Um, you know, a lot of charities now, they will accept Bitcoin. And why is that good? Because [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5535.64s)]
*  people have Bitcoin and I have some Bitcoin, you know, I've, I've been saving my Bitcoin for a long [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5542.2s)]
*  time instead of selling it to which I then have to pay capital gains over the difference between [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5546.2s)]
*  what I bought it for and sold it at, I can give it to the charity. I can still take my, my tax [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5551.64s)]
*  deductible right off. They can do one of two things. They can convert it right away into dollars, [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5556.68s)]
*  no capital gains because it's the same, the same minute. So I've actually been able to give more [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5561.8s)]
*  than I would have or, oops, or they can, um, they can sell some of it and hold some of it [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5566.52s)]
*  for a longer term. I really, really believe in Bitcoin and what we're seeing now, [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5572.68s)]
*  there is something interesting going on. Uh, our dollar is in big, big trouble and president Trump [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5578.68s)]
*  knows this. This, this falls into kind of the tariffs, uh, talk. Um, have you heard about stable [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5585.080000000001s)]
*  coins? No. Okay. Do you mind if I just give a little, our monetary system, it really started [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5591.4s)]
*  after world war two, 1944. Um, we were nearing the end of the war D-Day was coming or maybe it just [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5598.04s)]
*  happened. It was, we're getting pretty close and, um, uh, Europe in particular was very worried that [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5604.36s)]
*  after the war, they would fall into the same great depression that happened after world war one. And [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5610.36s)]
*  we had the great depression. So they brought in all the, uh, all the economists and all the money [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5614.839999999999s)]
*  people got on the queen Mary and went to the States to Bretton Woods. You've heard of Bretton [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5620.52s)]
*  Woods, probably the Bretton Woods system. Okay. So Bretton Woods is just this resort. They all got [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5624.76s)]
*  together and they decided that they would have a new monetary system for the entire world. I'm not [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5630.200000000001s)]
*  an economist, but I've looked at this long enough to understand it. And, um, when they came out after [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5635.64s)]
*  two weeks, he said, okay, we're going to have this thing called the international monetary fund, the [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5641.0s)]
*  IMF, and they're going to, uh, manage the interest rates or they manage the currency exchange between [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5645.4s)]
*  all the individual countries with the U S dollar as the reserve currency. So we became the money of [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5652.92s)]
*  the world and we back it by gold. And the idea was one dollar could always be exchanged for 35 ounces [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5659.08s)]
*  of gold. And you know, when you're the reserve currency, everyone has to have the dollar. So [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5666.679999999999s)]
*  everybody wanted our dollar. What did we do? We signed the Marshall plan. We sent tens, you know, [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5672.92s)]
*  just billions of dollars over all our companies went into Europe, started building factories. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5679.08s)]
*  And, and, you know, so all, so the dollar kept going in all these other currencies kind of came [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5684.68s)]
*  a little bit weaker because we were so strong with our money. And then people got a little worried [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5689.64s)]
*  about the dollar. They looked around and went like, Hey, do you guys have the gold to back that up in [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5694.84s)]
*  Fort Knox? Of course we didn't cause we just kept printing money and sending it over. And then you [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5698.52s)]
*  get into this thing called the, the Triffin dilemma. And that means that when you are the reserve [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5703.400000000001s)]
*  currency, your currency is basically overvalued and you can't export anything. And that's exactly, [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5709.320000000001s)]
*  I'm skipping over a lot, but that's where we are today. Our products are too expensive to ship to [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5715.96s)]
*  China and sell in China because of the value of our dollar. This is why president Trump is saying, [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5721.4800000000005s)]
*  Hey, all our money is flowing out towards you. We need to get some of that back. So we're going to [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5726.68s)]
*  raise tariffs. I think it's a short-term solution. So I think two things will happen. One is we have [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5732.84s)]
*  this sovereign wealth fund, which you've heard him talk about the sovereign wealth fund. So in that [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5740.76s)]
*  will be the value of, you know, our, our public land that the government owns and all kinds of [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5747.0s)]
*  other things that will be valued at this astronomical amount. And in that will also be the strategic [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5752.92s)]
*  Bitcoin reserve that the president promised. Now we get stable coins. This is, this is a crazy, [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5757.24s)]
*  crazy thing that's happened. There's this, so stable coin is a digital dollar. It's, it's pegged [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5764.76s)]
*  to the dollar. So it's always a dollar and you can pay with this through the internet, through, [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5771.24s)]
*  you know, apps and everything. It's already being used all over the world. The only reason it's [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5775.64s)]
*  worth a dollar is because the stable coin company that creates it, they have debt and paper to back [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5781.64s)]
*  it up. So they buy America's debt. They get treasury bonds or T bills, which actually pays [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5788.52s)]
*  a dividends. You get interest on that. And for each dollar they have bought in treasuries, [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5797.320000000001s)]
*  they can create a stable coin. So if you look at the company Tether, they have bought more of the [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5803.08s)]
*  United States debt than most countries. They have $160 billion worth of US debt. And for each of [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5809.64s)]
*  those dollars, they've created a stable coin, which now people can use all over the world, [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5817.8s)]
*  transacting. And what's their business? There's like 50 people in the company. So they have $160 [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5822.68s)]
*  billion at 4% interest annually. They're making bank just for, just for holding this debt. So I [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5829.08s)]
*  think President Trump is very smart and he's seen that we can flood the world with our stable coin. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5837.0s)]
*  And you kind of get a two for one. So you create a dollar of debt, but then you create another dollar [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5843.16s)]
*  on top that can be used all over the world as the reserve currency. And that should probably result [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5849.88s)]
*  in, I don't know, the Mar-a-Lago accord or some new monetary system that we're going to have to [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5856.28s)]
*  come up with to really have our dollar be valued properly, but also still remain the reserve [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5862.52s)]
*  currency and remain the strong export country that we need to be. Because what do we do? [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5869.4800000000005s)]
*  We don't make anything that we sell abroad. We can't all be serving each other burgers and [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5876.280000000001s)]
*  fries and washing each other's cars and cleaning each other's homes. We have to build something. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5883.4800000000005s)]
*  And all of that went overseas. Everything, everything we got, all the stuff on this table. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5888.68s)]
*  This, you know, it didn't come out of his butt. This is from China. Although I don't know. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5893.64s)]
*  So there's something big coming, really big. And it has to happen. And Trump is a very meta guy. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5902.4400000000005s)]
*  People misunderstand. He understands he's going to refi the country. That's what he's a real estate [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5910.280000000001s)]
*  guy. He's going to figure out a way to refi it. And it'll be digital. And a lot of the Bitcoiners [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5915.08s)]
*  don't like this because they like Bitcoin to be the money that the whole world uses. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5921.5599999999995s)]
*  That may one day happen, but now it's more like the digital gold. You can keep your value in it. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5927.24s)]
*  And I can send a billion dollars, if I had it, I could send a billion dollars to another country, [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5935.16s)]
*  to another person in 10 minutes and no one can stop me. So it's a very useful tool, but it hasn't [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5939.32s)]
*  quite turned out to be money or currency the way it was originally intended. But it's going to be [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5946.92s)]
*  a very important part of it. I think you'll see Bitcoin be a part of that strategic reserve. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5952.599999999999s)]
*  It's easier than sending gold, you know, than, oh, I'm going to ship you a billion dollars [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5958.5199999999995s)]
*  worth of gold. I need, you know, armored cars, I need dudes, everything, security and ships and [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5962.84s)]
*  whatever. So it'll be a part of it. And you'll still be able to use it between people. But [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5968.92s)]
*  it looks to me like stablecoin, Tether in particular, is going to be the future of the US dollar [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5978.6s)]
*  payments. And this is where a lot of people on the right, certainly, are very afraid of [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5986.28s)]
*  control grid, you know, because a stablecoin is not necessarily like Bitcoin, you can stop it, [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=5994.5199999999995s)]
*  you can control it, you can see who sent what to whom. There's a lot of fear about this. And [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6000.12s)]
*  particularly, although I don't see any maliciousness, this fear that Elon and the PayPal mafia and Peter [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6006.12s)]
*  Teal, all guys you've met, all guys you've had on the show, I think are actually quite nice people, [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6013.4s)]
*  that they're going to bring in the new with AI and we're all going to be locked in and, you know, [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6018.12s)]
*  Stargate will bring cancer mRNA vaccines that will be mandated. I mean, people are spinning [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6023.719999999999s)]
*  up over this stuff. And I'm not saying that they necessarily wrong or there should be no concern. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6030.36s)]
*  But we are moving towards a digital dollar and it will have aspects of control, which is why [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6035.96s)]
*  I like the backup of Bitcoin so I can still transact and do things without anybody being [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6042.12s)]
*  able to stop it. And you're going to get none of that with a shitcoin. Nothing. When FTX, that [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6047.48s)]
*  scandal, what were they trading in? Was that all meme coins? Was that different cryptos? Is there [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6053.32s)]
*  a difference between meme coins and established crypto coins? Well, an established anything but [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6059.24s)]
*  Bitcoin has someone who can change the ledger, who can change the blockchain. Bitcoin, you can't [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6065.88s)]
*  do that. It's a beautiful system. The checks and balances are immutable. I mean, that's the [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6072.84s)]
*  beauty of Bitcoin. Any other blockchain that is owned or operated by a company or people [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6079.72s)]
*  can be and will be manipulated. And FTX was one of those. What I believe FTX was really used for [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6086.68s)]
*  was slush fund into Democrat Party and politician, not just there also to some Republicans as well. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6095.32s)]
*  That kid, that Sam Bankman Fried, he got abused by his parents, I think. I'm just alleging this. I [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6102.2s)]
*  don't want to get sued over it. But when you see what was going on there and the money that was [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6107.16s)]
*  just being slushed right through into different foundations. Those parents were Democratic [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6112.44s)]
*  operatives, right? Big time. They had nonprofits and all kinds of... And he was the number two [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6116.759999999999s)]
*  donor to the Democratic Party, which is crazy. And you're doing that to kind of buy your way [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6122.28s)]
*  through this shenanigans. That's what it seemed like to me. Yeah. Because you're doing shenanigans. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6127.5599999999995s)]
*  And they're all also doing amphetamines and polyamorous relationships in the Bahamas. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6132.12s)]
*  It's a polycule, Joe. It's just a polycule. I mean, it was sad for these kids because they [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6137.8s)]
*  were just all excited and doing stuff. And I mean, I've been in... I've raised money from Kleiner [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6145.24s)]
*  Perkins and Sequoia Capital. And when you get them all googly-gaga over, oh, this guy was so [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6151.72s)]
*  cool. He was sitting in the pitch meeting and he was playing a video game. But he's such a genius. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6159.08s)]
*  I mean, what? Are you kidding me? Right. Venture capital investors are not necessarily the most [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6164.04s)]
*  sophisticated. Well, they want results. And if they're getting results, they'll put on the blinders. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6170.12s)]
*  What I... I was just reading about Elizabeth Holmes. Oh, yeah. I love that story. She got [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6175.4800000000005s)]
*  screwed. She got screwed? Oh, yeah. How so? Well, okay. So she was in a situation where the so-called [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6181.88s)]
*  smartest investors in the world, which included Colin Powell, and everyone was in on this deal. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6190.76s)]
*  Everyone's like, you got to get your money in now. Bring everybody in. We got this big fund. This is [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6197.0s)]
*  going to be it. This is the blood test. It'll change medicine. And they hyped her up. They put [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6202.2s)]
*  her in the magazines. She was looking like the female Steve Jobs. And she got caught up in it. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6208.12s)]
*  But you're taking agency away from her. She changed her voice. She started dressing like Steve Jobs. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6215.24s)]
*  She started lying about results. She fired people that didn't go along with it. Yes. But does she [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6220.5199999999995s)]
*  deserve to go to jail for 10 years for ripping off people who were stupid? Yes. Really? Well, [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6226.76s)]
*  you can't rip people off. I think you have restitution and things that you can do. Hundreds of [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6233.0s)]
*  millions of dollars people lost. That's not restitution. You don't have that money. You're [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6238.2s)]
*  not going to pay it back because your product sucks. So they've dumped all this money and lost. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6243.16s)]
*  It's a civil crime. And there's definitely some blame on the investors. But the investors were [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6247.8s)]
*  too big to look stupid. So I think they pushed a little bit more on her than she does. I'm not [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6254.04s)]
*  trying to defend her falsification. Do you think she should go to jail at all? Yeah. But not for [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6261.0s)]
*  10 years. How long? A couple days? Yeah, just a couple days. Yeah. Just enough to transition, [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6265.08s)]
*  Joe. Just enough to become a dude and then we're good to go. Now, I mean, it's just another example [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6269.56s)]
*  of big money being stupid. And maybe they could just admit that. They pushed her. I know how it [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6278.360000000001s)]
*  goes. I remember we had a pod show, which was a lot of sophisticated investors, Kleiner and Sequoia. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6286.12s)]
*  I met Elon when they launched Tesla. I was at the hangar where they did the first test drives. It [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6297.64s)]
*  was interesting. And I was like, this guy seems like on the spectrum. He's not really talking much. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6305.24s)]
*  What's going on here? What's happening with this? And so we were doing podcasting. So this is right [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6312.679999999999s)]
*  after maybe a year after Steve Jobs put it into iTunes and the iPod. And so there was money coming [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6321.0s)]
*  in. And the first thing they said is, you've got to be in San Francisco. Well, if you want a media [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6328.5199999999995s)]
*  company, where's the last place you want to be in San Francisco? You need to be LA or New York. No, [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6333.16s)]
*  no, no, you got to be here. And why did they want you to be in San Francisco? So they could come and [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6337.72s)]
*  see the office and check out the operation and make sure their money's being spent well. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6342.2s)]
*  How often are they going to visit? Oh, you have no idea. They're always dropping by and like, [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6348.5199999999995s)]
*  what's going on? And so you're doing reports and they just want to hang out with the cool guy. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6353.16s)]
*  Well, that too, maybe. But then, you know, it was definitely a struggle. We were actually [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6357.4s)]
*  kind of profitable for a bit there. But it was, you know, like GoDaddy ads with promo codes, [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6363.48s)]
*  you know, code Bon Geno. I mean, it was like, you know, it was like, yeah, is it are people [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6370.04s)]
*  really listening? Are they just using the codes? And there was there's always a lot of scams. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6374.5199999999995s)]
*  Like the honey scam? [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6380.599999999999s)]
*  Well, no, not like that. No, there's there's scams of, you know, when companies need to, [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6381.88s)]
*  we didn't do this, but when companies need to raise more money in Silicon Valley, [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6386.68s)]
*  then they'll buy some traffic from bots. And I'm sure it happens on with comedy videos to [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6390.4400000000005s)]
*  people like I need some traffic on this video. Let me buy some bots on something. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6395.32s)]
*  You definitely can do that, right? Right, of course. Yeah. But then at a certain point, [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6398.6s)]
*  YouTube had come out, you know, and, oh, YouTube, everyone has to do video now. You got to do video, [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6404.52s)]
*  you can't do audio, got to do video. And then it got even worse. Like we sat in a board meeting, [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6409.24s)]
*  like, have you seen Juiced? Juiced? I'm like, do you remember Juiced? J-O-O-S-T? Oh, yeah. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6414.2s)]
*  There was the guys who built Skype, they built this video platform that was basically a peer [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6420.36s)]
*  to peer streaming television shows. And there was no doubt about it. You've got to go video, [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6425.5599999999995s)]
*  be more like Juiced, make your interface like Juiced. So at a certain point, you're like, [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6432.28s)]
*  well, what am I going to do? Am I going to risk running out of money? Am I going to [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6436.92s)]
*  listen to what they say? Do they really know what they're talking about? And ultimately, [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6441.24s)]
*  you know, the company ran for 10 years and no one exited. You know, it just kind of got folded into [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6445.8s)]
*  other things. So it's not a great investment of their money or my time, honestly. Well, [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6450.84s)]
*  it's kind of amazing that the big video platform is still just YouTube. And now, you know, YouTube [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6456.36s)]
*  just passed Netflix. Now is the most watched thing on television. Oh, they're the big, they're not [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6461.4s)]
*  even counted in the streaming data in the streaming wars. But yeah, they're the big, [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6465.4s)]
*  I have YouTube TV. I don't I cut the cable. I watch I don't have cable anymore. It's like I've just, [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6470.04s)]
*  I watch YouTube on TV more than I watch anything, because there's so much variety. There's so many [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6475.24s)]
*  different things you can search. The fact that you could essentially find anything like if I'm [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6479.4s)]
*  interested in, you know, some particular region of the world of ancient history, I just punch that [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6484.2s)]
*  into YouTube. And I've hundreds of thousands of videos on it. It took them a long time to get I [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6490.2s)]
*  think to make that profitable inside of Google. Because if you if you see how many videos are [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6496.599999999999s)]
*  being uploaded daily and transformed into digital video, and I mean, it's it's crazy the amount of [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6502.28s)]
*  computation that goes into YouTube and the amount of bandwidth that is being sent. So I think it [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6509.72s)]
*  took a long time. They never really reported the numbers. They've only done that in the past couple [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6515.16s)]
*  years or how much revenue now, of course, YouTube is, is making bank. I mean, it's really it's an [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6519.96s)]
*  incredible shocking that no one has come up with anything even remotely close, it would take too [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6525.24s)]
*  much money. It's so much investment that goes into doing that. It's it's, it's a lot. I mean, [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6529.8s)]
*  you remember your bandwidth costs back in the day pre Spotify, you know, think how do you solve that [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6535.32s)]
*  when you have 100 million videos being posted every single day? Yeah, you can't. I mean, you [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6540.68s)]
*  have to have billions of dollars in startup money. And then then you're still struggling to [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6546.28s)]
*  get people to use your app. Like you remember that one company that came up? Was it Quibi? What was [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6551.0s)]
*  it? Yes. Was that what it was? They spent so much money. Was it Katzenberg, Katzenberg and I do not [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6557.0s)]
*  remember. It was a Hollywood thing. It was a Hollywood thing was Quibi. And they got a [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6564.28s)]
*  bunch of famous people to do short short short drama. Yeah, they put $2 billion in and yeah, [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6567.96s)]
*  gone. They blew it real quick. Because you can't can't manufacture something that goes viral. No, [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6575.48s)]
*  you can't. And that's kind of like TikTok. We talked about TikTok last time, I think was here. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6583.24s)]
*  And, you know, obviously, it's not an issue now that China is spying through TikTok, because it's [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6588.839999999999s)]
*  still here. I think as I told you then, I think it's because they were eating Silicon Valley's [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6593.32s)]
*  lunch, you know, doing $4 billion, taking away revenue from them. And just looking at the people [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6598.12s)]
*  who sponsored the bill, it seemed like they had a lot of donations from Google and Amazon, you [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6604.12s)]
*  know, that just seemed to me like there might be some some issues there. But what people misunderstand [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6610.84s)]
*  about TikTok is it's not just about the videos and the format and how it flies by. It's about [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6617.5599999999995s)]
*  the shop. The shop is their magic sauce. The if you look at the back end, the influencers who get [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6625.08s)]
*  paid on TikTok, they have this whole back end with rankings and who sold more stuff. Half the [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6633.24s)]
*  videos on TikTok, once you get out of your algo, half of them are about products. And people are, [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6640.36s)]
*  you know, just selling products. And it's all from China. And it's all been coming in under the $800 [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6645.96s)]
*  de minimis tax regulation. So there's no there's no import duty or anything paid on it. They [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6651.4s)]
*  actually have I think, team you now has warehouses in America. So it's just Chinese crap that we're [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6658.68s)]
*  buying over and over again is wildly successful. It's not really about the ads on on you get ads [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6664.6s)]
*  on TikTok, a lot of ads. I don't use it. Okay, good. Yeah. I got so when it was going to go away, [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6671.56s)]
*  I'm like, I got to get this app, I got to see what happens, you know, it's like, this is going to be [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6677.56s)]
*  crazy. So I get the app. And I'm using my my graphene OS phone so I can lock off all access [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6681.08s)]
*  all it had was my location can't hide that from the IP address and my name. So I'm get TikTok on [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6688.36s)]
*  a graphene phone. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And you can actually block it from accessing your contacts [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6694.52s)]
*  black, black, that was too much for you. You had to go to a flip phone. That's interesting. Well, [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6699.4s)]
*  that was my it's my experimental thing. And so all it knew was Adam Curry in the hill country. And [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6703.8s)]
*  it went I think it went curry black name, hill country is probably about 50 churches where he is, [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6709.88s)]
*  boom, right away. I'm getting black preachers. Bring me hellstone. Oh, yeah. And it's just like [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6717.16s)]
*  an on and on and on. It's been phenomenal. So and some of these guys are pretty good. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6723.08s)]
*  The ones that fall back, you know, it's like the guy catches them every single time. And so their [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6728.599999999999s)]
*  algorithm is just give that person more of what they want. They're not they're not trying to do [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6734.04s)]
*  like us. Like in like, you know, meta or I'm not sure about x how that works. But let me inject [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6739.0s)]
*  some people who are against it or have a counter a counter argument. Like when when I was on the last [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6745.88s)]
*  time I talked about my my coming to Jesus, dude, there were tick tock videos with millions of views [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6752.28s)]
*  of just this, you know, this is one bit. And and if you looked at it one time, it just you get the [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6759.64s)]
*  same over and over again, you get all kinds of Jesus stuff back and forth. That's all not anyone [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6764.84s)]
*  going. Yeah, you guys are crazy. You know, this is no good. None of that. So it's a very friendly. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6769.72s)]
*  It's kind of the Chinese model. It's like, give people what they want and don't try to [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6776.12s)]
*  interject them or spin them up or get them angry and then throw an ad in their face when they're [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6780.84s)]
*  all emotional. So it's very different. It's very different. I don't know if it'll be [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6784.92s)]
*  worth anything to anyone buying it unless you have the shop portion. Without that, I don't know. I [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6790.2s)]
*  don't think they'd have all that to. I mean, you got to have you got to have the products. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6795.32s)]
*  You got to have the cheap Chinese products. That's what that's. That's the problems. Like, [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6800.2s)]
*  do you have that that stuff? I mean, you'd have to still be buying them from China. Yeah, it's [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6804.36s)]
*  fun for you know, for us like, oh, you know, different crazy people. I mean, Dvorak use it [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6809.08s)]
*  all the time. He's he's in an algo of just nut jobs. You know, he's like blue hair. Look at this. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6814.679999999999s)]
*  He plays clips on the show. I'm like, dude, you got you got to do something else with your life [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6820.28s)]
*  during the day. It's just amazing how many of those kooky people are getting so much traction. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6824.68s)]
*  And that was the thought that it was a Chinese Psyop that they were accentuating all these people. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6829.08s)]
*  And that was like ruining the culture of America because it was showing you all these blue haired [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6834.6s)]
*  psychopaths with beards and lipstick and nail polish. It's really so I heard the same thing [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6839.56s)]
*  from I heard people saying, dude, you're wrong. They want to get rid of TikTok because that's [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6844.84s)]
*  where Maga lives. I'm like, huh? And then it was because that's all they got. They got [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6850.68s)]
*  because that's what offends them. Exactly. Exactly. So it's just it's just it's very [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6856.52s)]
*  social media. The Internet in general was kind of a bad idea. It's kind of hurt as good for many [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6862.280000000001s)]
*  things. But there's two sides of the same coin. This good and bad. I mean, why would you say it's [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6868.4400000000005s)]
*  a bad idea, though? I think it's a great idea. Well, I mean, you were just talking about shift [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6873.96s)]
*  the balance of information because of the Psyops. If we're not aware of the Psyops, [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6878.52s)]
*  you know, the DARPA, the Defense Agency Research Project Agency, [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6882.92s)]
*  I had too many agencies in there. DARPA. Yeah. Since the 70s, they've been [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6889.96s)]
*  looking at social networks and really in the there's a there's a guy he can't with the law [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6894.68s)]
*  of large numbers. And they they figured out that in a computer network, regardless of the content, [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6900.68s)]
*  depending on if you have enough nodes, you can predict where the information will flow. So [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6907.24s)]
*  if I'm talking about something here, if they boost the right nodes, they can predict where [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6914.36s)]
*  that information will go. And that's that's how I don't think even Elon can stop that from happening. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6919.719999999999s)]
*  It's not an algorithm thing. It's it's literally like a law of nature thing that just it that's [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6925.88s)]
*  the way it will flow. And you can start injecting things to the right nodes, and you'll propagate [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6932.04s)]
*  some message. And I mean, it I think it's happening all the time everywhere. I mean, [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6937.8s)]
*  once you start looking, it's like, well, where's that coming from? Well, I think we need to educate [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6944.76s)]
*  people on how to how to digest social media. And, you know, I think you should treat it the same way [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6948.92s)]
*  you treat junk food. You know, and I think there's certain aspects of social media that [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6958.76s)]
*  are really interesting. And I like them. I mean, most of what I get on social media is what my [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6963.88s)]
*  friends send me. So that's how that's how I do it. And this is how I stay sane. It's like my friends [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6969.0s)]
*  send me wacky things. And I go, Oh, my God, what is this like my me my friend Christina Prusitzky, [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6975.400000000001s)]
*  she sends me like the the nuttiest, like trans activists screaming and nutty guys who think [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6979.96s)]
*  they're women. And then me and Tom Segura, we exchange murder videos, murder and car accidents [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6986.84s)]
*  and animal attacks. And then you know, before breakfast? No, I try not to in the morning, [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=6996.04s)]
*  but sometimes I have to check my text message because I have business stuff and things, [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7002.76s)]
*  things going on, you know, guests and this and that. And so I do check but, you know, it's just [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7007.24s)]
*  it's very intoxicating to just sit there on the toilet and just start scrolling toilet scroller. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7012.92s)]
*  But you got to, you know, you got to develop discipline. And discipline is important for [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7017.8s)]
*  every aspect of your life. And you just you have to know like when you've had too much. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7021.8s)]
*  But that's that's not easy for young kids. Right? It's not. But I think they can learn just like [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7025.64s)]
*  they've learned everything else in this world. But you need parental guidance. And most of the [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7030.6s)]
*  parents are hooked on it themselves. Well, I think they need a message, you know, and I think this [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7035.16s)]
*  conversation is part of that message. You know, I think kids need to realize like you are wasting [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7039.0s)]
*  time. Like if you spend two hours just scrolling through TikTok, you have wasted time. And there's [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7043.48s)]
*  stuff that you probably should be doing. And you're going to be depressed if you don't do those [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7049.0s)]
*  things. You're going to feel weird. You're not going to feel satisfied. You're not going to feel [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7052.68s)]
*  like you're on a good path. You're going to like not have a lot of respect for yourself if you just [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7056.44s)]
*  like sit on the couch all day and scroll through TikTok, which many people listening to this have [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7062.28s)]
*  done a whole day, just sitting there eating chips, scrolling through TikTok and just wasting your day. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7067.88s)]
*  That is possible to do. I think there's ways that you can incorporate it into your life where it's [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7075.0s)]
*  interesting, you know, and I've got good algorithms now, especially on YouTube, but pretty good [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7082.84s)]
*  algorithms on Instagram, too, where most of the stuff it's showing me is stuff I'm actually [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7089.4800000000005s)]
*  interested in. So you get those videos when you're interested in a topic and then there'll be like [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7093.8s)]
*  five different videos that are being suggested to you in about five minutes in you're like, [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7098.76s)]
*  this is just an AI voice that's that's cobbled a whole bunch of old things together and it's a new [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7103.0s)]
*  version of it. Oh, yeah. I'm not learning anything. Yeah, there's a lot of that. There's always those, [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7108.28s)]
*  too. I think YouTube is the best because like I'm interested in specific subjects, right? Like I'm a [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7112.92s)]
*  car nut. I love old cars in specific particular. This, by the way, lots of people love restored [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7118.76s)]
*  things. People love restored cars. We love you have I think you still have your car. Which one? [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7126.6s)]

*  it's awesome. Don't think that way. That's silly. Ever since I started flying 350 miles an hour, [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7191.16s)]
*  I don't care about how fast they go on the ground. It's not even how fast you go. It's just, [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7196.92s)]
*  but that's why I like old cars because it's not even how fast. I had a C5 though. I did have a [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7200.92s)]

*  around C7. C7 was nasty. That heads up display was cool though. It was like, Oh, C5 had a heads up [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7210.2s)]
*  display. Yeah, it had a heads up display. Look at that. That's the new one. That's the ZR1. Come on, [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7215.64s)]

*  automobile. A friend of mine, he just, because he's a real American car. He just bought a Tesla Model [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7256.28s)]
*  3 and he bought it for the autopilot. He says, I wish this came in 16 cylinder, you know, multi-turbo. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7265.24s)]
*  He says, Oh yeah. But he says the autopilot, he just loves that. He loves the autopilot. I have a S, [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7272.599999999999s)]

*  Yeah. Full self drive. It's incredible. It's incredible. I don't use it that much. I like to drive, [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7284.68s)]
*  but just the capability of the car is amazing. Yeah. The speed and the effortlessness in which [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7289.32s)]
*  it merges with traffic and just takes off. No sound. It's beautiful, man. It's beautiful. Yeah. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7294.36s)]
*  But it's different. So I like, I like old air cooled Porsches. I had a 911 a long time ago. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7301.16s)]
*  They're not fast. They're not fast. Cause you're a manual, manual, always. Yeah. With the big, [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7307.8s)]
*  the trunk clutch like, Oh, you got to push that thing in. Well, it's, they're floor mounted too. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7312.04s)]
*  They're different. They're the old Porsches are different, but it's, what they are is a physical [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7317.0s)]
*  experience. It's like a ride. It's a fun, exhilarating experience where you hear the, [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7323.88s)]
*  you hear the engine, you're shifting the gears yourself. It's exciting and engaging. And that is [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7330.360000000001s)]
*  more important to me sometimes than just speed. Like I don't need to go fast. It's not even about [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7335.48s)]
*  going fast. It's the whole, the whole, the whole experience. Yeah. You're feeling the rear end [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7340.679999999999s)]
*  break a little with your ass, you know, as it can't do that anymore. These modern cars, man, [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7345.719999999999s)]
*  doesn't work anymore. We used to put Porsche engines into VW buses back in the day. That was [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7350.04s)]
*  awesome. You could all, you can fit it in a, in a beetle too. You can fit, you can fit a Porsche [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7355.5599999999995s)]
*  engine into a bug. Oh yeah. A lot of people have done crazy beetle transformations where they've [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7361.16s)]
*  hyped up Porsche engines and put them in the back of those things. Yeah. There's a whole like modding [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7365.24s)]
*  community of beetle freaks that take beetles and they're Volkswagen, they're Volkswagen. Remember [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7370.599999999999s)]
*  how many there were in the seventies coming in from Germany? We all had to, I had a 1303. I loved my [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7376.44s)]
*  beetle. It was the best. Yeah. When I was a kid, my friend Jimmy had one. He had a, he had a beetle. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7382.12s)]
*  It was just cheap on gas. It was easy to drive. Mine was like, I, like I had to jump start it [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7386.84s)]
*  because the lock had broken. So like he jumped started every time you got in and then I'd lost [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7394.28s)]
*  my gas cap. And so I've just had a rag in there. And if I went around the highway to the right, [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7399.24s)]
*  and if my tank was too full, then gas would leak out and my front tire would start to slide off. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7406.12s)]
*  It was back in, you know, 18, you know, yeah, you know, just like, eh, gotta drive this thing was [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7411.56s)]
*  great. I love, that was a good, we weren't scrolling on TikTok, Joe Rogan. We were doing [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7417.4800000000005s)]
*  dangerous stuff. That's true. We were jumpstarting our cars. And I think we're lucky that we've seen [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7423.16s)]
*  both. We've gone through, we grew up in a time where there was no internet and you were going [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7428.360000000001s)]
*  outside to do things and people did physical activities. But then as we got older, we recognize [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7434.2s)]
*  that there's this new technology that's connecting the whole world in this weird way. And we're [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7439.72s)]
*  getting to experience it as people who know the world before that. I think we're real lucky. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7444.280000000001s)]
*  Well, you're, you're a big part of, of, of a change, certainly in young men. I mean, [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7449.0s)]
*  I've seen so many young men who follow you and follow your workout regime and follow, [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7453.0s)]
*  you know, listen to you. They listen to you about what you're saying about health, about food. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7459.4800000000005s)]
*  And that's a, that's a really, you're an important voice in that regard. You've really, really [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7464.12s)]
*  helped a lot of young men in our country and far beyond. I mean, I know you don't take compliments [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7469.16s)]
*  like this well, but you're, it's very important. Very, very important what you're doing. There's [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7473.879999999999s)]
*  a lot of young men that just feel like real disconnected to the world. Nothing seems to be [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7481.16s)]
*  anything that is interesting to them. And they're being pushed into this box where someone's trying [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7486.44s)]
*  to turn them into a fucking chihuahua. You know, like this is like the evolution of the wolf into [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7491.24s)]
*  the dog. That's what's happening with men. Like for some reason men are supposed to be neutered. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7496.36s)]
*  You know, there's in the six. So I've been ever since I, I got saved and become a believer there. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7501.24s)]
*  I've really learned about our American history and I've been blown away by how much, [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7510.92s)]
*  because there's a lot of, you know, you can talk about the sixties and when they outlawed [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7516.28s)]
*  psychedelic drugs and put it on schedule one, that was the exact same time when the Bible was [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7519.719999999999s)]
*  basically taken out of school. And it was, you know, and, and I think the church in general, [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7526.28s)]
*  you know, kind of went into itself and kind of, you know, became a thing you do over there on [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7533.08s)]
*  Sundays. Can we pause real quick? Cause I have to, you gotta pee. You gotta pee. Yeah. Let's pause. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7538.5199999999995s)]
*  We'll come back. We'll talk about Jesus. We'll be right back. Yeah. All right. We're back. Yeah. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7542.92s)]
*  Yeah. Oh man. Much better, right? Thank you. Thank you. So we were going to talk about the vaping [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7547.4s)]
*  thing. Cause you're saying that there's nothing wrong with vaping. Well, I didn't say there's [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7552.92s)]
*  nothing wrong with vaping. So what is that? Can I see it? Yeah. Can I hold it? Yeah. So this is a [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7556.76s)]
*  brick. I mean, you could hurt somebody with this. If you wanted to fuck somebody up. Well, if you [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7562.360000000001s)]
*  get a good grip. Yeah. Yeah. No, you just, yeah. It's like a brass knuckles almost like holding a [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7566.04s)]
*  roll of pennies. Yeah. This, no, you wouldn't do that. You're going to break your hand. That's all [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7571.32s)]
*  silly. That's why I carry my gun. That's probably better. That's the battery. The battery is heavy. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7575.400000000001s)]
*  So it's, so when I gave up, I've always taken a pull of this. Yeah. So it's the top button. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7582.04s)]
*  Yeah. Press it and just suck. What was the flavor of this? Tobacco ish. Tobacco ish. Yeah. It's [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7587.8s)]
*  tobacco basically. So that was a little hit. Yeah. You kind of got a big one, right? Let it warm up [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7593.08s)]
*  a little bit. Let it press the button and then there you go. It's cracking. Yeah. Yeah. Go, go, [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7603.88s)]
*  go, go, go. There you go. That's definitely different than the gas station ones. Oh, [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7608.76s)]
*  you don't want those. This is organic juice. It's got 0.3% nicotine. I wind my own coil made out of [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7618.92s)]
*  silver. The cotton is American made cotton, not from China. No, I've got into this. Yeah. What's [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7627.64s)]
*  the cotton for? So if you look at the mechanism, see? Okay. So the cotton sucks up the juice and [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7634.84s)]
*  then the coil warms up. So the cotton is like the filter? No, the cotton has the juice in it and then [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7643.400000000001s)]
*  when the coil warms up, it creates the vapor from the juice that's in it. So do you have to constantly [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7648.6s)]
*  refresh the cotton? Yeah. Yeah. So you just dunk your cotton in the juice? No, no, no. The juice [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7654.12s)]
*  is inside. It's in the tank. Yeah. It has little wires in there. So it just crawls up. So you just [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7660.2s)]
*  put new cotton in every now and again? Yeah. And wind a new coil from time to time. How long do [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7663.48s)]
*  you have to wait before you put new cotton in? It depends. I do it usually once every couple of [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7667.959999999999s)]
*  days. That doesn't give me the weird head rush that the gas station ones do. That's Chinese crap. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7672.839999999999s)]
*  That's what I like though. I like that weird head rush. Good luck to you. I like the first hit. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7677.799999999999s)]
*  That's what you like off those, the gas station vapes. It's like you're chasing a dragon. You get [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7683.48s)]
*  that first hit and you're like, first hits like, so relaxing. And then after that, you never get [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7687.72s)]
*  that again. So I really got into this. There was a store in Fredericksburg called Vaporlicious. They've [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7694.2s)]
*  retired now. They've retired. Jerry and Kathy and they're two old hippies from- Why do they make it [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7699.4800000000005s)]
*  so unwieldy? Well, you can get all kinds of different versions, but I'm a serious user. So I need [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7706.68s)]
*  this whole battery. I have a whole kit with me, man. I got a screwdriver to open this up and put [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7712.360000000001s)]
*  a new battery in. That doesn't fuck with your lungs or your health or anything like that? [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7716.92s)]
*  No, I've never felt this good. Okay. And so this is different juice. So what is the juice? Because [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7719.96s)]
*  the thing about the actual oil is the issue, right? And this is a thing like a lot of these [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7725.16s)]
*  cheap ones that you're buying off the gas station. You don't know what's in there. This is glycol, [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7730.92s)]
*  which is essentially the same stuff that's in the theatrical mist machines, only much watered down. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7735.32s)]
*  And all it does is just produce vapor. And so what is vapor? Well, it's mainly water. And of [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7742.92s)]
*  course, you're mixing it with nicotine. And nicotine, that's the piece that I've always liked [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7749.0s)]
*  about smoking. But now I don't get the tar. I don't get all other contaminants. And I also [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7755.8s)]
*  don't get high. I stopped. I kind of stopped. I used to smoke a lot of weed. I stopped. It's just, [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7761.32s)]
*  I haven't felt like doing it anymore. Like a glass of wine. But no. And so this, I do have [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7768.2s)]
*  gorilla grip on it. It's like everywhere I go, I'm like, where's my vape? Where's my vape? So I'm [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7774.76s)]
*  fully aware I'm addicted to more the motion of it. Because I would roll up, [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7779.88s)]
*  I could roll them with one hand behind my back. Am I doing it so long? So a real spliff with [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7788.679999999999s)]
*  tobacco, with weed. And then it will go out and I put it down and I come up, pick it up again. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7792.84s)]
*  At a certain point, it was like three in the morning, I'd wake up like, I think I'll go roll [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7797.88s)]
*  a joint. You know, I smoke a whole spliff, go back to bed. I mean, it got to be a little, [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7803.24s)]
*  I was smoking a lot. And without it, I'm very productive, Joe. I gotta tell you, I'm super [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7807.64s)]
*  productive. I'm doing all kinds of things. Well, nicotine is very good for productivity. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7815.08s)]
*  As is caffeine. Well, those are my two drugs, you know, caffeine and nicotine. I kind of dig it. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7819.24s)]
*  I really do. It's very good for productivity. Yeah. Is there any bad stuff? I mean, I know [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7825.88s)]
*  it constricts your blood flow in your mouth and in other parts, probably. I mean, obviously, [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7830.68s)]
*  you're putting something in your stream. So I don't know. But you like those pouches? [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7836.36s)]
*  Yeah, I do. But I wanted to see what happens if I took time off and I went out of the country for [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7841.4800000000005s)]
*  five days and didn't bring them. And I was fine. Didn't bother me at all. I was like, I was wondering [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7847.400000000001s)]
*  if I'd be like itching for one. Like, I'm OK on the plane. I can fly to Europe. I'm like, you know, [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7852.92s)]
*  I'm OK. I don't need to vape. Can you go in the bathroom and just get a quick one in there [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7857.96s)]
*  on the plane? You know, this is a very bad idea. You do not want to be caught vaping on the plane. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7862.28s)]
*  Oh, really? Yeah. Of course. Will that set off a fire alarm? I don't know. Can you blow it right [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7868.2s)]
*  into the toilet? You can do what they call zero vape, which is basically you inhale and you just [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7874.4400000000005s)]
*  hold it in until nothing comes out. Oh, wow. Yeah. Or, you know, I've done one of these like. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7881.72s)]
*  And they go under your jacket. Yeah, I know. I've seen people do that. But the movie that is that is [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7887.400000000001s)]
*  not approved behavior. So I do not condone that. You know, it's OK. I can handle not not vaping for [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7892.12s)]
*  eight hours. So what's in the gas station ones when you're getting that? Who knows what's in the oil? [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7899.4800000000005s)]
*  Who knows? Who knows? That's maybe what killed some people early on in covid. You know, it might [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7904.12s)]
*  have been bad. A lot of THC, of course, these pre-made cartridges. You just don't know what's [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7909.48s)]
*  in it. It's like, no, don't don't vape that stuff. Do not vape the pre-made things. I mean, this is fun. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7915.24s)]
*  You get to learn how to do it. It's manufacturing. You know, it's you get into I can really get into [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7923.4s)]
*  it like I got this this diameter silver wire and five, you know, you do five, five loops or six loops [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7928.599999999999s)]
*  for different impedance. Oh, yeah, there's a whole I mean, this tank, you know, this thing is like [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7936.36s)]
*  you try different. I have must have 18 different vapes that I've tried. Like, this is the one somebody [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7942.759999999999s)]
*  gave me one at one point in time. It was like it was carrying around a phone. It was like I was [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7947.719999999999s)]
*  carrying around. It was the size of your flip phone. Yeah. I know that this is ridiculous. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7951.88s)]
*  That's me, baby. That's me. I don't want to have another heavy thing in my pockets or in my fanny [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7956.04s)]
*  pack. It's like, yeah, no, this is OK. I mean, it's all right. And then this thing. But you decided [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7961.4s)]
*  that the phone was too invasive, even with the graphene OS. Yeah. Yeah. Because you could still [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7967.08s)]
*  do everything, just not being tracked. And so I used to go to bed and we go to bed at the same time. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7973.639999999999s)]
*  You know, we always watch some stupid like we're in season seven of Seinfeld right now. You know, [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7978.92s)]
*  so we'll watch a half hour of stupidity. And then we go to bed. And I used to be on my phone, [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7983.799999999999s)]
*  for half an hour scrolling stuff or whatever. And then, you know, OK, I'm tired. Yeah, because [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7991.24s)]
*  my brain has been working overtime on whatever inputs I'm giving it. And now I'm like, well, [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=7995.4800000000005s)]
*  there's nothing to scroll. So I just go to bed and I'm out in three seconds. I'm like, I sleep [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8001.32s)]
*  and I sleep all the way through and I wake up in the morning. I'm refreshed. I feel good. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8006.04s)]
*  I don't look at social media. The first hour I'm up. I mean, I do Bible readings and stuff [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8010.68s)]
*  and devotionals and my text, a buddy of mine and I'm ready, man. Then you do social media in the [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8016.04s)]
*  morning. No, almost not at all. So when you do it, you do it from a computer. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8022.36s)]
*  And when you do that, one of the questions I had about that, does that do voice to text? [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8030.28s)]
*  It can. Andrew. Oh, that's a game. However, of course, when you do that, Google is basically [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8035.08s)]
*  keeping your transcript. There's a company in Austin called Futo. Wait a minute. So if you just [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8042.280000000001s)]
*  text, it doesn't keep your transcript? Oh, I'm sure it does. But if you, I'm not sure what, [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8047.240000000001s)]
*  how much of that it does. But when you read, when you speak into it, it goes to the Google servers, [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8052.6s)]
*  the Google server, then trans transcribes it and sends it back to your phone. It's not happening [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8058.04s)]
*  on the phone. It's happening on Google servers and they probably keep all of that or my voice [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8062.52s)]
*  or whatever. There's a company in Austin called Futo, F-U-T-O, and they have an open source [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8068.04s)]
*  voice to text system that don't keep your transcripts. And they have some good guys. I've [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8074.6s)]
*  been messing with that. It's not quite as fast as Google. And will that work on that phone? [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8079.08s)]
*  Yeah. You can install it. Yeah. Just as an extra keyboard. But do you ever send messages with [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8082.5199999999995s)]
*  Google voice or with voice to text on that phone? I've been using Futo. Oh, you have? Yeah. On that [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8086.68s)]
*  phone. Yeah. Yeah. So I use it on my phone all the time. Like when I'm in my car, I pressed a [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8093.0s)]
*  little button to Apple Siri. Yeah. So I'm, you know, who knows what Apple's doing with that? [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8097.56s)]
*  You don't know. I mean, sending it right to China. All the memes. Maybe, maybe. I don't know. It's [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8102.28s)]
*  all right. It's okay. Yeah. So I went to Boston. You live in Boston, didn't you? So we went to go [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8108.04s)]
*  see the Doobie Brothers. And when was this? Last year. Really? They're around. Yes. And it was [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8113.88s)]
*  wild. It was in Massachusetts. It was one of these amphitheaters that's half covered. And [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8121.8s)]
*  we were the youngest people there. And people were sparking weed. You could smell the whole place. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8129.16s)]
*  They're like 80 year old dudes smoking Doobies. It was amazing. And the Doobie Brothers play, [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8134.68s)]
*  and it was like, what this? It was the first 45 minutes is them doing. This is from our album [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8141.0s)]
*  from five years ago. Dude, we want China Grove, you know, you know, give us long train running. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8147.72s)]
*  So eventually they get into that. But then they would like Michael McDonald, What a Fool Believes. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8152.52s)]
*  You know, I love that song. He would do it syncopically. Like what instead of doing the [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8156.52s)]
*  song, like we all remember it, you do what a fool believe he's like, no, no, don't do that. It was [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8160.92s)]
*  really disappointing. But the opening act was Steve Winwood. Steve Winwood is now almost 80 years old. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8167.96s)]
*  And I get goosebumps just thinking about it. He railed, he wailed. He did, you know, Mr. Fantasy [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8175.72s)]
*  from traffic, which that three quarters of that song is guitar solo. And he's just like, [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8183.0s)]
*  bam, and then and then and go and the crowd is going nuts. And he has all these young kids with [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8190.36s)]
*  them. And you see the close up on the screens. And they're like, dude, look at look at what he's [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8195.64s)]
*  doing. It was amazing. I bring it up because the next day, did you go out to Plymouth? [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8201.0s)]
*  Steve McLaughlin Did I go to Plymouth? Massachusetts? Sure. Plymouth Rock? [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8206.44s)]
*  Michael McDonald Right. So Plymouth Rock is kind of disappointing because it's like it's a rock. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8209.56s)]
*  It's just a rock. And there's a structure around it. And like, okay, you know, it's a rock. And [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8217.32s)]
*  there's a little sign next to it that says, we don't know that this was really the rock. But some [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8222.44s)]
*  guy in church who was 90 years old at the time said, Yeah, I think this was the rock. So that's [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8227.4s)]
*  the rock. You were talking about the Georgia Guidestones a few episodes ago with somebody. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8231.88s)]
*  Did you know that we have an actual guide stone in America in Plymouth? [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8237.56s)]
*  Steve McLaughlin No. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8241.32s)]
*  Michael McDonald It's called the monument to the forefathers. I'd never heard of this. It's about [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8242.039999999999s)]
*  two blocks in. And it's, I think arguably the largest granite structure in the in America, [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8246.84s)]
*  certainly, but maybe in the world. It was completed in 1890. And it is the guide stone of America. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8253.32s)]
*  And if you don't know about this, no one knows about this is here. Check it out. It thing is [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8260.76s)]
*  huge. Whoa. And it's literally in a cul de sac a residential area. Really? There's no road is that [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8265.8s)]
*  it was completed in 1890 after 50 years of building it. And so this is the formula for America. This [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8272.84s)]
*  is why I was going before our pee break the formula for America this so they constructed this so that [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8281.24s)]
*  if we ever lost our way, we could find our way back. You know, when they talk about America was [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8286.84s)]
*  built on Christian values, like, what does that mean? What does that even mean Christian values? [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8291.96s)]
*  I mean, even the word Christian is like, that was actually a slur back in the day that they came up [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8296.28s)]
*  with for Jesus believers. So in the middle is faith, that's her name, faith, and it's four sides. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8301.72s)]
*  And one is law, education, morality, and liberty, and has all these cool inscriptions. It's really [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8307.72s)]
*  something amazing to see. And I believe that's the formula that we need to get back. You actually, [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8315.48s)]
*  you live like this. You're Joe Rogan lives these four sides. You live, you understand law, morality, [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8321.0s)]
*  education, and liberty. And if we can get back to that, you know, that would be just an in fact, [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8328.039999999999s)]
*  so all of our early presidents, all of them live by the Bible, every single one of them. They [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8335.88s)]
*  they wrote about it. They studied it. 1778, the first act, one of the first acts of a congress was [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8342.84s)]
*  to print a Bible for everybody. So I brought you, this is done by a group called the Wall Builders. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8349.64s)]
*  And David Barton, he has all this. These are the receipts. So that's it's a Bible, but it has [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8357.32s)]
*  three quarters of that book is writings by our early presidents all the way up through [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8363.24s)]
*  Reagan. And this David Barton guy, he has all of these originals. I think he lives in Aledo, Texas. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8369.960000000001s)]
*  And it shows you what our code was in the early days up until the 60s. And that's when, [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8376.76s)]
*  you know, we've got this big argument about, well, we can't have, you know, the whole, [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8384.28s)]
*  the First Amendment is the right to establish a religion. And that has been perverted throughout [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8389.32s)]
*  the years to say, well, you can't have, you know, the Bible in schools and the government can't tell [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8395.56s)]
*  you to do this. And you can't be talking about they used to the Hall of Congress used to be a [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8400.84s)]
*  church. I mean, that that's how we started. And you don't have to necessarily be a believer or [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8405.64s)]
*  saved by Jesus just to understand where we came from. And the basic tenets of law, where those [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8411.32s)]
*  guys created it from, you know, the receipts are in the Declaration of Independence, our [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8418.84s)]
*  Bill of Rights, our amendments, our rights, not that the government gives us, you know, [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8424.28s)]
*  they all say the government shall not infringe the government may not do this. It's what the [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8429.48s)]
*  government could not do because we had rights given to us by our creator. And I think if we [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8433.8s)]
*  got back to a little bit of that in America, we might get a bit more on path, which is why [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8440.2s)]
*  certainly all the all the Jesus freaks are like, President Trump is talking about God. He says God [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8446.039999999999s)]
*  saved him to to save America. I mean, this is a president is a big deal when he does stuff like [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8452.279999999999s)]
*  that. And you can see just look at the people around us. Russell Brand, Tucker Carlson, [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8457.96s)]
*  Candace Owens. I mean, there's a lot of people who are now starting to see this. And I know you love [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8463.4s)]
*  history. That's why I bought that for you. Because when you see where it comes from, a lot of things [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8468.92s)]
*  start to be clear. And that that sculpture that was like, I had no idea it was there. I'd never [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8474.84s)]
*  heard of it. It's not in any books. But it's kind of a template for where we came from. And I think [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8480.6s)]
*  it's it's kind of important that we look at that as well as you know, all the other things that [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8486.52s)]
*  we're looking at now with AI and social media. And we can't just be sitting around for four years [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8491.16s)]
*  going, Yeah, Trump, yeah, Elon, stomp the libs, we've got to find some spirituality one way the [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8498.04s)]
*  other. It doesn't have to be God. I would like it to be but people got to find that. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8503.64s)]
*  I think you're saying some wise things. I think that people need some sort of a moral and ethical [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8508.439999999999s)]
*  structure to live their life through. Jordan Peterson always has this thing like another one, [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8514.84s)]
*  whether or not if you believe in God, if you live like you believe in God, you follow about you will [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8519.0s)]
*  live a better life. And that is true. I believe it. I believe it. Absolutely. And it's very simple [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8523.88s)]
*  scaffolding. Yeah, it's very simple things. You know, it's the Ten Commandments aren't that hard, [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8531.8s)]
*  you know, it's like, that's your that's your law. If you believe that government, I mean, [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8537.0s)]
*  government is an extension of God if you believe that he instates governments and I think that [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8542.359999999999s)]
*  I think that God gave us Joe Biden for four years. I really do. He said, y'all got to take a look. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8549.72s)]
*  He has humor, too, by the way, like, you got you should take a look. And there's a story. I think [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8556.44s)]
*  it's Daniel about King Nebuchadnezzar and King Nebuchadnezzar. He did not follow God's law. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8562.68s)]
*  And so God turned him into a donkey, basically, and he was out grazing for seven years eating grass. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8569.880000000001s)]
*  I'm like, that sounds a lot like President Biden, that he just turned him into a grass eating [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8575.24s)]
*  donkey who had nothing left, you know. So this. Well, you have to see what happens when things go [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8580.92s)]
*  sideways to really understand it. That's why people who grow up in poverty really can appreciate [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8587.4s)]
*  success a lot more than someone is a trust fund kid. Right. Of course, you have to know what it's [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8594.12s)]
*  like when things go bad. And our country just experienced four years of being governed by [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8598.52s)]
*  people other than the elected leader. And it's pretty clear now. Yeah. And you know, the way [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8603.960000000001s)]
*  Mike Johnson laid it out that Biden didn't know what was in some of the executive. I didn't sign [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8609.08s)]
*  that. Yeah. Oh, no. It's crazy. Crazy. I mean, it's interesting because some of that, like how much [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8614.44s)]
*  can you attribute it to faulty memory and how much of it is actually they passed things by his desk? [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8619.32s)]
*  I don't know. But at the end of the day, we got to see that this was not a good direction. This is a [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8625.0s)]
*  terrible direction. And I think that was like one of the biggest mistakes that Kamala Harris did [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8630.68s)]
*  was when she went on The View and they asked her, what would you do differently? And she said nothing. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8634.28s)]
*  Yeah. Which is crazy. But also look at President Trump. I mean, can you take a more wrong guy [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8637.8s)]
*  in the auspices and the opinion of presidential and everything? And he learned a lot during his [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8645.64s)]
*  first term. I mean, this was a turnaround of epic proportion, epic proportion that and I know a lot [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8652.279999999999s)]
*  of this political comeback is in the history of the world. It'll be in the history books. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8659.72s)]
*  The show will be a part of that. It's going to be incredibly important for us to look back on this [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8665.08s)]
*  because, you know, like it's often the misfits. You know, that's who we've got to love the most. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8670.84s)]
*  So when I see the blue haired people, I'm like, right, I really want to love them. Yeah, they [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8677.08s)]
*  probably wouldn't understand it, but crazy, chaotic energy. If they just found something they loved [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8681.320000000002s)]
*  and pushed it into that, they'd be better off. But it's also it's like what damaged them up into [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8686.28s)]
*  that point? Like what kind of a life did they live that left them in this place where they're 35 [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8691.32s)]
*  years old weeping in front of a city council meeting? Like who are they and what went wrong? [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8696.039999999999s)]
*  And this is the thing is like we kind of encourage this victim mentality. We do. And we reward it. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8701.72s)]
*  It has social credit to it. And you, you know, you get to be in a special class of people and [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8707.24s)]
*  you get to say outrageous things and people allow you to. And that's not good for anybody. Just like [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8713.72s)]
*  you have kids. You know what it's like. It's not good for kids. Like you got to tell them like, [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8718.92s)]
*  well, that's not real. You can't do that. That's not yours. Like there's things that you have to [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8723.4s)]
*  learn. And if you reward victim mentality, then people look to become victims. And so that like [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8729.48s)]
*  when that lady laid out all of her fucking physical ailments and all of her problems, [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8735.64s)]
*  as if that makes any of the things she's saying makes sense because she has all these problems, [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8740.6s)]
*  like, no, that's not, that's not how the world works. But you're right. It's been rewarded. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8745.64s)]
*  Rewarded. And it's been rewarded by political operations, mainly to get votes and to bring. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8749.64s)]
*  These people have a vote too. You know, they can vote. So bring them in. This is a part of the [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8755.8s)]
*  PSYOP of USAID. And the PSYOP of just the government in general, these control structures [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8760.279999999999s)]
*  that are essentially put in place to make sure that they remain in power. You know, John Perkins? [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8767.4s)]
*  Yes. Have you ever had him on? No, I have not. Oh man. Cause he wrote about this, you know, [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8772.76s)]
*  economic hitman. Yeah. Confession of economic hitman. Wow. I mean, basically USAID, that's what [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8776.84s)]
*  they do, but also state department. So, you know, Marco Rubio seems like a good guy. I'm kind of [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8783.24s)]
*  liking him, but they've got intelligence units inside there. There's all kinds of things that [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8788.52s)]
*  happen with state department. So I hope that also gets uncovered. Well, Mike Benz was explaining [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8793.4s)]
*  yesterday. I was like, this is seems so intertwined. Like how are you going to, [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8798.92s)]
*  what can be done in four years? He goes, no, this is going to take 50 years more. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8803.56s)]
*  Maybe true. It's going to take forever to unwind. Because you have to understand how deep these [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8808.6s)]
*  tentacles go. And he laid it out in four and a half hours yesterday. I probably talked for three [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8812.12s)]
*  minutes for the whole podcast. I'm not kidding. With Mike, you got to like, can I get the transcript [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8818.36s)]
*  of this show and go over it slowly? Cause he goes fast, man. He goes fast. The thing that will happen [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8823.32s)]
*  is viral clips of specific things that he highlights and says that are very significant [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8828.6s)]
*  are going to go out. Those are already out and I'm sure they're all over X right now as we're [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8833.32s)]
*  speaking. And I love that Doge is, I was skeptical because, you know, we heard this during the Reagan [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8838.44s)]
*  administration. Reagan wasn't going to do all this. He was going to make government efficient. And of [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8845.08s)]
*  course it didn't. When I hear that they're going to do the same thing to the military, amen, man. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8848.28s)]
*  Well, they have to be accountable to an audit. Yes. You can't. They haven't done one ever. Well, [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8854.36s)]
*  the Pentagon's failed seven of them. And the thing is like fraud's real. We know it's real and we [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8859.560000000001s)]
*  know people are pilfering. And if you go unchecked for long enough, that becomes a part of the way [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8865.640000000001s)]
*  people do business. And once that's established and it's been established for decades, then it's [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8871.0s)]
*  very difficult to stop because as soon as you start investigating it, people go to jail. And so they're [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8876.52s)]
*  going to try to stop you from investigating it. They're going to try to like bury records and [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8881.24s)]
*  it's going to get wild. As I'm sure Mike told you, and I can't wait to see it, it's not just fraud. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8886.76s)]
*  It is the actual system. Instead of us being open and I think like Trump is doing like, hey, [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8892.199999999999s)]
*  we're just going to have tariffs on you. NATO, you don't like it. Boom, we're not going to protect you. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8898.76s)]
*  You know, we got to be fair about this. You can't just be ripping us off. We've been doing all these [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8904.199999999999s)]
*  subversive things with money that's just going to NGOs and nonprofits. I mean, the whole Ukraine [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8909.08s)]
*  thing. He highlighted all of this. Did he play the Victoria Newland recorded phone call? No, [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8915.72s)]
*  he didn't. But he showed the Biden thing where he said, you know, the prosecutor had to be fired or [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8921.72s)]
*  they wouldn't get the billion dollars in loans. Right, right. And son of a bitch. Well, Victoria [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8926.92s)]
*  Newland in 2014, the Russians, I think they released it, they recorded a phone call and she's [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8931.8s)]
*  literally talking to the ambassador. Okay, we want to put this guy in the government, that guy in [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8937.72s)]
*  the government, this guy in Senate, Clitch, leave him outside. He can be the mayor or whatever. I mean, [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8942.039999999999s)]
*  that's not cool. We have some stuff to repent for when all this comes out and we should pick ourselves [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8947.4s)]
*  up and move forward and just be honest. I think we can do it with a lot of honesty too. I hope so. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8953.72s)]
*  But the problem is there's a lot of people that are going to be in deep trouble and they're going [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8960.76s)]
*  to try to stop that from all this accountability. Was Mike bullish or bearish on it? Well, he's, [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8964.6s)]
*  you know, he's in the storm, you know, it's like, you know, no one knows exactly what's going to [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8970.36s)]
*  happen when you're in the middle of the hurricane, you're telling people what's going on and that's [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=8974.52s)]

*  Winds of Change. The Winds of Change. You don't remember the song. And it was the only song they [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9382.2s)]

*  The CIA wrote a banger. A huge banger. A huge, and the cra, here's the funniest part. So when [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9433.32s)]
*  the wall comes down, this is number one. It was 1990. And I think, I can't remember, I think they [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9439.8s)]
*  might have been phonetically singing along with it in Lenin Stadium when we were there, because it [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9446.599999999999s)]
*  was a number one hit. It was everywhere, this song. So this is a year before the wall came down? It says [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9451.0s)]
*  this song was written after the concert. Like in response to the concert. Okay. Yeah. Okay. I told [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9455.16s)]
*  you I don't have it all right. But the CIA wrote it. The CIA wrote it. They probably had it in the [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9461.16s)]
*  archives. Oh my God. The funniest thing was, so huge in Europe at the time was Baywatch. You know, [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9467.0s)]
*  you know the whole, have you ever had Hasselhoff on? No. There's a funny guy. This guy, he's- He was on [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9473.24s)]

*  whatever. MTV Beach House, like his manager would be like, David, I think you need to go to the [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9487.16s)]
*  bathroom to get some energy. Oh yeah. Anyway, but so, you know, the story of Baywatch is phenomenal [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9491.32s)]
*  because he self-financed it. Nobody wanted it in America. And it became this monstrous global hit [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9500.36s)]
*  everywhere except America in the beginning. And you know, he became wildly successful, rich. [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9506.6s)]
*  And Germany is where it was number one. It was just for years, number one Baywatch. And so [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9512.68s)]
*  Hasselhoff, or as they say, Dear Hof, hello Deutschland, here's the Hof. Everyone knew him. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9518.04s)]
*  He was standing on top of the wall with a sledgehammer and he claims that he brought down [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9523.800000000001s)]
*  the Berlin Wall. Was Baywatch a Psyop? Is that what you got in that? I don't know. Oh my God. Well, [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9529.080000000002s)]
*  this is also part of the thing that Mike Benz got into with the music business, that they do sort of [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9537.720000000001s)]
*  finance these disruptive kind of songs and political movements. Sure. Wow. Of course. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9543.72s)]
*  Of course. I mean, yeah. Yeah. It's a powerful tool. That's that book about Laurel Keaton. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9551.72s)]
*  There he is. Look at him. He's bringing down the wall. What is he singing? [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9558.44s)]
*  Oh, he was a pop star, right? He had these disco hits. He had these poppy hits. Yeah. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9564.92s)]

*  American icon, ladies and gentlemen. That's not even glittery. That's an LED jacket. Like that [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9574.44s)]
*  jacket's got a battery. Oh yeah. Of course, we loved him from Knight Rider. He was a cool dude. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9578.76s)]
*  We all wanted a kit watch, which we now have, of course. He was huge overseas, right? That's it. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9584.84s)]
*  It was because of Baywatch and he had a whole music career going on. Oh yeah. Oh man. Good times in [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9591.0s)]

*  song was written by the CIA. That Laurel Canyon thing is really interesting because I really [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9603.64s)]
*  dismissed it at first. I was like, come on. The government didn't have nothing to do with [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9609.24s)]
*  the rock and roll movement, but kind of seems like they did. What is it? Strange [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9614.439999999999s)]
*  Times in the Canyon. What is that book called again? I feel that's the name. Is that it? Yeah. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9620.439999999999s)]

*  what the fuck? How much of this is ... In the 60s, when the agents were infiltrating [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9629.8s)]

*  art especially. That was really at the time to make sure that- Weird scenes inside the canyon. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9640.76s)]
*  To make sure that the Russians didn't take over Europe. There's all these things that they were [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9646.04s)]
*  doing. Well, they also did it with the modern art movement. Absolutely. Like Jackson Pollock is a [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9650.84s)]
*  complete creation, which totally makes sense because I was like, who's paying for this? [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9655.880000000001s)]
*  Help me out. No, don't you see the way the splatters are? No, I don't. That's why we're [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9661.0s)]
*  all questioning you, Joe Rogan. What USAID connections do you have? I think I skipped [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9665.8s)]
*  the system. I think somehow or another they fucked up and let me through. Look at me. My whole family's [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9670.84s)]
*  intelligence and military. I was a pirate radio guy in 1983. They must've been like, this guy's [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9675.72s)]
*  lost. We can't use him. He'll be no good. The real kooky people probably think you're my handler [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9681.24s)]
*  or something because you created podcasts. That's right. Because there is that thought that this is [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9686.039999999999s)]
*  one of the things that comes up now all the time. We talked about this on CNN. We're saying that [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9691.24s)]
*  there's a whole finance-backed right-wing ecosystem that's created these podcasts. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9695.24s)]
*  Where's my check? This is just stupidity. This is the problem where when you look at some [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9701.4s)]
*  conspiracies, you think, oh, well, that applies to all things. No, there's actually some things that [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9707.4s)]
*  are organic for some weird reason. What I think we'll see, the first thing after the election is, [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9712.199999999999s)]
*  we needed Joe Rogan on the left. We needed Joe Rogan. Well, guys, you basically had a Joe Rogan [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9718.039999999999s)]
*  on the left, but you were so crazy that Joe started to think right. They didn't want me. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9723.48s)]
*  That was the thing. They didn't want you? That's all the psy-op working against them because in [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9728.199999999999s)]
*  the past, they could take someone like me and demonize them and it would be effective. They [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9733.16s)]
*  could just remove you from the airwaves and then remove you as a problem because you're not playing [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9737.96s)]
*  by the rules. Now, people go, oh, you know what? I think he's the one who's actually telling the [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9743.08s)]
*  truth. Let's stop listening to them. Then CNN crashes and then Faith in Mainstream Media crashes [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9747.48s)]
*  and Faith in Podcasts rises. I think what we'll see though is, and it may come from YouTube, [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9753.4s)]
*  we'll probably see them try to hype someone up to become the Joe Rogan of the left. [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9758.44s)]
*  Oh, they're already definitely doing that. Who do you think it is? I don't care. Let them try. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9764.44s)]
*  But the thing is, it's not going to work unless that person's authentic. Without authenticity, [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9769.56s)]
*  doesn't work. If you hear a person long enough, you know what the fuck they're really saying. You [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9773.88s)]
*  know whether or not, you know, I'm wrong all the time. You might not agree with me. That's all [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9779.32s)]
*  great, but I'm not going to lie. That's the difference. A lot of these people are just [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9784.199999999999s)]
*  propagandists and they're also trying to make an argument for something without looking at the other [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9789.24s)]
*  side, which instantaneously, I know now you're propagandizing. Now you're bullshitting me. [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9796.6s)]
*  I always try to look at the other side of everything. I know you do. As a human, I think [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9802.279999999999s)]
*  it's an important quality. As a person who's broadcasting to millions of people, [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9807.96s)]
*  it's a very important quality. But it's an important quality for human beings. Know why [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9812.039999999999s)]
*  you think about something. Is this just a knee-jerk reaction or is this well thought out? [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9816.359999999999s)]
*  Are you being objective or are you captured by this ideology that you're a part of to the point [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9821.96s)]
*  where you're just ignoring? This is the thing that I find fascinating about all this USA stuff [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9828.279999999999s)]
*  because there's so many people that are so against Donald Trump dismantling the organization [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9834.119999999999s)]
*  that they're not looking at the craziness of all the propaganda that's being exposed. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9839.32s)]
*  They somehow are another gaslighting themselves and all their followers to say that, no, [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9844.119999999999s)]
*  this is aid. People are going to starve to death. There's food that's rotting. Meanwhile, [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9848.68s)]
*  I think I'm pretty sure even when they passed this thing where they were trying to put a stop on USAID, [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9853.48s)]
*  they gave exemptions for food and medicine. You're hearing these bullshit stories of food [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9860.36s)]
*  that's rotting now and people are going to go starving and everyone's dying of aids. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9867.560000000001s)]
*  You have figures who people see as authority because they have a million followers and likes [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9872.04s)]
*  and then they'll believe that. It typically doesn't work. I think it works, but it works [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9876.52s)]
*  for less people. There's people that want to be lied to. They want to believe the cult. They want [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9882.84s)]
*  to drink the Kool-Aid. They want to. That is where they've dug their heels in and now this [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9888.36s)]
*  is where they stay. When you see Rachel Maddow, who has come back for the first 100 days, [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9893.880000000001s)]
*  she's doing a show every single day and she's blatantly lying. Literally, factually, clearly [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9899.24s)]
*  lying. A lot of people won't watch anything. They've been told Joe Rogan is part of the [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9905.640000000001s)]
*  broadcasting and this right-wing conspiracy all funded by whatever to propagandize and people [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9911.88s)]
*  are going to go over there and they're going to believe what she says. I have family members who [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9919.88s)]
*  truly believe that President Trump will take away their social security. He's saying quite the [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9925.48s)]
*  opposite. By the way, he can't take it away. Only Congress can take it away. USAID, created by [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9930.199999999999s)]
*  executive order by President Kennedy, can be shut by executive order by President Trump. That's just [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9936.119999999999s)]
*  a fact. Also, what they're doing is they're highlighting there's people that are supposedly [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9941.24s)]
*  150 years old that are getting social security. Awesome. I need some of that. There's some weird [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9945.08s)]
*  shit going on with social security. But you know what happened? I think this is what we're not [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9950.119999999999s)]
*  being told, but I have a lot of sysadmin friends. From what I understand, the Doge team, four guys [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9954.68s)]
*  initially, they were in ... So the treasury is like our bank account. It's one system and it [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9960.68s)]
*  sends payments through the Federal Reserve system. All they needed to do, January 21st at midnight, [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9966.76s)]
*  they were in there. They got all the payments. They've had that at Mar-a-Lago. They've been ... [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9972.76s)]
*  Because I've heard this, that they've been going through it like, hey, there's no reconciliation. [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9979.0s)]
*  There's just a payment with no purchase order or no confirmation that the work was done. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9982.6s)]
*  I think at this point, they're just sitting back going, they can release more information [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9988.6s)]
*  whenever they want. Department of Education is going to be next. You're going to see a lot of [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9994.04s)]
*  Common Core craziness. Remember that Common Core? The Pentagon, I hope they do the State Department [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=9997.880000000001s)]
*  too because there's a lot going on there. It's going to be interesting to see what resistance ... [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10005.480000000001s)]
*  Well, the people who are squealing are the ones you want to pay attention to. [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10010.68s)]
*  Well, that's the thing is that, first of all, we were talking about this the other day. [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10013.640000000001s)]
*  Me and my friends are saying part of the problem is these people can't conspire right now because [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10018.44s)]
*  all their phones are tapped. Everybody that ... For sure. If they're investigating you, [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10023.16s)]
*  if they're investigating these things, the power that they have- [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10029.48s)]
*  Is astronomical. [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10033.0s)]
*  It's crazy. The power that they have to look into people's emails, look into people's phones, [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10033.96s)]
*  find out what text messages they're sending. They can look into your signal. [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10037.96s)]
*  Pegasus, baby. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10040.92s)]
*  Yeah. They look into everything. The idea that they're not doing that if they're in the middle [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10042.36s)]
*  of some fucking multi-trillion dollar investigation into rampant fraud, so they know that this is [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10046.76s)]
*  going on. They can't conspire. Then they also have to worry about people taking deals. [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10052.68s)]
*  There's going to be some people that squeal. [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10056.92s)]
*  Good point. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10058.44s)]
*  So then you don't know who's your fucking enemy and who's your friend. Everywhere you talk, [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10058.92s)]
*  you go to have a lunch with someone, he's wearing a fucking button camera. You could be fucked. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10063.32s)]
*  So they're not united right now. This is why it's working. This is why they're able to [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10067.800000000001s)]
*  release all this information and everybody's in this hot panic right now. [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10074.6s)]
*  Yeah. They're squeezing them. They're squeezing them because they have it all. [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10077.880000000001s)]
*  Thank God for James O'Keefe too, man. He's done some interesting stuff over the years. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10081.64s)]
*  He certainly has. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10085.8s)]
*  Over the years. He gets people to ... It's amazing how many guys will open up when they [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10086.36s)]
*  think they're on a date with a hot chick or a hot guy, whichever one that happens to be, [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10092.76s)]
*  and like, oh yeah, man, I'm doing all this. Yeah, we don't care. We just hated Trump. [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10097.64s)]
*  Whoa. These people, they need to learn how to shut up. [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10103.56s)]
*  I think he just got another video that he released today. [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10107.8s)]
*  Oh yeah? [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10110.28s)]
*  There was another video today about people going around the Doge system to try to still [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10110.68s)]
*  do the same work. [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10117.48s)]
*  Pro. [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10118.2s)]
*  There was an issue with ... [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10119.800000000001s)]
*  Season of reveal, Joe. [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10120.68s)]
*  Yeah. Wasn't there an issue with FEMA releasing ... Is this true? [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10122.12s)]
*  Well, so FEMA paid $59 million for illegal entrance into our country for them to stay [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10125.720000000001s)]
*  at the Roosevelt Hotel, which is double the room rate. Have you ever stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel? [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10134.6s)]
*  I did way back in the day. The Roosevelt Hotel, by the way, is owned by Pakistan. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10140.68s)]
*  Yes, right. It was a dump. Everyone was smoking weed in their rooms. I mean, I was there maybe [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10144.68s)]
*  10 years ago, 11 years ago I stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel. [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10150.92s)]
*  It was falling apart a little bit. [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10154.04s)]
*  It was very cheap, right there on 42nd Street. They were paying double the room rate, but this [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10155.64s)]
*  isn't just in the United States. This has been happening all over the world. This is a gigantic [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10162.84s)]
*  scam. [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10169.24s)]
*  Four federal employees were fired Tuesday over payments to reimburse New York City for hotel [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10169.88s)]
*  costs for migrants. Department of Homeland Security officials said the workers were accused [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10174.359999999999s)]
*  of circumventing leadership to make the transactions, which have been standard for [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10178.279999999999s)]
*  years through a program that helps with costs to care for a surge in migration. However, [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10182.279999999999s)]
*  officials did not give details on how the four had violated any policies, [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10187.56s)]
*  but they put a freeze on the payments. [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10193.88s)]
*  Oh, he said luxury hotels. That's kind of funny. [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10196.599999999999s)]
*  Quotes. Did they definitely do it? Wasn't Anderson Cooper disputing it? He was saying yesterday, [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10199.0s)]
*  yeah, he was talking to Sununo and he called him a dick. [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10209.720000000001s)]
*  But this is, go to Chicago, all the hotels on the Miracle Mile are all migrant hotels, [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10212.12s)]
*  because it was super good money. I mean, but that's everywhere in the world. That's the same in [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10218.76s)]
*  Europe. A big hotel change. You can't get a hotel room because they've got migrants [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10223.88s)]
*  for double the price. Well, this is also something that the Biden administration lied about because [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10228.679999999998s)]
*  they said the FEMA funds were not being used. That's what they were. [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10232.679999999998s)]
*  I'm with President Trump that it's better. When Helene happened, what happened there was [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10236.519999999999s)]
*  really beautiful because everything fell down. Even North Carolina's, their own state government, [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10243.48s)]
*  no one really was doing anything. It was funny enough for the first time I've ever seen ham [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10253.32s)]
*  operators actually be successful. But the helicopter guys were all going out there. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10257.8s)]
*  Everybody was pitching in. People were driving from all different states to come in and help [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10263.72s)]
*  people. I don't have a helicopter anymore, but I literally called up the airfield. I said, [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10268.279999999999s)]
*  fill them up. Here's my credit card. Fill that one. Just fill them up. Fill up until [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10273.48s)]
*  this limit that I have. Fill up these. I know what it costs. You burn a lot of money in it. [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10278.279999999999s)]
*  I don't have a helicopter. This is how America works. It really works well when we help each [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10283.32s)]
*  other out in all kinds of circumstances. We've become so reliant on the government, [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10291.16s)]
*  so reliant that Uncle Sam is going to come in and save us. It turns out they're not really [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10297.24s)]
*  efficient at it. They're not really good at it. A lot of money gets stuck and flows to other places. [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10302.76s)]
*  We've got to come back to loving our neighbor and knowing your neighbor. How many people don't [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10307.96s)]
*  know their neighbor anymore? This is critical. When Clinton was president, [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10313.08s)]
*  everything changed in America. All of a sudden, oh, that's not sexual relations. Oh, you can do [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10322.28s)]
*  that to me, baby. That's not actually sex. All these kinds of things. That sets a tone. It sets [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10328.12s)]
*  a cultural tone. Trump is setting a cultural tone of, let's get this done. Let's stop getting [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10334.2s)]
*  ripped off by other people by ourselves and let's be successful together. It's a short [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10341.96s)]
*  amount of time. I hope that- Isn't it interesting that half the country doesn't see it that way? [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10348.919999999998s)]
*  Half the country sees it as a constitutional crisis. [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10354.919999999998s)]
*  Well, that's just a term. It's not a constitutional- I know, but it's interesting. [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10358.439999999999s)]
*  Top FEMA official is fired over payments. New York City Migrant Shelter's Trump administration [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10362.759999999998s)]
*  fired the Federal Emergency Management Agency's chief financial officer and three others after [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10367.16s)]
*  Elon Musk misleadingly claimed the agency had used disaster relief funds for migrant services. [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10371.96s)]
*  Wait a minute, is this New York Times? This is just going to be back and forth, [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10376.92s)]
*  back and forth forever. Misleading. What is misleading about it? [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10379.64s)]
*  Yeah, whatever. So let's see here. New York City officials raced to clarify that the federal money [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10382.76s)]
*  had been properly allocated by FEMA under President Biden last year, adding that it was not a disaster [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10386.84s)]
*  relief grant and had not been spent on luxury hotels. Nonetheless, just two hours after Mr. [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10393.16s)]
*  Musk's post, FEMA's acting director, Cameron Hamilton, announced the payments in question [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10398.76s)]
*  have all been suspended, even though most of the money had already been dispersed and that personnel [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10402.6s)]
*  will be held accountable. But is this a recent payment and did they put a freeze on payments, [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10407.24s)]
*  even if the payment had been properly allocated by Biden? [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10412.36s)]
*  What I was reading is they just pulled the money out of bank accounts. [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10416.68s)]
*  Who did? It says Trump administration. Trump revokes [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10420.599999999999s)]
*  $80 million from New York City after threat. I'm seeing this on multiple websites, but I don't know. [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10424.039999999999s)]
*  See, can you go to the title there on Daily News? Oh, hold on, sorry. [[02:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10428.119999999999s)]
*  You just had it there. That's right here too. [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10434.039999999999s)]
*  Oh, Trump revokes $80 million from New York City after threat to clawback FEMA cash used to care [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10435.56s)]
*  for migrants. But it's still money to care for migrants and they still put a freeze on that money [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10441.72s)]
*  to care for migrants. That's your constitutional crisis. [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10447.48s)]
*  We're in a constitutional crisis because of what's happened to our country. [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10450.84s)]
*  But that seems like gaslighting to justify spending $80 million to pay for migrants, [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10454.52s)]
*  which they shouldn't have done. No. [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10461.64s)]
*  But it's not just that. It's fly these people there, fly them into the country, [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10463.8s)]
*  let them into the country, and then pay for them with EBT cards, with debit cards. [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10468.76s)]
*  A lot of that was the economics. I have a friend, former New York banker, and he said, [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10473.64s)]
*  we always win as long as our population is growing. We will beat China long term because [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10479.64s)]
*  their population is declining. And he says, that's why the borders are open. It's just like economics. [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10483.96s)]
*  You need more people and with more people, your economy grows one way or the other. [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10491.08s)]
*  I think it's a multifaceted argument because I think that's- [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10495.8s)]
*  I'm just telling you what the bankers say. I think there's some truth to that, but I think also [[02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10498.039999999999s)]
*  they were trying to buy votes. Yeah. I mean, all of that's a part of it. [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10502.68s)]
*  Well, you saw the thing in New York where they were trying to let people who were illegals [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10506.44s)]
*  vote in regional elections. Yes. [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10510.36s)]
*  Yeah. That's your constitutional crisis. That is a constitutional crisis. [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10512.68s)]
*  Here's the thing that I hope, and I'm working to make this happen. So we have great podcasts, [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10516.76s)]
*  your podcast. Not everybody can be a Joe Rogan and we can't just all be looking at national news. [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10523.64s)]
*  What has happened at a local level is radio stations, they all got bought up, they're all [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10531.08s)]
*  consolidated. No one has local programming anymore. There's almost no local newspapers, [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10537.480000000001s)]
*  even local television stations. They're all going away. Now is the time to create a podcast for [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10545.0s)]
*  your town, your burgh, your city, your community. Wasn't Gavin Newsom doing that right after the [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10551.08s)]
*  election? Didn't he start a podcast? Well, I don't know about Gavin Newsom. [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10558.2s)]
*  I think he did. I think that was their idea to try to combat the podcast like this. [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10563.240000000002s)]
*  We don't need that. We need local voices. All the advertising locally has been slurped up by [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10569.08s)]
*  Facebook. That's where you advertise. I've started a local thing in Fredericksburg, [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10577.0s)]
*  and people really love it. Oh, wait a minute, there's something going on in Fredericksburg? [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10584.92s)]
*  All they have is Fredericksburg rants and raves on a Facebook page. Well, [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10589.56s)]
*  you imagine what a mess that thing is. That's crazy. That's no good. Rants and rave now, [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10593.0s)]
*  that's no good. And so I started a thing called Godcaster.fm, and it's tailored towards helping [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10598.28s)]
*  radio stations do this, but I think churches are content factories, and they're not just all [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10607.08s)]
*  talking about Jesus and God. They're doing stuff in the community. That's what churches used to do, [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10612.68s)]
*  and they're doing stuff at the high schools, and you've got kids in there. I want a thousand podcasts [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10618.36s)]
*  within a year all over America of local people, and it's so easy to do now. It's become so possible. [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10623.880000000001s)]
*  And I think that local communities will even sponsor it. That's my phase too. That's the next [[02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10630.76s)]
*  level we have to get to, is where people just get a microphone, talk to your city council person. [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10636.04s)]
*  This is nuts. All it is is national news presented by heads on television, and who needs that nonsense? [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10643.480000000001s)]
*  You're an exception, and you're really important, but we need to have this at a local level, and [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10650.76s)]
*  it's never been a better. You want to start a podcast and be able to actually make a living out [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10656.52s)]
*  of it in your local community, I guarantee people will support it. I guarantee people will want to [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10660.84s)]
*  be a part of it, and I hope that that happens. That's what I'm dedicating myself to now. [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10665.64s)]
*  That's awesome. Getting these hyper-local podcasts. That's a great idea. I think what you're saying is [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10670.199999999999s)]
*  all of it's hopeful. I'm very hopeful, Joe. Of course. Which is great, because being cynical kind [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10677.16s)]
*  of sucks, especially when this really is a very unique time of possibility. A lot of things are [[02:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10682.92s)]
*  happening right now. Yeah, it's a perfect time. And it also feels like even to the people that [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10689.72s)]
*  didn't want what Donald Trump is doing, the idea to keep going with what was happening before, [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10695.64s)]
*  where you had someone running for president that never went through the primary. [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10702.76s)]
*  Constitutional crisis. That's a real question. Right there. Yeah, of course. The soft coup [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10707.16s)]
*  against Biden. All that, that should disturb you that that didn't, well, it should be good that [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10711.0s)]
*  that didn't work, because that's not good for anybody, because if they can keep doing it that [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10716.439999999999s)]
*  way, then you never have a primary again. Well, primaries, of course, are up to the party. It's [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10719.8s)]
*  not necessarily a constitutional thing, but that should tell the Democrat people who vote Democrat [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10724.6s)]
*  and are part of it. I've never been a part of a party. I'm not that interested. I vote for people, [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10729.800000000001s)]
*  but that should tell them something like, yeah, there's something bad going on here. Yeah, [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10734.76s)]
*  there's some shenanigans going on. They could have had a primary. What was it like in DC [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10738.52s)]
*  when you went for the inauguration? Was it just like show business for ugly people? There were [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10742.84s)]
*  a million people all over the place. Million people all over the place. It was packed. Was it nuts? [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10746.76s)]
*  It was weird. We did a lot. Yeah, very weird because you go into I went to a lot of these [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10751.88s)]
*  things. I went to a few of these things like these dinners, stuff, balls. Yeah. And it's a [[02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10756.92s)]
*  lot of people that donated a lot of money. And so it's very transactional and everybody's hyper [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10761.16s)]
*  aggressive to get photographs and talk to people. And they they interject themselves in the [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10765.88s)]
*  conversations, interrupt, stand right in front of people that you're talking to and want pictures [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10771.64s)]
*  or want to introduce themselves. And it's it's very entitled and very transactional. And [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10776.92s)]
*  but I think that's always been the nature of politics, particularly with people. [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10783.0s)]
*  The reason why they were there is because they donated a substantial amount of money. [[02:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10786.6s)]
*  Million million bucks a poppy. Yeah, which is nuts. Like how much how this many people have a [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10789.4s)]
*  million dollars to donate. This is crazy. Amazing, isn't it? Amazing. A lot of people got a million [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10793.8s)]
*  bucks. It's like it's all that USAID money. I don't know what it is. Well, there are a lot [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10798.6s)]

*  like, Mick Jagger is right there. That's actually him. And he's dancing a button. [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10859.64s)]
*  And he's this big. His butt's that that boy stick. Yeah. But it's crazy. Right. You know, [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10865.4s)]

*  like, that's one of those things you're like, I can't believe that's really him. And that's what [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10891.800000000001s)]
*  it's like when you're like looking over there, like, holy shit, that's George W. Bush. Do you think it [[03:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10895.960000000001s)]
*  was the real Biden or the daddy long legs Biden? I think it was a real one. OK, I think because [[03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10900.36s)]
*  you've seen the daddy long legs guy. He wasn't too tall. Yeah. Yeah. It was like that one guy was [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10905.800000000001s)]

*  about that. Like, is that there's any paperwork on who that guy actually was? I'd love that. [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10915.8s)]
*  Not Joe Biden. That's a guy with a mask on the mask. Things are real. I can tell you. I can tell [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10919.96s)]
*  you this from family, from family experience. You can see them online from family experience. Yes. [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10924.92s)]
*  Yeah. In 1967, let's just leave the family members out of it. But someone brought home a colleague from [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10930.599999999999s)]
*  work and the colleague had dinner and had coffee and then at dessert, the wife was sitting there, [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10939.72s)]
*  been talking to this person. And then this colleague took off his mask and it was someone [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10948.039999999999s)]
*  who the wife knew extremely well and had no idea. 1967. Whoa. So imagine what they can do now. The [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10953.64s)]
*  stuff that that CIA lady shows on the YouTube video. Yeah. That's I think that's just old. I [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10961.56s)]
*  mean, it's amazing. 67. That stuff already existed and worked. How come they couldn't get somebody [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10966.44s)]
*  Biden's height? You know, that's Tina says that too. I said, you know, they just didn't care at [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10972.36s)]
*  that point. Just like they needed someone who had his cadence, which I think is harder to do to [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10977.560000000001s)]
*  to be kind of, you know, like that stumbling bumbling. Also, like how many people do you [[03:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10982.28s)]
*  bring this to? Like, you know, what does that guy doing now? He needs a broadcast. He's got no, [[03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10986.6s)]

*  possible. Yeah. So there's no, there's a lot of that going on. I mean, we've spotted throughout [[03:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=10998.52s)]
*  the years, Hillary Clinton had, I know she had a double, uh, and it was actually women who noticed [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=11003.24s)]
*  it, like she's carrying her handbag on the other shoulder. It's like, no woman switches that up. [[03:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=11009.56s)]
*  That never happens. And you look at it like, yeah, she does look a little different, but it's also, [[03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=11014.92s)]
*  isn't that a mind fuck though? Cause then you start looking at everybody like, that's not the [[03:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=11019.16s)]

*  I hope some of that comes out too, but you know, it would be great to know these things. It would, [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=11028.84s)]
*  it would be great to stop lying. Yeah. Yeah. Basically, basically you should not have a, [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=11033.08s)]
*  I mean, is there some sort of national security explanation that you could give for why you would [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=11038.52s)]
*  have to have a fake president? Well, I mean, Holy moly. Have you ever seen the Kevin Klein movie? [[03:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=11042.92s)]
*  Right. Yeah. I mean, there it is. There's your, what's it? No, no, like the dog. Uh, Dave, Dave. [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=11049.72s)]

*  everything, but we will become a lot wiser. I'm, I'm convinced of it and I'm excited. I am 60 years [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=11069.32s)]

*  this. It's a tougher for them. Like the UK, they don't really have a first amendment like we do. [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=11087.0s)]
*  So it's like, you hurt someone's feelings on Facebook, you go into jail. I mean, so they, [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=11092.279999999999s)]
*  they got a lot of work to do. Um, but you know, I think Germany has a shot. You know, I think, [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=11095.96s)]

*  point the people will just not take it anymore. And it could get ugly over there, but they, [[03:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=11113.16s)]
*  people are people. I mean, we've had revolutions ourselves. We've been pretty good at it. Yeah. [[03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=11119.48s)]
*  You know, of course we got guns, you know, that was a smart move founders. Yeah. First and second, [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYGG84s1a28&t=11125.08s)]
