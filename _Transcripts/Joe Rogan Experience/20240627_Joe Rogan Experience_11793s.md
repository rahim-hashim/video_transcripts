# Joe Rogan Experience #1891 - Duncan Trussell
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6.0s)]
*  Hello Duncan! Hello! [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=14.0s)]
*  I don't think this is gonna work. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=18.0s)]
*  Oh my god I can't see. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=25.0s)]
*  Oh fuck! [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=27.0s)]
*  I can't see at all. I don't know how you're supposed to see out of that. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=31.0s)]
*  It's a deadly outfit. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=33.0s)]
*  I guess I'll just put that on when I want to say something incriminating. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=36.0s)]
*  Yeah. What do you mean? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=39.0s)]
*  Well the thought police. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=41.0s)]
*  So pull up that article Jamie at the beginning of this podcast. We should probably go right into this. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=43.0s)]
*  Because apparently the Department of Homeland Security and Twitter were working together. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=50.0s)]
*  Are we on? Yeah. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=59.0s)]
*  I don't hear. There we go. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=61.0s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security was, they had a plan to police information and they were working with Twitter in some fashion. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=63.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=73.0s)]
*  What does that mean? I don't know. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=79.0s)]
*  Shit. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=99.0s)]
*  Dun dun dun. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=103.0s)]
*  Malinformation is a weird one. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=129.0s)]
*  Malinformation? Yeah. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=131.0s)]
*  Because it's factual. But it's shared. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=133.0s)]
*  Typically out of context. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=135.0s)]
*  Out of context. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=137.0s)]
*  With harmful intent. That's where you're like, look you don't understand why we mowed down those reporters with the chopper. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=139.0s)]
*  It's out of context. You can't just show the video. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=146.0s)]
*  So that's been wound down. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=162.0s)]
*  Apparently. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=164.0s)]
*  Look at that. Platforms have got to get comfortable with government. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=180.0s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=184.0s)]
*  I don't know. Tim Poole sent me this this morning. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=186.0s)]
*  I didn't get a chance to read. I was in the gym. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=188.0s)]
*  Look, you got to get comfortable with government. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=190.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I've been saying. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=192.0s)]
*  Just get comfortable. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=194.0s)]
*  Cozy up. Put on some sweatpants. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=196.0s)]
*  Cozy up. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=198.0s)]
*  Wow. That's creepy. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=202.0s)]
*  I mean, I guess we all kind of suspected it though, right? It's not like anybody. Is that a shocker? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=204.0s)]
*  Well, what Tim Poole said is that Twitter was working with them. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=212.0s)]
*  That they I guess they weren't being honest about it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=216.0s)]
*  They were working with them. Will you tell me that Jimmy Kimmel tweeted something and tried to delete it? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=221.0s)]
*  Yeah, it looks like I could be wrong about this, but Kimmel was pissed at Musk. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=227.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=233.0s)]
*  For buying Twitter. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=234.0s)]
*  Why does he care? What does he mad about? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=235.0s)]
*  So basically, like a lot of people seem to be really upset with Elon for buying Twitter because Elon is saying that he's not going to censor Twitter anymore. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=237.0s)]
*  He's going to like let you know all the band people are going to get back on. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=253.0s)]
*  Apparently, you know, it's like they're trying to figure it out how to do it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=256.0s)]
*  And so this is upset a lot of people who were happy with the idea that it was being like hyper moderated in a way I think that fits in with their politics. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=260.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=271.0s)]
*  That was the idea. So it's like so like their team was in control for a second. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=272.0s)]
*  And now somebody you know what it reminds me of? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=276.0s)]
*  It's like when a new Booker shows up at a comedy club and all the comics start talking shit. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=279.0s)]
*  It's like scary. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=287.0s)]
*  It has been interesting over the years to watch you blossom from the electric car guy into a fully formed piece of shit. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=288.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=297.0s)]
*  And look, see, it says this tweet was deleted by the tweet author. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=298.0s)]
*  Learn more. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=302.0s)]
*  He was replying to a tweet that Elon tweeted. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=303.0s)]
*  And what was the tweet? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=306.0s)]
*  Elon deleted, which I think was the thing. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=307.0s)]
*  That was a tweet where it's this it's like the Santa Monica Observer or something like that was tweeting something about the Paul Pelosi attack. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=308.0s)]
*  And that Santa Monica Observer has been known to tweet things that aren't that aren't correct or at least has or not tweet published things that aren't correct. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=318.0s)]
*  At least has in one instance that they were citing something about Hillary Clinton. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=328.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=334.0s)]
*  But, you know, he I think what Elon tweeted was there's a tiny chance that we might not be getting the full story. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=335.0s)]
*  And then he tweeted that story. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=345.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=346.0s)]
*  This is the idea that maybe Paul Pelosi knew this guy because people have been trying to pin that guy and say that he was a right wing MAGA guy. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=347.0s)]
*  But didn't he live in like some fucking hippie collective and he made like hemp jewelry? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=356.0s)]
*  He did woot a cube pipeline. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=361.0s)]
*  He went woot a queue. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=363.0s)]
*  So like he apparently had some kind of blog or something. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=365.0s)]
*  I think he started off woo super hippie ayahuasca mystical and then gradually kind of devolved into Q. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=370.0s)]
*  Q Anon. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=382.0s)]
*  Q Anon. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=383.0s)]
*  The best analysis I saw of it was a reporter saying that what the real story here is not like is that there's people who are psychotic all over San Francisco from doing so much speed, meth, drugs. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=384.0s)]
*  That's the real story. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=399.0s)]
*  The real story is that all over like the great cities of America, people are like high as a fucking kite and have been for so long that they're like spinning out of control. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=400.0s)]
*  And that's what it is. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=411.0s)]
*  That's the story of stories is like, yeah, sure. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=412.0s)]
*  This guy went woot a queue. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=414.0s)]
*  Very common. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=417.0s)]
*  It happens. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=418.0s)]
*  You start off. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=419.0s)]
*  You're like into like taking supplements. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=420.0s)]
*  That leads to a new supplement you've never heard of. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=423.0s)]
*  That leads to like some weird website you go to. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=426.0s)]
*  The next thing you know, you're rubbing weird balm all over your body with under a crystal. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=429.0s)]
*  Still fine. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=436.0s)]
*  Still cool. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=437.0s)]
*  But somewhere along the way, you get on like one of these slides that lead you down into Q. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=438.0s)]
*  And then the next thing you know, you're like completely like deep in that. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=445.0s)]
*  So that's what I've heard. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=450.0s)]
*  He's woot a queue. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=451.0s)]
*  Woot a queue pipeline. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=452.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=453.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=454.0s)]
*  I like that term. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=455.0s)]
*  Is that a new term? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=456.0s)]
*  Woot a queue? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=457.0s)]
*  I've never heard that before. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=458.0s)]
*  It's been floating around for a little bit. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=459.0s)]
*  It's just like it's just one of the, you know, it's one of the things that happens. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=460.0s)]
*  It's like, you know, Robert Anton Wilson, the great Robert Anton Wilson. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=463.0s)]
*  His recommendation is maintain agnosticism when it comes to the exploration philosophically of these, of anything really. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=467.0s)]
*  But so when you're contemplating this or that, let yourself believe it. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=475.0s)]
*  But don't believe it all the way. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=479.0s)]
*  Maintain agnosticism. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=481.0s)]
*  You can like play around with the idea that the earth is flat. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=482.0s)]
*  You can play around with the idea that the Illuminati elite run the planet. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=486.0s)]
*  You can play around with any idea you want. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=491.0s)]
*  You can play around with any idea you want, in fact, in the great simulator of your brain. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=493.0s)]
*  But don't go all the way. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=497.0s)]
*  If you go all the way, that's where you can start like spiraling out. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=499.0s)]
*  And here, Wu Anon, the creep of QAnon into Southern California's New Age world. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=504.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=511.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=512.0s)]
*  Woot a queue. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=513.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=514.0s)]
*  Woot a queue pipeline right there. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=518.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=520.0s)]
*  So this is a new thing. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=521.0s)]
*  You know, I think part of the problem with a lot of these theories is that some people, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=522.0s)]
*  I'm just going to try to say this as kindly as possible, they don't have good brains. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=529.0s)]
*  And I say this as a person who has like a decent brain. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=537.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=540.0s)]
*  But I know people with fantastic brains. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=541.0s)]
*  It's not, there's no fairness. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=543.0s)]
*  You know, I met this guy the other night. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=546.0s)]
*  I met this poor guy. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=549.0s)]
*  I don't know what was wrong with him. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=550.0s)]
*  He was like hunched over. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=551.0s)]
*  And, you know, he was very, very frail and hunched over. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=553.0s)]
*  And whether this is because of a disease or whether this is because I don't know what was wrong. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=557.0s)]
*  Something was wrong with him. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=562.0s)]
*  And I'm like, this is not fair. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=564.0s)]
*  It's not fair. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=565.0s)]
*  This guy got just a shit roll of the dice. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=566.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=570.0s)]
*  Now he has this body that's failing him. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=571.0s)]
*  And then you can meet someone like Francis Ngano, who has this insanely perfect body. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=572.0s)]
*  Like he's like the super alpha UFC heavyweight champion. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=578.0s)]
*  Six foot six, two hundred and sixty five pounds of just pure athleticism. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=582.0s)]
*  It's not fair. It's not fair. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=590.0s)]
*  And then that the same applies to, I think, everything. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=592.0s)]
*  Like all sorts of aspects of being a human being. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=597.0s)]
*  And the same applies to the way your brain works. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=600.0s)]
*  And if you're a person who, unfortunately, for no fault of your own, you have this brain that's like not that good. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=603.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=613.0s)]
*  And it can't discern things that are illogical. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=614.0s)]
*  It can't make reasonable conclusions. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=618.0s)]
*  It can't look at things objectively. It just can't. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=621.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=623.0s)]
*  It's like a two gear car. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=624.0s)]
*  It's like, brrrr, boom, boom, boom. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=627.0s)]
*  And then other people have a Tesla and that thing can just sort of maneuver around. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=630.0s)]
*  Oh, I see what's going on here. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=636.0s)]
*  Oh, this is a conflux of all these conspiracy theories that all come together. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=638.0s)]
*  And this person has unfortunately adopted these wholesale and hasn't looked into them at all. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=642.0s)]
*  And now thinks there's lizard people that are shape changers that are behind closed doors that are running the world and that are trying to collapse all the societies. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=649.0s)]
*  You know, there's a real benefit to letting the fucking culture figure out what's right and what's wrong. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=659.0s)]
*  But along the way, people are going to get tricked. They're going to get duped. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=668.0s)]
*  And some people are going to fall into the hands of very manipulative people that are very charismatic. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=673.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=680.0s)]
*  And they have wacky fucking ideas about lizard people or whatever it is. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=681.0s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=686.0s)]
*  Look at fucking Heaven's Gate, Jonestown. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=687.0s)]
*  Yep. Yep. Fuck. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=691.0s)]
*  Think of that. Like how out of it do you have to be to get to the point where someone is like, it's time to drink cyanide or and you know, you've been doing the test or something every day for a while. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=692.0s)]
*  But how out of it? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=704.0s)]
*  Like if you want to see, that's what's scary about being human. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=706.0s)]
*  We're hackable. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=710.0s)]
*  We're fucking hackable. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=711.0s)]
*  And people are really good at hacking us. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=713.0s)]
*  And you might think you have the most incredible mind of all time, but you're still susceptible in the same way. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=717.0s)]
*  You got a great immune system. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=725.0s)]
*  Have you ever been hypnotized? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=726.0s)]
*  Yeah, I got hypnotized. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=728.0s)]
*  My mom hypnotized me and a wart came off my hand. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=729.0s)]
*  Isn't that weird? She was like studying psychology. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=733.0s)]
*  She hypnotized me. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=736.0s)]
*  I had this wart on this finger. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=737.0s)]
*  And then over the next few days, it just kind of like fell off. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=739.0s)]
*  Hypnosis is real, man. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=743.0s)]
*  Yeah, it really does work. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=745.0s)]
*  But what it is is not what everybody thinks it is. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=747.0s)]
*  I think before. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=750.0s)]
*  Well, I should just correct that. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=751.0s)]
*  It's not what I thought it was. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=753.0s)]
*  I thought like you don't know what's going on and you go into like some sort of a trance and the person can get you to do anything. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=755.0s)]
*  Give me your ATM code. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=761.0s)]
*  But but what it really is, is like it puts you in a state of mind where you're very aware. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=763.0s)]
*  You're in the state of mind. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=768.0s)]
*  And I've been thinking about it a lot. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=770.0s)]
*  And I've been thinking about like the cult thing a lot and just the cult of joining one party or another party to, you know, like deciding you're a conservative or deciding you're a progressive. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=772.0s)]
*  I think it's a part of the design of the human animal that got us to cooperate in tribes. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=784.0s)]
*  I think in order for things to work and function, you have to have a very strong inclination that there's one leader. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=793.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=801.0s)]
*  And then, you know, you have to have resistance to that to find the better next leader. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=802.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=807.0s)]
*  And so that's where people get angry at this one person that's running the whole thing. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=808.0s)]
*  But I think that when you scale that out to like 300 million people, it just doesn't work. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=813.0s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=819.0s)]
*  It's chaos. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=820.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=821.0s)]
*  We didn't design it for that. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=822.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=824.0s)]
*  Or whatever designed us, I should say, didn't design us for that. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=825.0s)]
*  Designed us for like tribes of 150 people. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=829.0s)]
*  I think what the Internet is, is the great connector. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=833.0s)]
*  And the Internet is connecting reality with this animal that desires to have a singular leader. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=838.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=846.0s)]
*  Because it wants someone to protect the tribe. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=847.0s)]
*  But then the Internet is like spitting and pissing and shitting all over that. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=848.0s)]
*  It's like an antidote to it. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=853.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=855.0s)]
*  Like Twitter's fact checking the President of the United States' incorrect facts. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=856.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=862.0s)]
*  Which is crazy that that's happening. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=863.0s)]
*  Well, this is the emperor wears no clothes. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=866.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=869.0s)]
*  That's the fable, right? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=870.0s)]
*  Like naked dudes going around. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=871.0s)]
*  Everybody's scared of them. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=873.0s)]
*  They're like, beautiful robes. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=875.0s)]
*  And then some kid is like, he's naked. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=877.0s)]
*  Look, he's obviously naked. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=879.0s)]
*  And then another person's like, oh yeah, you're right. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=881.0s)]
*  He is. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=884.0s)]
*  It's like that is the pot. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=885.0s)]
*  That is the, like, I guess the hope of the Internet is that truth comes out and it destabilizes bad power, bad structures. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=887.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=897.0s)]
*  You want to. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=898.0s)]
*  You want to throw a monkey wrench into shit that doesn't work so that it like stops working and you rebuild. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=899.0s)]
*  Instead of patching up old wobbly things that are like smokes coming out, gears are flying off and you're supposed to pretend like it's working. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=904.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=914.0s)]
*  That's where it gets creepy. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=915.0s)]
*  It's like, you know, if the if the machine that is failing starts telling tech companies or whoever, like what is real and what isn't, then a broken machine is then like articulating truth, which then so if someone starts telling the truth, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=916.0s)]
*  the impen wears no clothes. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=933.0s)]
*  And then like Twitter throws up underneath like this is potential misinformation or whatever. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=934.0s)]
*  That's why this Department of Homeland Security thing is so creepy, because that would be the same people, the same people that are telling you things that are factually inaccurate or that are getting fact checked on Twitter would be the very people that would get to dictate what is malinformation. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=943.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=962.0s)]
*  Like malinformation was the craziest one. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=963.0s)]
*  Like everybody thinks you shouldn't be able to say things that aren't true. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=965.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=968.0s)]
*  Or if you do, you must correct them. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=969.0s)]
*  Like, are you are you telling the truth? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=972.0s)]
*  Are you manipulating with lies? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=974.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=975.0s)]
*  He can't manipulate with lies. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=976.0s)]
*  So if maybe you said something and you thought it was true, let's correct that. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=977.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=982.0s)]
*  But if you just keep doing that over and over and over again, you never admit that. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=983.0s)]
*  And then you're the one who gets to dictate what's malinformation. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=987.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=991.0s)]
*  It's like the death throes of a dying system. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=992.0s)]
*  And it's reaching out in a time and it's acting and behaving the way it used to be able to behave when it had total access to what gets in what people get informed about or not. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=996.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1008.0s)]
*  It had complete control of that at one point in time. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1009.0s)]
*  Well, it's massive. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1011.0s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about how many offices are filled with people working for the government right now. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1013.0s)]
*  Like how many if you put them in a in a building, like with the building go all the way to the moon, like a high rise that probably the moon will be covered with government office buildings. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1018.0s)]
*  But like it's it's massive. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1027.0s)]
*  And then it's so huge that, you know, just people get put into departments and some and some of the people that get put in the departments are good, smart people. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1029.0s)]
*  And some of the people that get put in the departments, they suck. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1039.0s)]
*  Like everything in all walks of life. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1042.0s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1045.0s)]
*  That's all it takes. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1046.0s)]
*  So you get one like everybody's had a shitty manager. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1047.0s)]
*  You get one shitty manager in some job where like he's he's got a little more power than he's supposed to have. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1050.0s)]
*  And then he's probably got people around him or like this is a bad idea. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1057.0s)]
*  And he's like, well, you're fired. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1061.0s)]
*  And then people come in who are like, this is a really good idea. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1062.0s)]
*  He's like, you're a genius if you think this is a good idea, because it is. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1066.0s)]
*  Then you have this like terrible geometry of like where the contagion happens, where this one asshole like starts getting surrounded by concentric circles of assholes. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1069.0s)]
*  And then those people have so much power. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1080.0s)]
*  And and that's I think what's going on with it is it's just like there's just too many people running things. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1082.0s)]
*  And of those people, there's got to be some that are great. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1090.0s)]
*  I know there is. And there's some that are just abject, monstrous, power hungry, coked up assholes. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1093.0s)]
*  And I think that's when you start seeing shit like that is clearly a sign of I mean, again, maybe I'm being naive. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1101.0s)]
*  But I'd like to imagine that that's coming from like a few assholes. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1108.0s)]
*  That's not coming from the totality of the U.S. government. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1112.0s)]
*  All of it is just coming from like what a thousand assholes. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1115.0s)]
*  But then there's also the real problem of actual misinformation that's being spread by bad parties. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1119.0s)]
*  Right. Like we know that we know that there's misinformation that gets spread by bad governments by like our enemies. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1127.0s)]
*  Like we know that there's a whole industry like these Russian troll farms. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1136.0s)]
*  Sure. You know, we've talked about this before, but in on Facebook, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1142.0s)]
*  19 of the top 20 Christian sites were being run by Russian troll farms. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1147.0s)]
*  I remember you saying that. You know how nuts that is? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1152.0s)]
*  That means they're like they're like some conversations that are insane. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1155.0s)]
*  They don't make any sense. Like how is this? How is this a conversation? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1160.0s)]
*  Well, it might not be. It might be. Right. We're getting manipulated. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1163.0s)]
*  It might be there's a bunch of and then the problem with people we were talking about before that we have this natural inclination to follow leaders. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1168.0s)]
*  We do that online too, man. And if there's like some really good tweets that point in a certain direction, people will start agreeing with it. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1174.0s)]
*  Right. People are easily the idea that manipulation only applies to like verbal or or written in a statement. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1181.0s)]
*  No, it fucking applies to tweets too. You can manipulate people. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1188.0s)]
*  Dude, I get manipulated all the fucking time. Are you kidding me? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1191.0s)]
*  I like always getting caught up in bullshit. I like go through like phases of like, yeah, oh my God. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1195.0s)]
*  I I I pendulum between teams or I'll get caught up in some like deep, crazy conspiracy. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1202.0s)]
*  I like I get like I it's a very potent. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1209.0s)]
*  By the way, I'm not saying it's potent because I get manipulated easily, but it's a potent drug. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1212.0s)]
*  Yes, the Internet's a potent drug. There's all kinds of operators. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1217.0s)]
*  It's not just Russian troll forms. It's discordians. It's just basic like trolls who are bored. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1222.0s)]
*  It's who knows what? Probably some cult will never know about just some weird cult on an island somewhere with some nefarious purpose. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1229.0s)]
*  That's like trying to put some certain information on the Internet. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1236.0s)]
*  It's a ocean of madness. And maybe like the the the horrible idea is, OK, we can control the ocean of madness. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1240.0s)]
*  That's what we're going to do, because some of these people are other states trying to cause discord in our society. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1250.0s)]
*  That could lead to a civil war, the collapse of the United States. We've got to do something about this. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1258.0s)]
*  Call up Twitter. Listen, it's a problem. You got to let us tell you what's real and what's not real. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1263.0s)]
*  And at first, maybe that's great. It's like, look, this is 100 percent coming from Russian trolls. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1268.0s)]
*  This this whatever this is, this is Russian A.I. trolls. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1273.0s)]
*  But then of a sudden, the president calls that department like, hey, is there any way that you could also start applying that to people who say that? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1276.0s)]
*  I seem like I'm kind of out of it. You know what I mean? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1287.0s)]
*  But it's not even him. He's not making that call. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1295.0s)]
*  It's like, yeah, his butler. It's all about. Imagine. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1298.0s)]
*  Just imagine, you know, like if you're a lawyer and you have like a sneaky suspicion that your client is probably guilty, but it's your job to get them off. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1301.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's your job. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1315.0s)]
*  If you have your lawyer, your job is not to make a judgment in your head. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1318.0s)]
*  I think maybe this guy's lying and maybe he did it. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1324.0s)]
*  No, your judgment is to try to get your client off. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1327.0s)]
*  Right. And that's why a lot of defense attorneys, man, that's a slippery fucking weird world to be in. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1330.0s)]
*  Right. Well, don't you think it's the same way in the government? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1337.0s)]
*  If you're a person, if you're if you're that poor lady who's the White House press secretary, worst job on earth, fucking worst job. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1340.0s)]
*  It's the worst job. You get all the hate of the president and none of the power. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1349.0s)]
*  Yeah. Fucking everybody hates you. Yeah. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1354.0s)]
*  You're like a punching bag. You just have to absorb that every day. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1356.0s)]
*  And you're under like extreme stress. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1360.0s)]
*  You're a person like no one knows who you are. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1364.0s)]
*  All of a sudden you have to speak publicly for the country. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1367.0s)]
*  That is such an insane role. Yeah. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1370.0s)]
*  And to be young like this lady is doing it now. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1373.0s)]
*  Like how old is she? 30 something? Young. She's so young. Young. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1376.0s)]
*  To be in a position like that where you have like notebook in front of you and you have to answer these complex questions. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1380.0s)]
*  What the fuck is going on in Yemen? Right. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1388.0s)]
*  Why are we giving so much money to Ukraine? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1391.0s)]
*  What the president feels, the president, you're fucking talking for the whole country. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1393.0s)]
*  Yeah. That's such a crazy role. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1398.0s)]
*  You have to like go into a meeting and they tell you what your problem. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1401.0s)]
*  She's 48. She looks great. God damn. I thought she was like 33. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1407.0s)]
*  She's healthy as fuck. Healthy. Healthy press secretary. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1411.0s)]
*  But yeah, you got to go in a meeting. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1415.0s)]
*  You have to like they're going to tell you like, look, they're going to ask you about this for sure. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1417.0s)]
*  Yesterday, we saw the vice president and the vice president, this obviously didn't happen. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1423.0s)]
*  The vice president grabbed a baby out of someone's arms and threw the baby on the ground. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1430.0s)]
*  Now, the reason this happened is because we accidentally dosed her with some new MK Ultra shit. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1436.0s)]
*  And she thought that she was like a Greek goddess and the baby was like a Hydra head. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1443.0s)]
*  Don't worry about it. It was a bad experiment. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1448.0s)]
*  But anyway, you they're going to ask you why did the vice president throw the fucking baby on the ground? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1451.0s)]
*  You'll tell them we drugged her with an accidently with MK Ultra drug. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1456.0s)]
*  You got to say low blood sugar. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1460.0s)]
*  The vice president is having low blood sugar and her hands shook and she didn't really throw the baby, obviously. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1464.0s)]
*  You've got to like go out there with that just load of shit and figure out a way to say it. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1470.0s)]
*  Not just to like one reporter, but to like 20. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1475.0s)]
*  They did like one will ask in the whole world, the whole world's watching. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1478.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. You have to come up with some weird turn of phrase. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1482.0s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1485.0s)]
*  Like when she had to explain why Joe Biden was bringing up a woman who was dead, top of mind, top of mind. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1487.0s)]
*  She was top of mind. Yeah. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1495.0s)]
*  I mean, it was really like the it was like for what she had to work with. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1497.0s)]
*  It was some incredible gaslighting. Amazing. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1503.0s)]
*  She stuck to top of mind. Top of mind is a good one because it's nonsense. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1506.0s)]
*  Because you're sitting there thinking like, what is top of mind mean? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1510.0s)]
*  It's a new thing. You're getting distracted by it. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1513.0s)]
*  You're like, it's top of mind. Top of mind. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1516.0s)]
*  And she just kept saying top of mind, you know, top of mind. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1519.0s)]
*  Top of mind. OK, what? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1523.0s)]
*  Reporters are like, but but they're all thinking is I don't even know that top of mind exists. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1526.0s)]
*  That's brilliant, because I don't think she just came up with top of mind. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1533.0s)]
*  I think they're sitting back there like just say top of mind. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1537.0s)]
*  I think I think that exactly is probably what happens. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1540.0s)]
*  There's probably some sort of consultation on what's the best phrasing. Top of mind. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1544.0s)]
*  Top of mind sounds good. Yeah, top of mind. That's good. That's real good. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1548.0s)]
*  That's her job. Just like a defense attorney. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1552.0s)]
*  It's their job to try to get their client off. That's her job. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1555.0s)]
*  What? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1560.0s)]
*  What happened? Oh, that was I thought you had an interjection. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1562.0s)]
*  No, it was just the hurt. Here we go. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1567.0s)]
*  Was, as you all know, you guys were watching today's event, a very important event on food insecurity. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1570.0s)]
*  It was after he said called out her name when she was dead. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1577.0s)]
*  I think that's a great point. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1587.0s)]
*  I think that's a great point. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1589.0s)]
*  I think that's a great point. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1591.0s)]

*  I think that's a great point. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1595.0s)]
*  I think that's a great point. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1597.0s)]
*  I think that's a great point. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1599.0s)]
*  I think that's a great point. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1601.0s)]

*  I think that's a great point. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1611.0s)]
*  I just explained she was on top of mind. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1613.0s)]
*  I just explained she was on top of mind. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1615.0s)]
*  Look at her eyes fluttering. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1617.0s)]
*  What we were able to witness today and what the president was able to lift up at this conference, at this event, was how her focus on wanting to deal with, combat food insecurity in America. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1619.0s)]
*  Pause, pause please. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1637.0s)]
*  Imagine if this is someone working for you. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1639.0s)]
*  Imagine if you're in an office somewhere. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1641.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1643.0s)]
*  Duncan, you're the CEO of a corporation. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1644.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1645.0s)]
*  And something like this happens and this person explains what happened to you. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1646.0s)]
*  You'd go, I can't have you work for me anymore because you're a liar. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1650.0s)]
*  Oh, I thought you meant. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1654.0s)]
*  Like you're lying. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1655.0s)]
*  I thought you meant like. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1656.0s)]

*  The news cycle won't you can't keep going back to top of mind. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1704.0s)]
*  The news cycles got to move on. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1707.0s)]
*  They know that you just you just like, you know, slow it down enough and then some other shit happens and then everybody gets memory hold. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1709.0s)]

*  But just because I've been plastered on ketamine all the fucking time. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1809.0s)]
*  I'd be like so high because it's the only way you could cope with it. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1813.0s)]
*  How could you even cope with it if you're high? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1817.0s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1819.0s)]
*  If you were a logical person, you'd be like, we have to disband this position. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1820.0s)]
*  This position is ridiculous. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1823.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1824.0s)]

*  Yeah, I'll be a good king to the land. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1832.0s)]
*  It's a brutal job. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1835.0s)]
*  It works if there's 150 people. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1837.0s)]
*  What do they get paid? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1839.0s)]
*  It's not a good salary for what they get. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1840.0s)]
*  What is it? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1843.0s)]
*  400k, I think. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1844.0s)]
*  400k? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1845.0s)]
*  We're paying our fucking president. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1846.0s)]
*  That's one Burt Kreischer show. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1847.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1849.0s)]
*  We should be paying them more. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1850.0s)]
*  If we're paying them more, maybe more people will be getting the job. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1852.0s)]
*  Shouldn't they get at least like what, I don't know, an A celebrity gets for one movie? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1856.0s)]
*  Shouldn't they at least get that? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1863.0s)]
*  We're going to pay them half a million dollars to like... [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1865.0s)]
*  What's even creepier is they all wind up being insanely wealthy. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1868.0s)]
*  I wonder how that happens. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1872.0s)]
*  It's really interesting. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1874.0s)]
*  What happens is they give speeches. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1876.0s)]
*  So they give speeches to these people that help them get into position of being a president. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1879.0s)]
*  Say if there's a large corporation. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1885.0s)]
*  A large corporation, they donate a lot of money towards campaigns and they also... [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1887.0s)]
*  Wink, wink. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1892.0s)]
*  We'd love to hear you talk some day. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1893.0s)]
*  Wait, you're not saying the corporations that give hundreds of millions of dollars for the president to come give the speech are actually secretly bribing them, are you joking? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1894.0s)]
*  Well, that doesn't even make sense. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1902.0s)]
*  No one would think that. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1904.0s)]
*  Why would you do that? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1905.0s)]
*  I would just think it's a really fortuitous pipeline to insane wealth to become a president and then give speeches. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1906.0s)]
*  Well, listen, if I was running a big corporation, you better believe I'd love to have a president come and give a five minute speech. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1914.0s)]
*  A friend of mine saw Hillary Clinton speak once. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1920.0s)]
*  What did she say? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1923.0s)]
*  He said it was really weird. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1924.0s)]
*  It's like you're just watching someone get paid. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1926.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1929.0s)]
*  You're just watching some boring ass speech. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1931.0s)]
*  I remember when Giuliani came to California. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1935.0s)]
*  And some people I know went to see that too. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1938.0s)]
*  And it was the same sort of thing. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1942.0s)]
*  They were like, this is weird. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1943.0s)]
*  It's like right after 9-11. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1944.0s)]
*  And it's like, wow, you're just here to see a guy get paid. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1946.0s)]
*  They're just saying a bunch of things and they're like, okay, another 10 more minutes and then I'm going to get out of here. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1950.0s)]
*  And what am I doing? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1956.0s)]
*  What are those speeches? [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1957.0s)]
*  Imagine a speech that's worth a half a million dollars. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1959.0s)]
*  Imagine you're going to bring a president in and he's going to give a speech to all your CEOs and all these folks. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1963.0s)]
*  It's going to be worth in value to you a half a million dollars. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1969.0s)]
*  Half a million dollars speech is a great speech. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1972.0s)]
*  It's not like Fluffy selling out the Dodger Stadium and crushing and doing standup and having people cry laughing for an hour and a half. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1975.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1982.0s)]
*  He's just going to go. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1983.0s)]
*  He's not an act. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1984.0s)]
*  He's not the Rolling Stones. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1985.0s)]
*  He's not tool. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1986.0s)]
*  He's just going to go up there and they're going to talk about things that everybody already agrees on. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1988.0s)]
*  Like the environment is a real issue. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1993.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=1995.0s)]

*  Like what do they say? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2003.0s)]
*  What kind of information do you have that you like? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2004.0s)]

*  It's like well half a billion. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2012.0s)]
*  If you press your taint seven times and then pull your earlobes down, your hair will grow back and it actually works. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2013.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2022.0s)]

*  But yeah. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2025.0s)]

*  Oh, you mean the president? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2029.0s)]

*  Right. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2036.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2037.0s)]
*  I mean, it's like what's funny about this sort of thing is it's inarguably true. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2038.0s)]
*  Like it's just you can't describe it in any other way. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2043.0s)]
*  It's like the we can't just handbags of money to people when we want them to like do do things for us and the government. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2048.0s)]
*  But we can like hide it and do a speech. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2056.0s)]
*  You can't. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2060.0s)]
*  The funny thing is it has to be a speech because like that is a thing. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2061.0s)]
*  It's like, why do you quantify the the worth of a presidential speech? [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2064.0s)]
*  You can't have them come and say like paint the wall or like clean a bathroom and you give them four hundred thousand dollars. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2068.0s)]
*  It has to be a speech. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2074.0s)]
*  And so it's like all of this stuff, it's all out there. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2075.0s)]
*  It's 100 percent true. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2080.0s)]
*  We're not being cynical or conspiratorial. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2081.0s)]
*  It's fucking weird to pace anybody that much for a speech, much less somebody who's still in power and is going to be responsible for potentially passing legislation or helping legislation pass. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2084.0s)]
*  It's going to massively impact whatever your particular industry is. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2097.0s)]
*  It's obvious what's going on. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2101.0s)]
*  But this is the kind of stuff, speaking of hypnosis, that's like just on the periphery. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2103.0s)]
*  Right. Like if you want to hang out in default reality, you're not really supposed to spend too much time thinking about that. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2108.0s)]
*  You're not supposed to spend too much time thinking about the fact that private corporations and public government sectors of government are weirdly the same thing. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2115.0s)]
*  They're connected by an invisible. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2129.0s)]
*  It's not even invisible. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2131.0s)]
*  Barely invisible. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2133.0s)]
*  Like it's just kind of shadowy. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2134.0s)]
*  You're not supposed to like the idea is the private sector is supposed to be separate from the public sector. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2136.0s)]
*  The private sector, if it influences the public sector, it does it via voting. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2141.0s)]
*  That was the idea of democracy voting, not through like donating money to the campaigns that make them get elected because they have the most money. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2145.0s)]
*  That, you know, because like there's probably the most charismatic, incredible, brilliant dude out there. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2155.0s)]
*  He's got it all figured out for real. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2161.0s)]
*  Like someone who makes JFK look like a complete fucking idiot, like someone like that good. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2163.0s)]
*  And I don't know, he's living somewhere and maybe he's like, man, I think I could really help. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2170.0s)]
*  But he's like, how am I going to raise five hundred million dollars to run a presidential campaign? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2176.0s)]
*  I can't do that. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2183.0s)]
*  So he doesn't run. He can't. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2184.0s)]
*  And if he did try to run, he couldn't get the money to get to the point where the other ones have gotten to because they're being supported by the corporations. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2186.0s)]
*  So really what we've done is like we've managed to filter out all the other people who could be awesome because they can't get the money. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2193.0s)]
*  It's so sad if you think about it really is. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2200.0s)]
*  Remember this last election? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2203.0s)]
*  You're looking at the two choices. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2205.0s)]
*  Like, imagine the Olympics, you know, or any like any other competition. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2208.0s)]
*  Imagine if like you're watching the two finalists in some Olympic, I don't know, gymnastic challenge, I don't know, like tumbling or ice skating. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2214.0s)]
*  And like they both are really bad at fucking ice skating. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2226.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? And you got to pick one. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2230.0s)]
*  It's a binary now, but they're both in different ways. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2232.0s)]
*  They're like really bad at it. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2235.0s)]
*  But you got to pick one. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2237.0s)]
*  That's what really sucks. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2238.0s)]
*  That to me is like the real embarrassment in our country right now is it's like you're giving us a shitty binary every fucking time. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2240.0s)]
*  And if I say I don't want to participate in the binary, people are like, no, don't you get it? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2250.0s)]
*  The state, our country's future is is in your hands. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2255.0s)]
*  You're like, yeah, but I don't like either of them. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2260.0s)]
*  They both seem awful. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2263.0s)]
*  One I don't like the other. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2265.0s)]
*  I don't like me. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2267.0s)]
*  I would not leave my kids alone with either of them. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2268.0s)]
*  I don't want to fucking support it at all. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2272.0s)]
*  But we have to because it's a binary. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2274.0s)]
*  And do you not love your country? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2277.0s)]
*  Do you not believe in democracy? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2279.0s)]
*  But really, you're looking at like surely there were better people than this. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2281.0s)]
*  Like, surely this isn't like the greatest representation of leadership. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2285.0s)]
*  And like if there was if I'm sorry, I'm ranting a little too much. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2291.0s)]
*  No, it's perfect. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2294.0s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2295.0s)]
*  Imagine this. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2296.0s)]
*  We could reverse all the conditioning everyone fucking has been injected with on one side [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2297.0s)]
*  or the other for the last 10 years. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2303.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2305.0s)]
*  Then we like just present like, all right, here's this dude and this dude. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2306.0s)]
*  One is Trump. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2311.0s)]
*  One is Biden. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2312.0s)]
*  Would you like either of these people to be president? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2313.0s)]
*  Who would be like, oh, yeah, let's get the fucking like megalomaniac or let's get the old like man [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2315.0s)]
*  who can't really put a sentence together. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2323.0s)]
*  Those are definitely the best choices out of all the other awesome, charismatic young people out there who you could pick. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2325.0s)]
*  It's really depressing, man. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2334.0s)]
*  It's really depressing. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2336.0s)]
*  And it's sad that we're all at each other's throats fighting over these like, you know what I mean? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2337.0s)]
*  A stupid binary like we're presented with a dumb binary. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2342.0s)]
*  It's I don't know. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2345.0s)]
*  I keep saying fucking. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2347.0s)]
*  No, it's a really good point. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2348.0s)]
*  It's a really good point because that's what separates most people. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2350.0s)]
*  It's not really their values. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2354.0s)]
*  It's that you think the other person is on the other party and the other party is inherently bad. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2356.0s)]
*  Everybody's doing it. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2362.0s)]
*  It's it's mostly incorrect. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2364.0s)]
*  Most people agree on most things. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2367.0s)]
*  Most people are good people. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2369.0s)]
*  Most people we can't concentrate on the ones that aren't the most. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2371.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2376.0s)]
*  And we can't align ourselves with the ones who aren't the most. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2377.0s)]
*  The people that are the most asshole ish on the left that freak you out are just like the people that are most asshole ish on the right that freak you out. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2381.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2389.0s)]
*  They're the the fucking the rare extremes because that's just the spectrum of fucking human beings with any ideology. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2390.0s)]
*  You can have the worst examples and the best examples. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2398.0s)]
*  You can meet Christians that literally make you want to go to church. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2401.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2404.0s)]
*  My God the way this man carries himself the way this woman lives her life the way they talk the way they treat people. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2405.0s)]
*  I want to be like that. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2411.0s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2412.0s)]
*  I want I want to be like that. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2413.0s)]
*  Like they can because they're good at it. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2414.0s)]
*  They're really good. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2417.0s)]
*  They're good. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2418.0s)]
*  And there's that's like that with everything. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2419.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2421.0s)]
*  With everything. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2422.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2423.0s)]
*  With politicians with everything. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2424.0s)]
*  And if we are as a group aligned with only one of two choices and so you're either on this side or you're on that side and you always look at the people across the fence. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2425.0s)]
*  Fuck you. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2434.0s)]
*  And they look at you fucking losers. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2435.0s)]
*  And it's dumb. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2437.0s)]
*  It's dumb. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2439.0s)]
*  And it's the best way to keep us divided. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2440.0s)]
*  It's fucking stupid. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2442.0s)]
*  Most people agree on most things and the things that we disagree on we should be able to talk through. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2444.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2450.0s)]
*  It shouldn't be there should not be a prohibition on a conversation about shit man. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2451.0s)]
*  I don't think that whatever the system is that's picking the people we have to vote for that gets it down to two people. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2457.0s)]
*  I don't think this system is working very well. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2465.0s)]
*  Like any let's imagine you are designing a machine the machine somehow could scan apples. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2469.0s)]
*  You press a button and the machine rolls out two of the best apples out of like 500 apples. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2475.0s)]
*  I don't know why you want the machine. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2481.0s)]
*  You just like good apples. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2482.0s)]
*  But imagine you press a button and two fucking worm filled rotten apples roll out and instead of being like oh shit the machines broken you go like the machine works. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2484.0s)]
*  Clearly these are the best fucking apples. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2496.0s)]
*  Pick one of them. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2499.0s)]
*  You can only pick one of them. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2500.0s)]
*  But don't say our machines broken. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2502.0s)]
*  It's picking the best apples. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2504.0s)]
*  Look they're great. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2506.0s)]
*  It's that. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2507.0s)]
*  And then of course there's going to be like bitterness and fighting and division because it's like like cognitive dissonance man. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2508.0s)]
*  It's like you have to like find a way to fix in your head that you have hitched your fucking wagon to a bad apple. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2517.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2526.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2527.0s)]
*  And that sucks. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2528.0s)]
*  And that's going to create insecurity. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2529.0s)]
*  Insecurity creates fear. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2530.0s)]
*  Anger. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2534.0s)]
*  So then then you just have a shit ton of insecure people battling each other because they're both somehow incapable of saying yeah our guy sucks. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2535.0s)]
*  So does your guy. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2544.0s)]
*  Yeah our guy really sucks too. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2545.0s)]
*  The moment we start saying that then things could get really cool. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2547.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2551.0s)]
*  That's where it could get really interesting because I mean I think we most people should agree like come on. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2552.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2557.0s)]
*  Is your guy really that great. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2558.0s)]
*  You pick which guy it is. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2560.0s)]
*  Really. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2561.0s)]
*  Is that the best example of like an American or a human being. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2562.0s)]
*  Is that the best example. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2566.0s)]
*  I mean would you want that guy to be be alone with your kids. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2567.0s)]
*  And I'm saying you could use this for anybody. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2572.0s)]
*  You could use that test if you don't have kids. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2575.0s)]
*  Would you want that. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2577.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2578.0s)]
*  Would you want that guy to be alone with. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2579.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2581.0s)]
*  I can't fill in the blank if you don't have kids. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2582.0s)]
*  I'm sorry for doing like no no reader talk. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2584.0s)]
*  It's good. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2587.0s)]
*  It's a good one. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2588.0s)]
*  The most the people that you are you're you protect over. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2589.0s)]
*  And I don't mean alone with your kids like they're going to abuse your kids. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2593.0s)]
*  I mean alone. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2596.0s)]
*  I know what you're saying. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2597.0s)]
*  Like are they going to be able to tend to your kid. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2598.0s)]
*  Are they going to remember to feed your kids. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2601.0s)]
*  Are they going to like keep your kids from doing all the crazy shit kids do. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2602.0s)]
*  Will they even be able to pick your kid up and put your kid in the crib. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2605.0s)]
*  Like are they capable of being alone with your children. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2609.0s)]
*  If the answer is no you've got to find someone else for the fucking job. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2613.0s)]
*  They're in charge of all of us. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2618.0s)]
*  They're in charge of all of us. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2620.0s)]
*  You've got to find someone who can like who's like who's going to like be able to do shit that like keeps all of our fucking kids OK. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2621.0s)]
*  You know and if they can't be alone with kids then probably they shouldn't be president. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2630.0s)]
*  If you ask me they shouldn't be president if they can't drive a car. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2634.0s)]
*  I don't think they should be president. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2639.0s)]
*  This isn't an ageist thing to say. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2641.0s)]
*  I mean it's whatever age you are you should be able to drive a car. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2642.0s)]
*  You should know how to like get in a car and drive it down the road and use your turn signals and what the speed limit is. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2646.0s)]
*  It teaches you what everyone goes through every fucking day when they have to drive to work when they're driving. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2652.0s)]
*  So know how to drive a car. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2657.0s)]
*  You should be able to be alone with kids. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2658.0s)]
*  I think this is we should put this in the fucking Constitution. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2660.0s)]
*  Like this we should have built into how we're doing these things like prerequisites prerequisites for the job just like any other job. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2663.0s)]
*  You know it doesn't have to be like intense prerequisites but it's just really depressing you know when there's a prohibition on just pointing out the obvious shit. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2673.0s)]
*  But here's the problem. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2682.0s)]
*  What are the alternatives. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2683.0s)]
*  We have to blow up the system and if you wanted to blow up the system the people that are in power have to lose power. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2685.0s)]
*  They're not going to do that. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2690.0s)]
*  The FBI is like you know what we're not the best at investigating shit. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2692.0s)]
*  You guys take over the CIA is like intelligence. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2696.0s)]
*  Have we done the best. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2699.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2700.0s)]
*  Maybe there's a better option. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2701.0s)]
*  Why don't you guys take it. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2702.0s)]
*  That's fucking never going to happen ever ever ever ever. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2703.0s)]
*  No. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2707.0s)]
*  The idea is just to continue to improve upon the systems that we already have. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2708.0s)]
*  They're not perfect but they're better than nothing. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2711.0s)]
*  And if we blow it all up who the fuck is going to take if we blow it all up it's William Wallace up in this bitch. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2714.0s)]
*  OK. If you decide that this government no longer has power over the people and then a bunch of people start assuming power and saying that they have power. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2719.0s)]
*  You got a real fucking problem. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2727.0s)]
*  I don't think you got to blow it up. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2729.0s)]
*  Don't blow it up. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2730.0s)]
*  I don't think it's even necessary. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2731.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. It's like that's the only way it's going to change. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2733.0s)]
*  I think there's other ways it could change. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2736.0s)]
*  But what it would require is you know OK. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2738.0s)]
*  This is when I say change I mean like a complete restructuring. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2741.0s)]
*  I don't mean like let's make it so the politics don't get bought out by money. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2746.0s)]
*  I mean a way where people have to be informed about the things that they have opinions on that are super critical. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2750.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2758.0s)]
*  I feel like there's a real responsibility for everyone that's involved in all these decision making aspects of voting to know what the fuck the consequences are for real. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2759.0s)]
*  The problem is when it comes to certain things like climate change. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2770.0s)]
*  Right. You say climate change. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2773.0s)]
*  You don't you don't agree with the consensus of climate change. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2775.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2778.0s)]
*  If you don't jump on board immediately people want to bark at you and very very few of them done any research. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2779.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2787.0s)]
*  I'm not saying that climate change is not real. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2788.0s)]
*  I'm just saying when something's like that where it's like this is what it is and the scientists almost immediately I'm like hold on. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2790.0s)]
*  Yeah right. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2799.0s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2800.0s)]
*  How where are you getting this information from and why do you think it's going to be this insane disaster. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2801.0s)]
*  Are you sure. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2809.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2810.0s)]
*  Are you absolutely sure or is it possible that this is this has happened throughout history that people have always. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2811.0s)]
*  Talked about whether it's the ice age is coming whether it's there's always been some big fear mongering thing about some climate disaster. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2817.0s)]
*  It's always happened. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2826.0s)]
*  You know it's funny to me about that stuff is people take themselves out of the climate. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2828.0s)]
*  So it's like people talk about climate change as though the climate were something external. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2832.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2838.0s)]
*  To the human. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2839.0s)]
*  Whereas like there's an interior climate like a subconscious climate a semi conscious climate that like is the sum total of the interior lives of everyone on the planet and that gets left out because we can't quantify. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2840.0s)]
*  It's a climate it's a climate of fear it's a climate of compassion. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2855.0s)]
*  Whatever it could be but it's in their storms. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2858.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2861.0s)]
*  There's storms hurricanes that rip through that. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2862.0s)]
*  Civil War. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2864.0s)]
*  Civil War or just riots or war. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2865.0s)]
*  And so whenever you're seeing a war happen you are looking at like a sort of subjective internal yet collective societal hurricane happening and destroying stuff but it's doing it via like the human system the human bio and we so to me. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2868.0s)]
*  To me I think that there isn't a quick fix to this but Carl Jung Carl Jung you know Carl Jung is he's like Freud's okay Carl Jung I'm sure a million people have already said this on your podcast. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2887.0s)]
*  His idea was that leaders are a projection of the collective unconscious so whatever the world leader is that you're looking at you're actually looking at a physical representation of the internal subjective lives of the collective right so when you see like a Biden you're seeing the shadow of society when you're seeing a Trump it's our shadow that's what you're looking at like this is where. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2902.0s)]
*  Where the inner connectivity interdependence comes up it's like we're all connected whoever the person is that ends up being the mouthpiece for all of us we all have a tiny little thread of quantum energy injected into that thing and we're kind of looking at ourselves part of ourselves we might not want to admit is there so. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2931.0s)]
*  So the idea would be if you can find in your own little internal climate a way to cool it down cool it down stop heating up so much get peace stuff I remember a long time ago man you talked to me about this about like it was really it stuck with me for the longest time because I was more turbulent back then but it's this idea of like. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2951.0s)]
*  Maintaining an even keel you know what I mean find a way to be stable consistently every day in your own life and stability will appear naturally around you right but if you are prone to reactivity anger freak out whatever it is mania whatever the thing is then the people around you they're always kind of worried like what version of this dude am I getting today am I going to be able to do that? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=2974.0s)]
*  I'm going to get the happy version I'm going to get the freaked out version we get the angry version I'm going to get the cool version and if it's really extreme the way your behavior is warping and shifting you could only expect chaos around you because people get nervous around instability right so. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3004.0s)]
*  That then if that was if all of us were reactive like if suddenly a wave of reactivity swept through the whole planet and people started thinking it was normal to like pendulum between moods and to react to the moods and like this is me or what the fuck or extremes then you would expect the representation of all of us to be kind of fucked up. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3020.0s)]
*  And so the idea is if we could all kind of calm down a little bit find some peace find a way to like be actually calm not repressed like you know when you're freaking out on mushrooms and you try to pretend you're not or when you go to a party where they give weed I don't know if you've ever been to an edible weed party and everyone's trying to pretend they're not freaking the fuck out. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3043.0s)]
*  The worst parties. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3063.0s)]
*  Dude I was a judge at a cannabis cup. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3066.0s)]
*  There you go. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3068.0s)]
*  I was like seven eight different flavors in because you have like they give you like a pill box brutal you know like a Monday through Sunday pill box and each one of them has a different strain and you're supposed to test each strain by time you get to Wednesday. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3070.0s)]
*  You have no idea what the fuck you're talking about. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3086.0s)]
*  Yeah man. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3090.0s)]
*  I remember talking to this dude who was telling me about the cannabis community. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3091.0s)]
*  It was really interesting because I was beyond barbecue to the point where like words were coming out and I would hear the sounds that the words would make and I would see the words coming out of the person's mouth. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3094.0s)]
*  But what I got was feelings. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3109.0s)]
*  I got like bars of feelings like registered feelings above each word. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3112.0s)]
*  So as this guy was talking I could tell what he was trying to do and he was trying to say that he loves and appreciates the cannabis community and he feels very close to them as a community and that they all have each other's backs. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3118.0s)]
*  I know if anything goes wrong with me the cannabis community has my back and it was this this thing that he was doing when he was communicating with me because I was so barbecued. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3132.0s)]
*  I got to really that's what we're doing all the time. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3143.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3145.0s)]
*  We're not always just trying to get our words out. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3146.0s)]
*  We're trying to like project a tone and figure out a way to get people to like us more. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3149.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3158.0s)]
*  Or think be more impressed by us. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3159.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3161.0s)]
*  And that's like a giant percentage of what people do when they talk all day. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3162.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3169.0s)]
*  Well it's insecurity. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3170.0s)]
*  I mean it's like the idea is you have I just read this shit man it blew my fucking mind. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3171.0s)]
*  Here's the idea. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3178.0s)]
*  Everything is your mind right. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3181.0s)]
*  So not like spiritual literally everything you see is your mind because your sense organs are taking in phenomena and that's all getting translated via your brain and as something we call reality. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3185.0s)]
*  So literally when you're seeing the color yellow you're seeing your own mind. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3200.0s)]
*  That's the way your mind translates whatever the particular wavelength of yellow is into the thing that you call yellow. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3205.0s)]
*  It's literally your mind. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3212.0s)]
*  Everything you're seeing is your mind. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3213.0s)]
*  That's just the way it is. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3214.0s)]
*  But what happens is we start thinking it's not our mind. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3216.0s)]
*  There's a me and a you every there's an outside me and an inside me even though this is 100 percent not the case. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3221.0s)]
*  There is probably something outside of you but that's not what you're seeing. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3228.0s)]
*  You're seeing an incredible symphony of neurotransmitters that are all harmonizing in a way that produces your reality. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3232.0s)]
*  So when you see an enemy or a friend when you see your someone you love and someone you hate all your mind the feeling of love your mind the feeling of hate your mind. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3240.0s)]
*  So when you get really fucking confused not realizing this is all my mind you start picking shit out this person that person this thing that thing and you would start attaching to it. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3252.0s)]
*  You start attaching to it to try to feel better. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3264.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3266.0s)]
*  So you're like if I can make this person like me I'm going to feel better now I'm going to feel good again or something's going to make me feel better. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3267.0s)]
*  And this is what what you're talking about. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3274.0s)]
*  This is where you begin the never ending cycle in Buddhism called samsara where it's just a never ending attempt to rearrange your mind into some way that is going to give you a sense of like OK everything's fine now never ending never ending. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3277.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3295.0s)]
*  Not only never ending in this life but literally zillions of incarnations you've been doing the same fucking thing over and over again in different ways. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3296.0s)]
*  And so the moment you realize this is my mind this is all my mind then all of a sudden that's when you can that's when she gets really interesting because now you you you might begin to change the way you start trying to get shit out of your mind out of out of like you know getting the thing you desire pushing away. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3304.0s)]
*  You stop defending as much to you're defending against your own fucking mind. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3326.0s)]
*  I mean you know what I mean like so many people are super defensive all the time. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3330.0s)]
*  They're trying to keep themselves from being hurt which is really smart. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3334.0s)]
*  But what they're defending themselves from is words perceived opinions real like high level social animal shit. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3340.0s)]
*  They're not defending themselves against bear attacks lions arrows. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3350.0s)]
*  They're defending themselves against like psychic impacts. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3354.0s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3357.0s)]
*  So it's not even a danger like when someone says some shitty thing to you and you get triggered and then you react to that shitty thing like experiment with not reacting to see what happens if you don't get revenge when the person does the thing to you they always do that you get revenge for. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3358.0s)]
*  You just don't get revenge. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3375.0s)]
*  You just don't do the thing that you thought you had to do or they're going to do it again. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3377.0s)]
*  Watch what happens. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3381.0s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3382.0s)]
*  You're fine. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3383.0s)]
*  Nothing happens. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3384.0s)]
*  You don't need the aggression the defense. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3385.0s)]
*  So yeah man that's really interesting to me. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3387.0s)]
*  It's just your mind and you're at war with your own fucking mind all day long for the rest of your life. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3390.0s)]
*  All day long for the rest of your life every day a raging war against yourself. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3397.0s)]
*  I mean again I'm not saying that you don't need from time to time to set boundaries and tell someone don't fucking do that. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3403.0s)]
*  But at least for me personally a lot of the time the stuff that like I was like getting all bristly about it really was just my own. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3410.0s)]
*  It was my own bullshit. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3420.0s)]
*  There wasn't really anything to get bristly about or to defend against there. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3421.0s)]
*  And when you start doing that kind of like internal peace work man all of a sudden shit around you starts changing because it's your mind. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3427.0s)]
*  The idea is if this is all your mind then if your mind calmed down maybe all this stuff around you would calm down too. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3437.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3445.0s)]
*  That's the idea. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3446.0s)]
*  It might actually be the same thing. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3447.0s)]
*  So if you start getting calm if you start getting a little space between you and your thoughts just maybe just maybe that your enemies won't seem quite like enemies anymore. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3449.0s)]
*  The people that you have been waking up in the middle of the night thinking about pouring acid in their mouth maybe you'll you'll you'll you'll realize it's like that the example that gets that red and then I'll shut the fuck up. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3462.0s)]
*  I'm sorry everybody. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3478.0s)]
*  The example that I read the example that I read was it's like someone shoots an arrow at you and they miss it lands at your feet. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3479.0s)]
*  This is when someone says something shitty to you or you get upset about something someone's doing. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3488.0s)]
*  You don't see that person for weeks maybe but the example is the arrow lands at your feet and you pick it up and you start stabbing yourself with an arrow going why did they shoot me with this arrow. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3492.0s)]
*  I can't believe they did that every time you bring them to your mind every time you wake up thinking about them every time you have that fake conversation when you see him and you're going to one up them. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3502.0s)]
*  That's just you going yeah yeah why did they shoot me with this arrow. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3512.0s)]
*  You know you're just massacring yourself with your own mind. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3516.0s)]
*  You don't have to do that. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3520.0s)]
*  You actually can stop. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3522.0s)]
*  You don't have to constantly be stabbing yourself. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3523.0s)]
*  Yeah that's great advice. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3528.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3530.0s)]
*  No no no it really is great advice. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3531.0s)]
*  And that's the problem with the human mind is it doesn't come with an owner's manual and they're all different. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3533.0s)]
*  You know it's again some of them are lawnmowers some of them are Ferraris. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3540.0s)]
*  Well I mean we don't come with a fucking owner's manual. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3545.0s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3549.0s)]
*  Yeah and you're sorting out some of the most complex things. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3550.0s)]
*  You're sorting out languages that are different emotions that are different. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3555.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3560.0s)]
*  Cultures that are different. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3561.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3562.0s)]
*  Genders that are different. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3563.0s)]
*  All these fucking different things being sorted out in real time why we melt the earth. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3564.0s)]
*  Why the fucking oceans filled up with our garbage and the temperature keeps rising and everyone's like don't worry it's fine buy this Miami beachfront condo. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3571.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3581.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3582.0s)]
*  Yeah that's so sad. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3584.0s)]
*  But the thing is like you know there's too many variables. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3585.0s)]
*  I don't think we have a mind that's designed for the variables that exist in modern society. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3591.0s)]
*  There's too many variables because you're getting news from the entire world. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3597.0s)]
*  So you're getting everything catastrophic that happens among seven point whatever billion people. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3600.0s)]
*  Yeah that's too much data. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3605.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3607.0s)]
*  And you're you're interacting with people that are nowhere near you primarily. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3608.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3614.0s)]
*  Most of your human interactions are coming via cyber world. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3615.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3619.0s)]
*  Which is fucking bizarre to accept. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3620.0s)]
*  And then on top of that you're probably having to sit through traffic and you're probably stacked on top of a bunch of people in an apartment building. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3622.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3631.0s)]
*  And you're probably annoyed that there's so many fucking people around you all. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3632.0s)]
*  It's an unnatural state. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3636.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3637.0s)]
*  For most people. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3638.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3639.0s)]
*  Most people. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3640.0s)]
*  And it's it's all rapidly changing while we remain the same. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3641.0s)]
*  So it's all putting these new demands on us. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3648.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3651.0s)]
*  Why we remain the same biological entity that existed when the railroad was a big freak out. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3652.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3657.0s)]
*  The trains are going to kill people. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3658.0s)]
*  They go too fast. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3660.0s)]
*  That's what they thought. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3661.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3662.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3663.0s)]
*  I think like 35 miles an hour. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3664.0s)]
*  Thirty five after 35 you're dead. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3665.0s)]
*  Fucking meat. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3666.0s)]
*  People are just going to kill. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3667.0s)]
*  It's the same thing we did with 5G. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3668.0s)]
*  They were doing that with trains and they're like that might be real though. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3671.0s)]
*  That might be getting us right now. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3674.0s)]
*  5G. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3675.0s)]
*  Zapping us. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3676.0s)]
*  You know what someone said to me about 5G. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3677.0s)]
*  What? [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3678.0s)]
*  They said that 5G is eventually going to evolve to the point where it could be implemented [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3679.0s)]
*  as like a radar system in someone's home. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3684.0s)]
*  I said that. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3687.0s)]
*  Is that you? [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3689.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3690.0s)]
*  I read that. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3691.0s)]
*  Tell me what you said. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3692.0s)]
*  Oh damn it Joe. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3693.0s)]
*  You know man again let me just we're in clown suits. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3694.0s)]
*  You know what we're in fucking clown suits. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3696.0s)]
*  I'm sorry I forgot it was you that told me. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3698.0s)]
*  I was trying to remember. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3699.0s)]
*  Oh no I don't care. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3700.0s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3701.0s)]
*  Whatever I say after this it's probably wrong. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3702.0s)]
*  But I did it because I go on really weird rabbit holes on the internet and the problem [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3706.0s)]
*  is I don't remember where I get the data from. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3710.0s)]
*  Jamie will find the data. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3713.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3714.0s)]
*  But what was the premise of it? [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3715.0s)]
*  Premise is that potentially 5G could be used as some kind of radar system. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3716.0s)]
*  That like it's so powerful that you could theoretically see people moving inside of [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3721.0s)]
*  buildings using 5G somehow. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3726.0s)]
*  There might be a way to like look at the way the 5G is being like I don't know. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3728.0s)]
*  Doesn't that make sense though that like ultimately that's going to happen. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3733.0s)]
*  And if we have phones and everybody carries a phone with them. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3736.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3739.0s)]
*  So you know where you're unless you you're one of those really rebellious ultra marathon [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3740.0s)]
*  runners who puts his fucking phone in his desk drawer when he gets into work and just [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3744.0s)]
*  leaves it there. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3748.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3749.0s)]
*  Most people have their phone on them. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3750.0s)]
*  So there's proximity tracking. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3751.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3752.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3753.0s)]
*  You know where you are at all points in time. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3754.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3755.0s)]
*  And if you have some sort of a thing that's just like you know the misinformation and [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3756.0s)]
*  malinformation board is requiring that we install these and all chips and all that is [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3760.0s)]
*  doing is utilizing 5D 5G to get a sense of everything that's in the space. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3765.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3770.0s)]
*  It would be if I don't know if it's possible with today's technology but that doesn't seem [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3771.0s)]
*  outrageous at all that they would it's just the fact that you can send a fucking video [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3775.0s)]
*  instantaneously to your friend in Italy like that. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3779.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3783.0s)]
*  Like that. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3784.0s)]
*  You send a video they get it on their iMessage. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3785.0s)]
*  Oh shit that looks cool. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3786.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3787.0s)]
*  That is wild. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3789.0s)]
*  The idea that it could track your movements and know the 3D space around it that doesn't [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3790.0s)]
*  even seem outrageous. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3795.0s)]
*  It's not that outrageous. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3796.0s)]
*  I mean yeah I don't think people really like to deal with how surveilled we already are [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3797.0s)]
*  then because the surveillance is being is broken up among a. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3803.0s)]
*  Fast computers 5G networks and radar that passes through walls are bringing X-ray vision closer [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3808.0s)]
*  to reality. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3813.0s)]
*  It's real. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3814.0s)]
*  Yeah it makes sense. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3815.0s)]
*  There you go. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3816.0s)]
*  So there it is. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3817.0s)]
*  So that was ideas like because. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3818.0s)]
*  Thank God it's real. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3819.0s)]
*  I mean. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3820.0s)]
*  We would have cut it out. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3821.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3822.0s)]
*  We don't want to get in trouble with the new board. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3823.0s)]
*  Malinformation. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3826.0s)]
*  Malinformation. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3827.0s)]
*  That would be misinformation. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3828.0s)]
*  That's even worse than malinformation. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3829.0s)]
*  Dude imagine if like the shit got in your house that's where it gets really creepy like somehow [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3832.0s)]
*  the fact you're like all right well it's it's just the Ministry of Truth on Twitter whatever [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3836.0s)]
*  dude Twitter's dumb I don't care anyway it's just the Ministry of Truth on Facebook or I [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3841.0s)]
*  don't care. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3846.0s)]
*  That's what TikTok is. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3847.0s)]
*  TikTok whatever I don't fucking care. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3848.0s)]
*  You really don't care. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3850.0s)]
*  It's like but imagine if it was just on screens in your house right like if hanging in your [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3851.0s)]
*  house there was I don't know just a light that if someone starts speaking misinformation [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3857.0s)]
*  it starts glowing red or something and you're like oh shit you see what that thing you just [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3862.0s)]
*  said it's like the lights blinking so it's bullshit. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3867.0s)]
*  It would be it would be fucking horrible. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3870.0s)]
*  It'd be scary. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3872.0s)]
*  It's scary but somehow because it's like we still externalize the social media as like [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3873.0s)]
*  an outside space even though it's in our house it's in our pockets right next to us all the [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3878.0s)]
*  time. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3883.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3884.0s)]
*  It seems like all right you know the whatever that is it's just on the outside it's not [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3885.0s)]
*  on the inside yet but it's really it's it's it's kind of is you turn on the TV I don't [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3888.0s)]
*  care what you're fucking watching man. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3894.0s)]
*  It's like OK it's fucked up that everybody knows that most of our politicians in some [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3896.0s)]
*  way shape or form are making money from various. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3904.0s)]
*  How much do you think they make like how much do you think Obama's worth. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3908.0s)]
*  Let's take a guess. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3912.0s)]
*  In Calculable. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3914.0s)]
*  Let's take a guess. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3915.0s)]
*  A billion a billion. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3916.0s)]
*  How much do you think he's worth Jamie. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3918.0s)]
*  Cool prices right. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3920.0s)]

*  Let's see. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3930.0s)]
*  Well those numbers are wrong. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3931.0s)]
*  How much is someone's worth. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3932.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3935.0s)]

*  Well again we're talking about like the way this gets quantified the quantification mechanism [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3945.0s)]
*  is like what's it worth. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3952.0s)]
*  What's the value of it. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3953.0s)]

*  What do you think it's worth to be the president. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3961.0s)]
*  You know that should put it into perspective. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3963.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3965.0s)]
*  Twitter's worth 44 billion. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3966.0s)]
*  What's it worth to be the president United States. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3967.0s)]
*  It's got to be worth 20. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3969.0s)]

*  Congratulations. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3977.0s)]
*  Look he was a great president. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3978.0s)]
*  I have out of all the presidents that would speak I would like to see just see him speak. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3980.0s)]
*  He was really good at giving speeches. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3985.0s)]
*  It's a fantastic statesman. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3987.0s)]
*  God whatever whether or not you know he you know I don't know who the fuck knows what [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3988.0s)]
*  it's like to be the president. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3993.0s)]
*  But as far as like a representative of the United States I think he was the best ever. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3994.0s)]
*  The best ever. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3998.0s)]
*  We've got that wonderful interview he did. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=3999.0s)]
*  I don't remember what show he was on where they asked him about UFOs and he like really [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4001.0s)]
*  did a kind of micro pause or something like you have in the UFO boards it always pops [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4006.44s)]
*  up every once in a while. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4010.96s)]
*  It's like this weird moment where he's like I can't talk about that but it's like on his [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4012.2400000000002s)]
*  face you kind of see this like thing that if you're into UFOs you're like oh fuck he's [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4015.96s)]
*  like bummed that he can't talk about it but he knows something. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4021.4s)]
*  I'm sure they know something. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4024.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't know how much the president gets to know because the problem is a guy like Trump [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4026.2400000000002s)]
*  like what would keep him from blabbing. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4031.2400000000002s)]
*  If they told him I mean he was on a show once and they asked him about UFOs too and [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4034.04s)]
*  he said something about he knows some things but he can't talk about them. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4037.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4040.36s)]
*  There's a lot of things he means in a way. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4041.36s)]
*  But just that saying that is that means they're real. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4042.36s)]
*  If you say you know some things you can't talk about them you're essentially saying [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4045.8s)]
*  they're real. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4049.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4050.24s)]
*  Because if it's like it's all nonsense wouldn't you tell the people it's all nonsense? [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4051.24s)]
*  Tell us it's nonsense sir. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4053.96s)]
*  Make me sleep well at night. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4055.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4056.64s)]
*  You're the president. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4057.64s)]
*  But if you say there's some things I know and I can't talk about them. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4058.64s)]
*  I mean we're opposed to that. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4060.88s)]
*  I think that's basically what he said. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4061.88s)]
*  Aren't we post thinking UFOs are fake now? [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4064.04s)]
*  No. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4066.84s)]
*  If you believe UFOs are bullshit you're in a minority now because you're talking about [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4067.84s)]
*  the US government has been doing like hearings where they are saying yeah some of this stuff [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4072.96s)]
*  we don't know but we've picked it up. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4079.44s)]
*  So it's the phenomena is real. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4081.56s)]
*  It's no longer just swamp gas. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4083.8s)]
*  The question is how many of them are drones? [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4086.12s)]
*  How many of them are super sophisticated drones from other countries? [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4088.84s)]
*  How many of them are drones that we have that are top secret just like the Blackbird and [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4093.04s)]
*  Stealth Bomber and all these different things they've worked on? [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4098.44s)]
*  How many of those are top secret drones? [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4101.44s)]
*  And then is there anything that's not? [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4103.84s)]
*  Like that Tic Tac one that Commander David Fravor found off the coast of San Diego in [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4107.12s)]
*  2004. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4113.08s)]
*  That's the craziest one because there's multiple jets watch this thing. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4114.08s)]
*  They got it on radar. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4117.68s)]
*  They got it. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4119.2s)]
*  They got visual. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4120.2s)]
*  They got a video of it taken off at an insane rate of speed. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4121.36s)]
*  They don't know what the fuck that thing was. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4123.88s)]
*  No visible heat signature. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4126.4s)]
*  Moving at speeds that are impossible to describe how fast it is. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4128.8s)]
*  Going from 50,000 feet to 50 in a second. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4135.139999999999s)]
*  Because that's how they said it just appeared there. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4139.599999999999s)]
*  You know because I think a radar blip is it a second? [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4142.16s)]
*  How long is the rate? [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4145.04s)]
*  Or is it like continuous now? [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4146.04s)]
*  How do they work? [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4149.0s)]
*  Is it the same way they used to work in those old movies? [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4150.0s)]
*  Remember like close encounters? [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4152.44s)]
*  You see the things in the radar. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4156.84s)]
*  It's got to be more sophisticated than that now. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4158.64s)]
*  It's looking at ripples or something. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4162.4s)]
*  There's no space in between. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4164.96s)]
*  It's just instantaneously you can see whatever the fuck it is. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4166.2s)]
*  So whatever the fuck this thing was, they tracked this. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4169.2s)]
*  And this thing moved in a way that is indescribable. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4172.04s)]
*  They can't imagine some way using the methods that we know about propulsion systems and [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4175.6s)]
*  applying it to this craft and getting it to move the way it did. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4180.4400000000005s)]
*  We've said this, I feel like we've said everything once on your podcast by now. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4183.96s)]
*  But like coral reef, some blind creature starts developing an optic nerve. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4189.120000000001s)]
*  And all of a sudden, one day after billions of years or millions of years evolution, the [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4196.240000000001s)]
*  eye opens. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4201.64s)]
*  You see the coral reef instead of just having to like sense movement in the fucking coral [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4202.68s)]
*  reef. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4206.76s)]
*  That's going to be a crazy moment for the first thing to see that when all it's been [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4207.76s)]
*  feeling are these like weird shifts in movements. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4211.56s)]
*  So probably whatever this technology is, and if you like go like Terrence McKenna and look [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4214.84s)]
*  at technology as some kind of appendage of the planet, some new sensory apparatus that's [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4220.9800000000005s)]
*  peering out of the collective, then probably we're just getting the ability to see what's [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4231.280000000001s)]
*  really out there. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4237.04s)]
*  And what's really out there is probably what people have been saying for thousands of years, [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4238.400000000001s)]
*  people who spent lifetimes meditating in the forest and went through all this weird shit. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4243.64s)]
*  And they started seeing it too. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4248.900000000001s)]
*  What's out there is innumerable forms of life and intelligence that aren't locked into the [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4250.12s)]
*  classic idea of what life looks like, carbon based life. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4257.4s)]
*  We're just starting to see the gods. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4260.92s)]
*  That's what they used to call them, the gods, angels, whatever. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4263.88s)]
*  There's devas or a jinn. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4266.92s)]
*  And that's what our technology is. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4270.679999999999s)]
*  It's starting to pick up that. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4272.24s)]
*  Yeah, enabling us to see something that's always been here. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4273.639999999999s)]
*  Always just living with us like we're going to have to deal with that. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4278.2s)]
*  Doesn't that make sense? [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4282.599999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4283.599999999999s)]
*  We've been colonized a long time ago and they just go in and out of the ocean, do as they [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4284.68s)]
*  please, move in ways that we can't track, we don't understand. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4289.280000000001s)]
*  And it wasn't until really, really recently that they even be able to use radar to detect [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4293.320000000001s)]
*  them. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4298.92s)]
*  When was the invention of radar? [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4299.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4300.92s)]
*  Was that 150 years? [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4301.92s)]
*  No idea. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4302.92s)]
*  When did they figure out radar? [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4303.92s)]
*  Imagine before radar. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4307.96s)]
*  Fucking what? [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4308.96s)]
*  Would you see? [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4309.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4310.96s)]
*  You don't have a video? [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4311.96s)]
*  There's no video yet. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4312.96s)]
*  The video didn't even start happening until the 1800s, right? [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4314.32s)]
*  So at what point in time were they supposed to have an accurate... [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4316.32s)]
*  It would be so easy to spy on us. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4320.8s)]
*  You had to carve it into a pyramid if you thought... [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4322.72s)]
*  And nobody believed you. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4325.2s)]
*  That's Mikey. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4327.88s)]
*  He's full of shit. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4328.88s)]
*  He's always talking about being visited by gods. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4329.88s)]
*  You're carving a UFO into the pyramid again? [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4331.44s)]
*  Stop it. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4335.4s)]
*  Stop riding on the pyramid. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4336.8s)]
*  When you discuss ancient civilizations and you look at the great pyramids of Egypt and [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4339.16s)]
*  all the structures of Egypt, they're so magnificent that you have to wonder, what was that society [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4344.08s)]
*  like? [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4351.28s)]
*  What was that culture like when those things were up and running? [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4352.28s)]
*  What was that like, man? [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4354.8s)]
*  Because I am... [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4357.04s)]
*  I'm absolutely not an archaeologist or a historian. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4359.8s)]
*  When I look at those structures and someone says that those things are 5,000 years old, [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4364.92s)]
*  and you think about how long ago that was, how fucking smart were those people? [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4371.0s)]
*  Very smart. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4377.12s)]
*  How did they know all that? [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4378.92s)]
*  How did they do it? [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4380.8s)]
*  What was it like living amongst them? [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4381.8s)]
*  What the fuck, man? [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4384.2s)]
*  The Great Pyrene of Giza is like 2,300,000 stones. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4385.92s)]
*  They're monstrous. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4391.280000000001s)]
*  The way it's engineered is so beyond imagination that 5,000 years ago people could do it, but [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4394.12s)]
*  obviously they did. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4400.72s)]
*  So what were they like, man? [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4401.72s)]
*  And what happened? [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4403.4s)]
*  I think it's the Graham Hancock, Randall Carlson idea. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4405.76s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4409.12s)]
*  I think that we had... [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4410.12s)]
*  Human beings had reached a very high level of sophistication, and we got fucking flatlined [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4411.44s)]
*  again by comet impacts. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4416.28s)]
*  That's the Younger Dryas Impact Theory, and it makes a fuckload of sense when you see [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4419.24s)]
*  things like the pyramids, when you see things like all these old structures, especially [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4423.64s)]
*  ones they can't really date that well. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4427.360000000001s)]
*  That's the dirty secret about that carbon dating stuff. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4430.6s)]
*  You've got to date carbon. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4433.04s)]
*  You're not going to date rocks, so you have to find organic material in between the rocks, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4434.88s)]
*  stuff that's around the rocks. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4439.4400000000005s)]
*  But you don't really know when everybody cut it. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4440.4400000000005s)]
*  You just make a really good assessment based on the carbon-based data. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4443.160000000001s)]
*  But the thing is you don't know when they cut that, when they moved that. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4448.0s)]
*  How many thousands of years did it take to set up this civilization? [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4452.78s)]
*  Where the fuck did it come from? [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4456.66s)]
*  How did they get these stones that were many tons from a quarry that was 500 miles away? [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4458.92s)]
*  How did they do that? [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4467.88s)]
*  I think that's the story of some of the stones in the King's Chamber. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4469.58s)]
*  They figured... [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4473.38s)]
*  See if this is correct. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4474.38s)]
*  I think they figured out that some of the stones in the King's Chamber were from 500 [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4475.38s)]
*  miles away. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4479.34s)]
*  The King's Chamber is the one that looks like a factory or something. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4481.0s)]
*  What is the chamber? [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4487.84s)]
*  The King's Chamber, I don't know why they call it the King's Chamber. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4488.84s)]
*  I think it might have to do with just the size of the stones and the magnificence of [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4492.48s)]
*  it. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4496.68s)]
*  Yeah, whatever the fuck that was. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4497.68s)]
*  I don't know why they call it the King's Chamber. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4499.4s)]
*  So anyway, see if you find the King's Chamber, the stones for the King's Chamber were cut [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4504.56s)]
*  from a quarry 500 miles away. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4510.4400000000005s)]
*  Google that. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4512.200000000001s)]
*  See if that's correct. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4513.200000000001s)]
*  Because I think that was one of the big mysteries. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4515.92s)]
*  How the fuck are they moving this stuff? [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4518.400000000001s)]
*  It's not even that it was right next to it and they slowly rolled it into place. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4520.52s)]
*  They took it from 500 miles away. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4524.280000000001s)]
*  Archaeologists uncovered the Skyridae. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4529.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, look at that. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4530.160000000001s)]
*  The pyramid stones were known to have been transported from over 500 miles away, but [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4531.5s)]
*  archaeologists do not agree on how the ancient Egyptians, I guess it probably says pull that [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4535.82s)]
*  off. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4540.78s)]
*  That's just the headline. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4541.78s)]
*  How the fuck could they do it? [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4543.82s)]
*  There's a new article on the construction. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4545.1s)]
*  That's from 2017. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4547.58s)]
*  That's super new. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4548.58s)]
*  But all of it is just guessing. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4549.84s)]
*  The bottom line is there's so many stones. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4551.86s)]
*  I think the numbers that have, I had a bit on it. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4555.38s)]
*  If you cut and place 10 stones a day, it's 664 years for one pyramid. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4557.22s)]
*  So they think they pulled them on ropes and pulleys and shit, but dude, they're cut so [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4563.54s)]
*  perfectly. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4568.1s)]
*  You can't get a razor blade in between them. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4569.1s)]
*  I mean, that's why it's what's funny is like we to try to understand stuff. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4570.7s)]
*  We obviously we try to use a precedent like our own technology. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4575.58s)]
*  So we use the height of our technology and then try to think about how they did it. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4579.820000000001s)]
*  If we're talking about, I mean, it's possible that we only exist, well, we exist in more [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4585.34s)]
*  than one reality. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4594.86s)]
*  Like that we're in time space right now, but there's aspects of us that are outside of [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4595.86s)]
*  time space. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4600.38s)]
*  There's aspects of us that we call our soul or whatever. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4601.38s)]
*  It's some hyperdimensional formation that like flowers with each incarnation. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4606.58s)]
*  When a flower blooms, that's your life and then it dies and another flower blooms. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4612.04s)]
*  That's your next life and another flower blooms. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4616.280000000001s)]
*  So if that's what's going on and some civilization figured that out so that instead of being [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4618.4400000000005s)]
*  unconscious about the greater whatever the fuck it is, the hyperdimensional tree that [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4625.400000000001s)]
*  we're all fruiting on, then God knows what you could do in that point. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4631.240000000001s)]
*  You could just make the tree grow a pyramid maybe. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4636.360000000001s)]
*  In the same way it grew you. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4639.68s)]
*  You could just make it like bring stones from who knows. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4642.2s)]
*  We think we're so advanced. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4646.4s)]
*  I'm sure that however cognizant a monkey is, when it's using a tool or showing its friends [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4648.44s)]
*  how to use a tool or its kids how to break open a nut or how to use the stick to get [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4659.24s)]
*  the ants out, I'm sure it's like we are very advanced. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4664.36s)]
*  This is a very advanced thing it's doing. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4669.4s)]
*  It probably thinks it's advanced if it could think that. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4671.32s)]
*  Similarly, we think we're so fucking advanced with our internet and all that stuff. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4674.12s)]
*  It just might be that we're the same way. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4678.96s)]
*  We're just putting a stick in an ants nest. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4681.599999999999s)]
*  What Jamie just pulled up there is what the pyramid originally looked like. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4684.32s)]
*  That gold capstone. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4687.12s)]
*  It had a gold capstone. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4688.12s)]
*  It was covered, I think it was in limestone. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4689.719999999999s)]
*  Is that what it was covered with? [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4693.48s)]
*  The thing I pulled up says in 1303 AD there was an earthquake that loosened up some of [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4695.48s)]
*  it and I guess that's when it took it all. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4701.24s)]
*  Then people started stealing it and they used it to build stuff. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4703.879999999999s)]
*  Of course. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4706.599999999999s)]

*  Imagine. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4709.599999999999s)]
*  They stole pieces of rock from one of the greatest constructions human beings have ever [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4710.599999999999s)]

*  Probably a toilet. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4719.28s)]
*  There's probably someone shitting in the fucking stones of the pyramid built by the great [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4720.679999999999s)]
*  masters. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4726.0s)]
*  100%. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4727.0s)]
*  Go up to the pyramid. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4728.0s)]
*  Find a stone that you like in your bidet. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4729.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4731.5599999999995s)]

*  No one's using the pyramid anymore. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4735.5599999999995s)]
*  Just grab some rocks from there. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4736.719999999999s)]
*  It's bullshit. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4738.2s)]

*  Because you can Google it and you just think even if you don't know it you think the answer [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4767.44s)]
*  is out there somewhere. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4771.72s)]
*  Sure. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=4772.72s)]

*  You can find things. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5277.08s)]
*  For some people, it's a game they play. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5278.8s)]
*  Maybe they play tennis with their friend. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5281.08s)]
*  They get together every Tuesday. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5282.68s)]
*  That fucking Tuesday, they look forward to it so much. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5283.92s)]

*  You need a break. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5290.14s)]
*  That's why those activities exist. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5291.38s)]
*  They don't exist because people are like fucking fruitless and lazy and they don't want to [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5293.320000000001s)]
*  be productive. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5297.6s)]

*  yourself in a different state of mind. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5303.6s)]
*  And whether it's hypnosis or exercise or a fucking game of chess, whatever it is, we [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5305.72s)]
*  value those things. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5310.92s)]

*  No, well, I don't know the most, but they're super fucking important. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5315.08s)]
*  And I think we think of them frivolously. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5318.360000000001s)]
*  The problem is things like video games, because video games can be insidiously addictive because [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5321.04s)]
*  in many ways they're more stimulating than real life. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5326.280000000001s)]

*  space station. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5966.32s)]
*  That's where we're headed. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5968.24s)]
*  I mean, that's proof of it, man. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5969.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, that's right now that's seems slow in the sense you have to watch it fill itself [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5970.88s)]
*  in. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5976.12s)]
*  There would probably be a selling point of some malls that are escalators are designed [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5977.12s)]
*  to enhance your AR experience. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5981.0199999999995s)]
*  So we have fully compatible AR escalator. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5983.280000000001s)]
*  So your escalator becomes a moat. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5987.84s)]
*  You have to walk across a drawbridge. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5989.52s)]
*  Think of cults in the age of AR where the cult leader gives you special, these are like [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5992.68s)]
*  our special prototypes. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=5999.360000000001s)]
*  You wear these and you will see the world as father sees it. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6001.18s)]
*  So you put them on, you know what I mean? [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6004.68s)]
*  You put them on and you're seeing like a world that is created by the cult leader. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6007.0s)]
*  Imagine, dude, fucking like a tyrannical government that like forces the citizens to wear the [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6013.120000000001s)]
*  goggles that project. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6020.04s)]
*  They live. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6021.76s)]
*  It's they live in reverse. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6022.76s)]
*  I guess. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6024.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they live. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6025.200000000001s)]
*  They live. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6026.200000000001s)]
*  Except they force you to wear the goggles. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6027.200000000001s)]
*  So if you're not wearing or like you wear goggles that are the color of whatever like [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6028.200000000001s)]
*  political party you align with. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6033.72s)]
*  So like, you know what I mean? [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6035.96s)]
*  You see somebody wearing blue goggles and you're like, oh, fuck. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6036.96s)]
*  That poor idiot. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6040.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6041.360000000001s)]
*  Stupid world they're seeing. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6043.16s)]
*  Do you know how much plastic actually gets recycled? [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6044.16s)]
*  Yeah, their goggles show carbon emissions. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6047.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6050.32s)]
*  They show the names of homeless people. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6051.32s)]
*  So they like make them human. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6053.759999999999s)]
*  Whereas like some other goggles, they just turn like homeless people into like beautiful [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6056.12s)]
*  floral displays or something. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6060.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6064.719999999999s)]
*  Like it's going to be like it's going to be like that. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6065.719999999999s)]
*  It's going to be like that. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6068.12s)]
*  You know, you want to be surrounded. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6070.04s)]
*  You want everyone that you're around to be like the most beautiful naked woman. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6072.0s)]
*  Then that's what it's going to be. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6077.28s)]
*  It's like you want that. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6078.56s)]
*  That's what you're going to get. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6079.64s)]
*  The people running these simulations and these AR, are they going to be entranced with it [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6081.2s)]
*  too? [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6087.32s)]
*  Are they going to be the people that are creating these or are we just going to give it up to [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6088.32s)]
*  AI? [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6092.4s)]
*  Like, are we going to give up to power to AI or are people going to be curating these [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6093.4s)]
*  experiences for people? [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6097.08s)]
*  Curate. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6098.36s)]
*  I mean, it's going to. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6099.36s)]
*  I think it'll be like, you know, like when I've been doing this text to art shit, you [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6100.36s)]
*  actually it takes time to figure out the right prompts to get it to make the thing you want [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6106.719999999999s)]
*  it to make. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6111.839999999999s)]
*  Like mid journey, which is this incredible text to art AI. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6112.839999999999s)]
*  You kind of part of the fun is you sit there like, you know, trying to like think of like, [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6116.16s)]
*  what is the what is it that we want this thing to make? [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6121.9s)]
*  Like and it's fun. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6125.44s)]
*  You can kind of do it like one night I was like with like Justin Roiland, a bunch of [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6128.72s)]
*  these other artists. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6134.2s)]
*  We're all trying to do different versions of like Bill Cosby eating beautiful sausages [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6135.2s)]
*  and like just trying to type in different versions of it on mid journey to like make [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6140.96s)]
*  it like like to dial in whatever the fuck. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6144.64s)]
*  Bill Cosby on a roller coaster made of human baby meat, you know, shit like that just to [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6148.280000000001s)]
*  see what you can make. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6153.6s)]
*  But you really do have to figure out the prompts. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6154.6s)]
*  So I think initially it's definitely going to be curated by people who know how to generate [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6156.44s)]
*  the prompts and make it make whatever the fuck it is. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6162.2s)]
*  But gradually it's going to get better and better at understanding what it is you're [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6165.04s)]
*  wanting. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6169.599999999999s)]
*  And then at that point, it'll probably be like, you know, you'll be more in control [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6170.86s)]
*  of what you're seeing on your screen at first and then in VR and then in AR, I would say. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6174.759999999999s)]
*  And then who knows? [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6179.4s)]
*  Who knows, man? [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6180.4s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure there's like going to be popular, like in the way there's popular Instagram [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6181.4s)]
*  videos. Right. Right. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6185.32s)]
*  There's going to be popular worlds where you upload your world experience to some new [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6186.679999999999s)]
*  version of Instagram and, you know, or TikTok or whatever. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6192.24s)]
*  It's like, oh, yeah, I'm going to try. I'm going to put on that dude's fucking world [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6195.84s)]
*  experience. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6198.599999999999s)]
*  It's awesome. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6199.599999999999s)]
*  You know, it probably will be more like that curated VR or AR world experiences. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6201.28s)]
*  There'll be people who are really good at making them. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6208.08s)]
*  And then, you know, there's going to be people who are like, you know, become like the Steven [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6210.5599999999995s)]
*  Spielberg of augmented reality, like reality replacement. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6215.92s)]
*  But wouldn't the curated shit become like the NBC, CBS, ABC version? [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6220.16s)]
*  And then there's going to be a block chain version of AI where everybody agrees to have [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6225.32s)]
*  no centralized power and it just all gets created and curated and adjusted by the people [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6230.5599999999995s)]
*  that work inside the system. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6237.5599999999995s)]
*  That's the forum. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6239.24s)]
*  Dude, when I was, I was, you know what I'm saying? [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6241.16s)]
*  Like that would like eliminate cults. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6243.4s)]
*  That's stability AI, dude. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6245.5599999999995s)]
*  That's the people making this shit. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6247.12s)]
*  I'm like they are like I couldn't find who made it. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6248.759999999999s)]
*  I had to like dig deep just to find who was like making this technology available. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6252.2s)]
*  I couldn't find it because they're making it open source and their whole thing is what [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6257.679999999999s)]
*  you're talking about. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6261.5199999999995s)]
*  It's all collaborative. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6262.36s)]
*  AI by the people for the people. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6264.44s)]
*  Yeah, dude. Yeah. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6265.679999999999s)]
*  And it was hard to find like this technology is the most mind blowing shit out there and [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6267.5199999999995s)]
*  it was hard to find who's behind it. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6272.599999999999s)]
*  That might be this concept behind this and the idea behind that. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6274.879999999999s)]
*  That might be the cure. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6279.12s)]
*  If this is the way that humanity interacts and exchange information from here on out, [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6281.839999999999s)]
*  imagine if that becomes the norm. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6287.44s)]
*  That could be the norm. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6289.44s)]
*  And if that's the norm, that might be our way out of this. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6290.44s)]
*  If there's a way where you can get out of centralized power and the way is that it's [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6293.28s)]
*  almost impossible to avoid just like it's impossible to not have a cell phone now. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6297.8s)]
*  You know, it's impossible. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6302.32s)]
*  I mean, you can do it. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6303.32s)]
*  People have done it. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6304.92s)]
*  Some people wear flip phones. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6305.92s)]
*  You can be a renegade. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6306.92s)]
*  But most people don't. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6309.04s)]
*  What if it becomes like that with this? [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6311.2s)]
*  And what if it becomes like that with decentralized AI? [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6313.36s)]
*  And if we all agree that this is the best way to and there's no manipulation, there's [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6316.8s)]
*  no coercion for you to opt in to a corporate controlled AI. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6321.54s)]
*  Right. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6325.5s)]
*  Like, why would I do that? [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6326.5s)]
*  I don't want to do that. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6327.5s)]
*  I'm going to why would I only watch the Big Bang Theory when I want to watch Game of Thrones? [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6328.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6333.02s)]
*  I watch Game of Thrones. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6334.02s)]
*  Fuck you. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6335.02s)]
*  And it's going to be like that with the way you interact with reality. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6336.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6338.42s)]
*  People are going to gravitate towards these ones that aren't controlled. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6339.42s)]
*  There'll be a bunch of fake ones that are controlled by Russia. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6341.82s)]
*  Right. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6344.22s)]
*  When people get sucked into these ones and those ones be manipulative. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6345.22s)]
*  But I think ultimately, just like what the internet is doing for the exchange of information, [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6348.74s)]
*  it's kind of like putting it in the hands of people that really never would have gotten [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6354.0199999999995s)]

*  Right. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6360.58s)]
*  Maybe it'll be like that with AI as well. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6361.58s)]
*  I mean, this stuff is most certainly being like at least, you know, that stuff is open [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6363.58s)]
*  source. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6368.3s)]
*  When you are working with it, you like it's like, man, I'm telling you, it's like wizard. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6370.139999999999s)]
*  It's like going into a wizard's library or something. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6375.86s)]
*  You're having to like pull out these weird tomes called collabs, these weird things on [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6379.1s)]
*  GitHub like shit. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6383.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6385.26s)]
*  It's so fucking arcane. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6386.26s)]
*  And like, you know, like going on YouTube channels like profit of the singularity to [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6387.42s)]
*  like the name of the YouTube channels, profit of the singularity to get tutorials on how [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6393.5s)]
*  to make the shit work. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6398.3s)]
*  And it's all just people sharing information. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6399.9s)]
*  That's what I love about it. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6402.42s)]
*  Just people like, okay, I figured out how to do this. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6403.5s)]
*  And then I figured out how to do that. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6406.2s)]
*  It's all going on in the background, just like what you were saying earlier. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6408.219999999999s)]
*  While we're all at each other's fucking throats, the midterm elections are coming and the fate [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6410.74s)]
*  of democracy lies in your vote. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6415.9s)]
*  In the background, these, I don't know who they are, wizard, transhumanist, AI people [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6418.62s)]
*  are just tapping code. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6426.259999999999s)]
*  Okay, we're going to make the AI smarter. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6428.219999999999s)]
*  We're going to make it a little smarter. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6431.38s)]
*  I think you made it smarter here. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6432.58s)]
*  Let's make it smarter there. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6434.259999999999s)]
*  Can we make it understand language better? [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6435.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we can. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6437.139999999999s)]
*  Let's see if we can make it translate really bad audio into perfectly clear speech. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6438.139999999999s)]
*  Okay, we can do that. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6441.94s)]
*  Let's just keep doing. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6442.94s)]
*  All that's going on in the background. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6443.94s)]
*  And where it gets interesting is like, they're sharing their information. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6445.299999999999s)]
*  Here you go. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6448.66s)]
*  We figured it out. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6449.66s)]
*  Here you go. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6450.66s)]
*  And then some other wizard gets it and they're like, okay, I can make that better. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6451.66s)]
*  And then it gets a little better and a little better. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6453.339999999999s)]
*  And then the AI starts making it better on its own. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6454.78s)]
*  It's like, all right, maybe I'll analyze this, the things my master's created. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6457.7s)]
*  And then let's see if I can make myself better. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6460.78s)]
*  That's how you get to McKenna's singularity. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6463.5s)]
*  Open source collaboration between these geniuses. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6466.74s)]
*  And they don't honestly, I don't think they give a fuck who it is working on it. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6470.1s)]
*  Like anybody can like participate. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6474.18s)]
*  It's really cool, man. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6477.3s)]

*  We talked about Paul Saladino sent me some data on seed oils. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6526.7s)]
*  And they're connecting seed oils and consumption of seed oils, [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6532.86s)]
*  which is in fucking everything, to macular degeneration, [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6535.179999999999s)]
*  to some some people's vision issues. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6538.82s)]

*  These things are bad for you. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6683.7s)]
*  They cause inflammation. Olive oil is actually good for you. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6685.18s)]
*  Dude, can you believe that shit? [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6687.7s)]
*  Like all those things they just listed are poison killing you. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6690.18s)]
*  And like no one really like understands that. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6695.46s)]
*  Like it's making you go blind. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6698.54s)]
*  Well, they didn't know when they first started selling them. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6700.18s)]
*  You know, so the problem is they're already selling them. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6702.86s)]
*  Like when they they used to think that saturated fat like butter was the culprit [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6704.78s)]
*  and that, you know, you know, the study about the sugar study [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6709.38s)]
*  where they paid scientists off to say that sugar was causing all these heart issues. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6712.02s)]
*  When when they did that, they created a narrative [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6718.3s)]
*  that everybody sort of bought into. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6721.74s)]
*  And that narrative is you want to get away from saturated fat. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6723.66s)]
*  So what's the what's the substitute? [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6726.94s)]
*  Oh, well, you get these vegetable oils. Perfect. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6728.5s)]
*  Vegetables are good for you. Right. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6730.46s)]
*  Vegetables are good for you. Right. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6732.099999999999s)]
*  So if you will, vegetable oil must be better for you. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6733.22s)]
*  Makes sense. Right. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6734.98s)]
*  But then you find out about the processing involved and the oxidation that it's [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6735.7s)]
*  they're damaged and that it causes inflammation. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6740.42s)]
*  And, dude, I feel like shit when I have a salad [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6742.66s)]
*  and it's got like some shitty salad dressing on it. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6745.3s)]
*  It's always like, oh, my stomach feels gross. Yeah, right. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6747.3s)]
*  But when I have a salad with like olive oil and like balsamic vinaigrette, [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6750.18s)]
*  it's fucking great. I love it. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6753.3s)]
*  Like I used to think that I didn't like eating salads. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6755.5s)]
*  That made me feel gross. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6758.5s)]
*  And I realized, no, it's the fucking dressing because I'm a dope. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6759.74s)]
*  And if I had like a nice Italian dressing, a zesty, I'll pour that shit all. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6763.5s)]
*  It's like you're pouring all these weird fucking oils all over your food. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6767.06s)]
*  Oh, dude, that's so fucked up, man. Like we all do it, though. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6771.22s)]
*  It's like, oh, my God, you see, you know, this dressing, I will fucking dump it. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6775.3s)]
*  I'll I'll turn my salad into a soup. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6779.54s)]
*  But you're being a good boy. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6782.7s)]
*  It's good. I'm eating my veggies. Super healthy. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6784.1s)]
*  Holy shit. But meanwhile, it's not. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6787.18s)]
*  And then you get all puffed. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6788.62s)]
*  But if you do it with olive oil, it is healthy. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6789.9800000000005s)]
*  That's the rub. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6793.02s)]
*  And I think a lot of like what these people are connecting, [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6794.3s)]
*  like a lot of these people are talking about, like damages that vegetables do to you. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6796.66s)]
*  Maybe maybe it's what you're putting on them, too. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6800.54s)]
*  It could be that. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6803.58s)]
*  I mean, how many people are cooking their vegetables in these [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6804.3s)]
*  these kind of oils? A lot of people, man. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6807.66s)]
*  A lot of oil and they think they're doing it. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6810.5s)]
*  No, lard is different. Lard is OK. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6812.5s)]
*  Rendered fat. Yeah, that's what beef tallow is. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6814.42s)]
*  It's rendered fat. Good news. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6817.42s)]
*  Yeah. Rendered fat is actually good for you, [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6819.58s)]
*  which is crazy because you would say there's no way. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6822.26s)]
*  But actually, that's like that's a fat that tolerates high heat better. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6824.74s)]
*  It's it doesn't you know, when you're cooking in high heat, you want lard. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6828.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's good for you. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6832.58s)]
*  Beef tallow is very good for it's just beef fat. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6833.58s)]
*  But like Crisco, not good for you. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6836.54s)]
*  Is that lard in there, though? [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6838.94s)]
*  What's in Crisco? Crisco is lard. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6840.38s)]
*  Well, if lard means I think the old school old timey method, [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6842.18s)]
*  that's what I'm using, not processed lard. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6845.78s)]
*  I'm using like rendered pig fat. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6847.7s)]
*  These dudes rendered bear fat. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6850.38s)]
*  Bear fat was like super popular for a long time in this country. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6851.9800000000005s)]
*  Bears were very valued for their fat, believe it or not. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6855.34s)]
*  I believe it. And then there's beef tallow. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6858.58s)]
*  OK, so this is Crisco vegetable oil. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6860.3s)]
*  Oh, shit. Originally cottonseed oil. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6863.7s)]
*  I don't eat it. I just for some reason thought that was lard. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6866.06s)]
*  I it sounds like it's lard. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6869.219999999999s)]
*  That's why. But see, that's not good for you. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6870.7s)]
*  Look what it says on it. All vegetable. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6873.46s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, it must be good for you. All vegetable. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6875.58s)]
*  It's got to be good for you. Like eating broccoli. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6877.82s)]
*  So we got duped by these fucking scientists and whatever. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6879.86s)]
*  Was it like the 50s or 60s? Whenever they did that, [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6883.0199999999995s)]
*  they pay these guys like 50 grand. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6886.139999999999s)]
*  It wasn't even a lot of money. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6888.3s)]
*  And they fucked up our entire food pyramid. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6889.7s)]
*  They screwed up people's ideas of what's healthy and what's not healthy. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6892.9s)]
*  And they did it for fucking being bribed. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6896.46s)]
*  Well, by the sugar industry. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6899.54s)]
*  How many other things? [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6900.860000000001s)]
*  Oh, but that's a nutty one, dude, because it still persists to this day. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6902.42s)]
*  When you tell people that you only eat mostly meat. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6905.78s)]
*  Yeah. 50 years ago, sugar industry quietly paid scientists [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6908.66s)]
*  to point the blame to fat. Wow. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6911.58s)]
*  I mean, it is a bonkers story. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6914.58s)]
*  So there was a rise, I think. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6917.9800000000005s)]
*  And what was it? [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6920.54s)]
*  Arterial sclerosis, what was the rise in specifically? [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6922.9800000000005s)]
*  There was like some sort of a health epidemic, [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6926.820000000001s)]
*  very heart disease, coronary heart disease. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6930.14s)]
*  So this coronary heart disease rise started happening. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6932.14s)]
*  People were getting fatter and they were having heart attacks. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6934.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And so they were like, we got to figure out a way [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6937.18s)]
*  to not kill this fucking gravy chamber on. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6940.860000000001s)]
*  We're on this. They had these internal documents that were clearly [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6943.900000000001s)]
*  pointing to sugar being fucking terrible for you. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6947.22s)]
*  So they bribe scientists. I can't believe that. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6949.78s)]
*  It's amazing. I you know, are we just, you know, [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6952.62s)]
*  idiots? No, we just naive idiots that we are like astounded [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6956.42s)]
*  that humans could be that fucking evil to to to [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6960.5s)]
*  to warp reality in a way to poison people for money. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6965.66s)]
*  Like to me, it's crazy to me. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6970.34s)]
*  Absolutely still happening right now. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6973.42s)]
*  That's that's where we get hacked. Right. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6975.18s)]
*  Yeah. That's where the hacking happens, because we want to feel safe. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6978.74s)]
*  You want to believe. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6983.1s)]
*  I believe we got it figured out now. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6984.82s)]
*  And you want to believe that that there aren't people like that. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6986.46s)]
*  Literal warlocks, like literal evil wizards [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=6990.0199999999995s)]

*  Well, we'll go even further than that. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7002.58s)]
*  What people are capable of fentanyl. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7005.099999999999s)]

*  I mean, fentanyl is scary. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7024.98s)]

*  Some of it is like these little brightly colored pills. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7071.86s)]
*  And if you're a kid and you're four [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7075.54s)]
*  and you see that, that looks like candy. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7079.86s)]
*  You're just going to take it and put in your mouth. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7082.42s)]
*  Kids put everything in their mouth. You know that. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7083.66s)]
*  They stuck things up their nose. Yeah, dude. Yeah. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7085.179999999999s)]
*  That's what they do. So that's laying around. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7087.78s)]
*  That's a concern. That's a real concern. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7089.86s)]
*  Is it a concern that people are going to like come across the border [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7092.38s)]
*  and give kids poison candy? [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7095.139999999999s)]
*  No, I don't think that's the concern. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7097.94s)]
*  But to make light of this idea [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7099.74s)]
*  that the fentanyl issue is not a giant, terrifying issue [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7102.82s)]
*  that's killing somewhere like 100000 people [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7107.62s)]
*  of are dying of this drug every day. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7110.9s)]
*  And there was is there some dispute about [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7113.74s)]
*  that it's the number one killer of kids 18 to 45? [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7117.179999999999s)]
*  I mean, dude, it's in all the drugs. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7121.26s)]
*  You said there was like some dispute, right? [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7123.099999999999s)]
*  Looking it up, it was the number one killer. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7124.62s)]
*  And like most people, it was like cancer and heart disease. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7127.22s)]
*  The number one killer of all people. Yeah. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7131.660000000001s)]
*  That includes 18 to 49. Correct. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7133.900000000001s)]
*  So what is that? [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7136.780000000001s)]
*  And then that's why it was digging into the article. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7138.38s)]
*  It was like blaming it on fentanyl was a little tough. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7140.62s)]
*  Not that it was necessarily inaccurate, but it's not. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7143.34s)]
*  No one's keeping track of fentanyl deaths. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7145.860000000001s)]
*  They don't even write it on a, I think, the death certificate that way. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7147.740000000001s)]
*  It's just opiate. Yeah. OK. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7151.46s)]
*  So let's just say opioid deaths. Let's not even say fentanyl. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7153.06s)]
*  I think that was what they were saying. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7156.58s)]
*  I don't necessarily they were saying it was all fentanyl poisoning. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7158.139999999999s)]
*  But, you know, fentanyl is just the most potent form of opiate. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7161.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So what's the number one opioid? [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7164.34s)]
*  Is that the number one killer of people 18 to 49? [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7167.34s)]
*  Heroin would be. But is it? [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7169.66s)]
*  But what I'm saying is, if if it's not fentanyl, that's the number one killer. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7170.94s)]
*  Is it opioids that are the number one killer of people 18 to 49? [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7174.179999999999s)]
*  Isn't fentanyl cheaper than heroin? That's the problem. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7176.94s)]
*  Well, it's way more potent. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7179.179999999999s)]
*  If you could do a tiny, tiny, tiny amount, it can kill you. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7180.54s)]
*  Like if you look at it in relationship to a penny, [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7183.7s)]
*  it's like the tiniest part of a penny. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7187.0199999999995s)]
*  You know, the PolitiFact says heart disease, cancer and COVID [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7188.7s)]
*  outrank opioid overdoses as leading causes of death among all American adults. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7192.22s)]
*  Right. The problem with COVID is if you are dying of opioids and you catch COVID [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7197.0599999999995s)]
*  and then you die from COVID, that's a COVID death. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7202.18s)]
*  You know, it's funny, dude. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7204.74s)]
*  You're so many people listen to your fucking podcast. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7205.78s)]
*  There's probably someone making fentanyl right now, listening to this shit. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7208.34s)]
*  Like, come on, it's not that bad. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7212.06s)]
*  A study by an advocacy group says that fentanyl is the leading cause of death [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7214.26s)]
*  for people ages 18 to 45 compared with other major causes of death, [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7218.780000000001s)]
*  such as automobile accidents, cancer and suicide. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7222.580000000001s)]
*  Heart disease, cancer and COVID-19 outrank [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7226.38s)]
*  outrank opioid overdoses as leading causes of death among all American adults. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7229.860000000001s)]
*  I wonder, though, we do. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7235.38s)]
*  And I'm not discrediting the fact that people died from COVID, [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7237.46s)]
*  but we do know that a lot of people who died from COVID were already dying [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7239.86s)]
*  and they listed them as COVID deaths, including people with cancer. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7243.46s)]
*  If you're taking opioids and your immune system is fucking destroyed [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7246.46s)]
*  and you're on your way out the door and you catch COVID, [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7251.82s)]
*  you're probably not going to make it. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7254.54s)]
*  Did COVID kill you or were you already dying? [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7255.94s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, dude, I don't. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7258.86s)]
*  So what's the what's the actual number then? [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7261.0199999999995s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Like if you if you found that number and you tacked it on. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7263.339999999999s)]
*  Wait, didn't Jamie scroll up, didn't it say 100000 people a year? [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7266.9800000000005s)]
*  That was a quote someone had. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7271.42s)]
*  So right there, it said 56000. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7273.5s)]
*  Yeah. So it said there it said 2020, more than 56000 people. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7275.7s)]
*  But that is two years ago and it has gotten worse. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7281.26s)]
*  2021 nearly 70 million. 70,000. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7283.5s)]
*  So CDC's online mortality database, 2021, [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7288.66s)]
*  nearly 70000 people, 18 and older died. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7292.9800000000005s)]
*  So that is shy of 100, but still fucking crazy. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7296.179999999999s)]
*  Dude, that makes Jonestown look like nothing. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7301.66s)]
*  That's a large number of people. Think of that, man. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7304.099999999999s)]
*  Think of that like if we could see like all those dead bodies, [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7306.139999999999s)]
*  like, you know, the videos of Jonestown when they're all scattered around. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7310.339999999999s)]
*  Just imagine a Super Bowl. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7313.139999999999s)]
*  It's a super stadium filled with dead people. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7314.7s)]
*  Yeah. In a year. Every year. Every year. From overdose. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7318.179999999999s)]
*  Holy fuck, man. Yeah. That is crazy. That's crazy. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7321.379999999999s)]
*  That's a way to look at it that really puts it in perspective. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7325.46s)]
*  God damn, that shit must feel good. I've never done it, man. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7327.7s)]
*  It must just be like it must be the it must be an incredible. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7330.7s)]
*  Well, I think it's just it's probably amazing. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7334.74s)]
*  But there's also the problem that they give it to you when you get hurt. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7337.62s)]
*  And so it's hard to get off of. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7341.98s)]
*  I know a bunch of people that have gotten injured and then they got on something. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7344.139999999999s)]
*  And then whatever that painkiller was, they had a really hard time getting off. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7348.42s)]
*  Dude, I flirted with that shit for a second. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7351.7s)]
*  And then something changed in my brain. I used to like it. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7353.66s)]
*  I used to like taking like a Vicodin and like I like the buzz. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7356.3s)]
*  But then it's the weirdest thing, man. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7360.54s)]
*  Just one day. It had been a long time since I'd taken any of them. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7362.82s)]
*  I took it and I just got really sick. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7365.62s)]
*  Like, like made me feel like woozy. I didn't like the high at all. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7368.22s)]
*  I just got lucky. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7371.9s)]
*  But some people, yeah, man, they take it. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7373.139999999999s)]
*  And they're like, I've come home. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7376.34s)]
*  This is home. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7378.9s)]
*  This is where I want to be. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7380.1s)]
*  This is, you know, like it's it's like warming your hands on a chemical fire. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7381.860000000001s)]
*  Remember the old Nyquil, the one that really got you fucked up? Oh, yeah. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7387.780000000001s)]
*  I remember I took that old Nyquil in the 90s and I was sick one day and I took it [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7391.780000000001s)]
*  and I was sitting in my bed watching TV and I couldn't have felt more loved. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7396.42s)]
*  Yeah, I was like the whole world is just full of love. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7401.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's love, love, love. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7405.06s)]
*  I was like, oh, no wonder why people love this stuff. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7407.1s)]
*  Yeah, like I didn't know that it was that you could buy over the counter. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7409.9s)]
*  What is it? Was it codeine? Is that what it was? [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7414.299999999999s)]
*  I think it was codeine. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7416.5s)]
*  Dude, it felt magical. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7418.259999999999s)]
*  I don't know if it was a Nyquil, though. Codeine was a Nyquil. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7419.86s)]
*  Whatever it was that I took, some nasty stuff that you take a shot of. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7422.66s)]
*  I thought it was Nyquil. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7426.34s)]
*  Probably like some cough syrup, some kind of like cough syrup [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7427.259999999999s)]
*  that had codeine in it, because I do know that was over the I think it was over [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7430.46s)]
*  the counter at one point in time was Nyquil. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7433.42s)]
*  Did Nyquil have codeine or something like that? [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7435.66s)]
*  Nyquil had some shit definitely that would make you kind of trip. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7438.42s)]
*  But what you're describing sounds like an opioid or something. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7442.46s)]
*  It felt like that. It felt just like pure love. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7446.82s)]
*  Like I remember feeling how good it felt to the rest of my head on the pillow. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7450.26s)]
*  It was like, oh, it was wonderful. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7455.02s)]
*  And I was like, oh, my God, this stuff is great. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7458.66s)]
*  I was like, keep this shit away from me. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7460.66s)]
*  Yeah, I have the kind of self-control to not be tricking Nyquil every night. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7462.74s)]
*  Dude, that would be so weird if you were secretly addicted to Nyquil. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7466.26s)]
*  Well, I know people who have been. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7469.54s)]
*  I know there was a comedy. Nyquil? [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7471.66s)]
*  Yeah, there's a comic used to make the staff [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7473.74s)]

*  That's so weird. It's not weird, man. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7483.06s)]
*  I'm telling you, if you experience I don't know. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7485.38s)]
*  I mean, what year was it? [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7487.66s)]
*  I want to say it was when I got sick that I had the Nyquil. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7489.66s)]
*  I want to say it was late 90s. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7492.5s)]
*  Wasn't it a TikTok thing that just happened [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7493.7s)]
*  where their kids were cooking chicken and Nyquil? [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7495.78s)]
*  And like they had to say to stop doing that. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7499.0199999999995s)]
*  Like they had to say you get the island boys. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7501.42s)]
*  Parents, be more careful. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7510.54s)]
*  Kind of food you're cooking your kids. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7512.74s)]
*  Nobody was. I don't think anyone was eating the chicken and the Nyquil. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7514.38s)]
*  It was just I think some weirdo poured Nyquil in a frying pan [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7517.74s)]
*  and threw chicken in it. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7520.98s)]
*  And then it set off like a TikTok challenge. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7522.259999999999s)]
*  And then, of course, someone eventually like, [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7525.5s)]
*  what happens when we eat the chicken? [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7527.02s)]
*  Tell me that's not China. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7528.34s)]
*  Tell me that is not China fucking with America. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7529.82s)]
*  That's where you need the Ministry of Truth to stop the Nyquil chicken crazes. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7532.1s)]
*  You hire this dude who's like, you know, the acting world's [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7536.3s)]
*  not really working out that well for him. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7539.5s)]
*  But we have a job for you in China to do disinformation videos. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7540.94s)]
*  How to handle risky internet trends like TikTok's Nyquil chicken challenge. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7544.94s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7549.06s)]
*  They really cooked Nyquil cooked chicken and Nyquil. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7550.3s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not surprised. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7553.42s)]
*  These kids are fucking crazy. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7556.26s)]
*  Is it when what year did Nyquil have something psychoactive in it? [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7558.740000000001s)]
*  And did it change? [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7562.700000000001s)]
*  It used to have up to 25 percent alcohol at least. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7563.58s)]
*  And it looks like the in 1991 around the time is maybe when it changed. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7567.700000000001s)]
*  What did it change it to? [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7572.62s)]
*  I'm looking like a because no one my dumb ass. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7573.9800000000005s)]
*  I might have had a jug sitting around from 91. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7576.9400000000005s)]
*  Very long about it. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7579.9400000000005s)]
*  A long article about the whole timeline of like every year of Nyquil [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7581.7s)]
*  and how popular it was and all the ads about it. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7585.98s)]
*  And I think it's changed multiple times. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7588.5s)]
*  What I find, like I didn't say there was codeine in it specifically, but [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7591.58s)]
*  Nyquil tastes like shit, man. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7595.099999999999s)]
*  I don't understand. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7596.7s)]
*  Truly like it's so good. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7598.38s)]
*  You do. This was one time when I was sick and I didn't experience this ever again. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7600.099999999999s)]
*  And there was one other time where I was on morphine when I got my knee [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7604.9s)]
*  reconstructed, they had a morphine drip on me. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7607.98s)]
*  And I am pretty positive. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7611.06s)]
*  They told me that when I press the button, you would get more morphine [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7615.26s)]
*  because it's like connected to this thing. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7618.74s)]
*  Wow. And then if you felt bad, you could press the button and get more. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7620.18s)]
*  So I was hammering that fucking thing. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7623.42s)]
*  But someone told me it's regulated. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7625.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, like they just give you the impression you're in control of it. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7628.14s)]
*  Yeah, but I'm like in 93. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7631.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean, you would in 1993, they're not going to let you dial in your own morphine [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7633.98s)]
*  because the more morphine you get, the higher you get. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7637.46s)]
*  And then you forget like you're like, when did I press the button last? [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7639.42s)]
*  It's probably been 20 minutes. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7642.9800000000005s)]
*  It's been a couple of seconds. That's how you OD. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7644.38s)]
*  That's how people OD is they get high and they forget they took the pill [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7646.9800000000005s)]
*  and then they go back and take the pill. Right. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7650.9s)]
*  But what if it only gives you like one milligram of a hammer? [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7652.78s)]
*  Yeah. Stroboscopic. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7655.58s)]
*  And wait, it's like 300 milligrams will kill you. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7657.42s)]
*  Yeah. 300 easy clicks to paradise. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7660.38s)]
*  Do you know what Peter Rettia told me about Tylenol? [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7664.38s)]
*  He said, if you take 20 times the recommended dose, it'll kill you. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7666.5s)]
*  That's how dangerous Tylenol is. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7671.18s)]
*  Is C. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7673.06s)]
*  de Minofin, he said, is C. de Minofin poisoning is like a very high rate of poisoning. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7673.3s)]
*  I heard that's the kind of people that don't want to read the labels. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7677.82s)]
*  You go to the hospital. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7680.46s)]
*  You've decided to commit suicide with Tylenol. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7682.38s)]
*  You've changed your mind. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7686.14s)]
*  Oh, my God. You go there thinking you're going to get like something. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7687.9400000000005s)]
*  They're going to give you something to make you better. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7690.9800000000005s)]
*  And they're like, your liver's gone. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7692.66s)]
*  Like it's already eaten your liver up or something. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7694.02s)]
*  I don't know if this is just like some horror story I heard, [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7696.540000000001s)]
*  but I heard that's how it works is once you're going to be alive a little bit, [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7699.42s)]
*  you're going to survive a little bit longer than after your liver is [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7704.26s)]
*  like kind of liquefied or something. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7707.700000000001s)]
*  And then so it's a terrible O.D. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7709.700000000001s)]
*  It's a terrible O.D. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7711.900000000001s)]
*  Fuck that. C. de Minofin eats you up. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7712.9400000000005s)]
*  That's why Vicodin is so bad, because it's the C. de Minofin mixed with the opioid. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7716.02s)]
*  And it goes really well with. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7720.34s)]
*  What wine? Red. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7723.66s)]

*  I know people that have had problems with Xanax, especially like mixing Xanax. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7766.820000000001s)]

*  I went on tour in Australia. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7787.0199999999995s)]
*  My dad had given me these sleeping pills [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7788.98s)]
*  that were the best fucking sleeping pills of all time, Joe. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7792.66s)]
*  And I'm so dumb, I didn't look in what was in it, you know, and then Xanax. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7795.62s)]
*  There was a Benzo on it. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7800.099999999999s)]
*  Now, someone else had given me Benzo's. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7801.3s)]
*  Anyway, the point is, like, I didn't realize how many Benzo's I was taking. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7804.54s)]
*  So I get to take them every night to go to sleep and before a flight. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7808.740000000001s)]

*  So I stopped taking it. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7829.5s)]
*  I'm standing in line at a pharmacy not to get more Xanax, to get cold. No. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=7830.62s)]

*  The family unit is so crazy. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8022.74s)]
*  You can only compare it to demon possession. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8025.78s)]
*  It's like this used to be your brother. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8028.02s)]
*  This used to be your son. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8031.74s)]

*  They lied about it being addictive. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8100.82s)]

*  What? [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8211.9s)]
*  That his manager had him whacked because he was going to leave his manager [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8212.82s)]
*  like some guy who was like a security guy or something that wrote a book about it. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8216.02s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8219.619999999999s)]
*  And it's there's a lot of weird stuff to it. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8220.46s)]
*  Like Hendrix is a girl afterwards, threw herself off a roof. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8222.3s)]
*  And they were trying to say that they silenced her. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8227.5s)]
*  They took her to a fucking roof and threw her off of it. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8229.86s)]
*  They put in there, you know, that that that's very it's right. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8233.86s)]
*  I don't know the story. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8237.82s)]
*  I don't know whether it's correct or not. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8238.94s)]
*  I used to say, oh, I bet that's what happened. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8240.5s)]
*  But now I'm like, who the fuck knows? [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8242.66s)]
*  But for sure, organized crime was involved in music. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8244.9s)]
*  For sure. Yeah, right. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8249.06s)]
*  Why would they not be? They were involved in everything. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8250.74s)]
*  Yeah. The mob back in the day was involved in any fucking thing that was profitable. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8252.42s)]
*  You know, I think one of the coolest things the mob has done lately [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8256.98s)]
*  is gotten people to go the mob back in the day. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8260.86s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8263.86s)]
*  Like they've they're so smart because they're like, oh, yeah, let's they say [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8264.5s)]
*  they got a PR person out there like, yeah, back in the day, [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8267.78s)]
*  the mob was doing all kinds of crazy stuff. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8271.02s)]
*  But the mob, it's mostly gone now. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8273.699999999999s)]
*  There's no more mob. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8275.699999999999s)]
*  It's really cool. Like, it's a smart move they did. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8277.06s)]
*  I like that. It's like when Vince in the chin, you know, he used to walk around [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8279.3s)]
*  New York City with like a bathrobe on. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8283.14s)]
*  Yeah. Slippers and that crazy. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8286.46s)]
*  Yeah. And meanwhile, he was like, giving everybody information. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8288.619999999999s)]
*  Come walk with me. We're going to walk. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8290.74s)]
*  This is what we're going to do. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8291.94s)]
*  The fucking Malingatis, they think they got us on this. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8292.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah. We're going to take them out at the fucking knees. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8294.82s)]
*  This is how we're going to do it. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8296.58s)]
*  So he's laying out what needs to be done. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8297.58s)]
*  Managing all the business of all the families. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8300.619999999999s)]
*  And along the way, the FBI bugged the cars. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8303.46s)]
*  So they knew his route that he would take. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8307.779999999999s)]
*  And so they just bugged the hubcaps of all these cars. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8310.58s)]
*  They parked a bunch of cars there. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8312.859999999999s)]
*  I think that's the story that's connected to that. Right. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8314.74s)]
*  Isn't that how they got him? [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8316.82s)]
*  Or am I conflating two mob stories? [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8317.9s)]
*  They might have used that on more than one mobster, that technique. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8319.939999999999s)]
*  But that's how they got him. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8322.699999999999s)]
*  Guy was just acting crazy. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8323.619999999999s)]
*  Dude, it's so funny to me, like when you know, the thing is like, [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8324.74s)]
*  again, I don't mean to be cynical. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8329.060000000001s)]
*  I mean, I I'm an old man, old man now. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8330.460000000001s)]
*  I'm older now. And I like I have gotten to the point where I recognize that [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8333.34s)]
*  the government isn't evil. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8337.74s)]
*  The guy it's like it's trying to do something. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8339.820000000002s)]
*  And that thing it's trying to do is really fucking hard. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8342.900000000001s)]
*  Like it's trying to create a democracy, a place where you could like raise your kids, [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8345.1s)]
*  not have kids, whatever, but live a relatively free life. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8349.54s)]
*  Be healthy, happy. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8352.78s)]
*  It's trying to do that. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8354.220000000001s)]
*  That's the machine is trying to do that. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8355.18s)]
*  And it's failing a lot is trying. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8356.82s)]
*  But but but it gets it's gotten infiltrated. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8359.3s)]
*  So within it, there's chunks of like really nefarious bad shit. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8362.539999999999s)]
*  But it's like at some point you look at like the wars between governments and [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8367.22s)]
*  like mob mafia organized crime. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8372.34s)]
*  And it's like, really, what's the like which one? [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8375.9s)]
*  Like they're both resorting to really brutal tactics. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8379.5s)]
*  Yeah, they both are OK with killing people. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8382.14s)]
*  They both wage war like, [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8384.619999999999s)]
*  I mean, like strategically, when you look at it, like if you took the, [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8388.3s)]
*  you know, you take like any classic. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8392.939999999999s)]
*  Drug dealer like any like mid-level drug dealer, [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8395.9s)]
*  make them like five hundred times more powerful and they become a pharmaceutical company. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8399.14s)]
*  Right. Like at some point you go from like selling illegal drugs to just starting a company [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8405.14s)]
*  making fentadel and then legally selling synthetic hair when it being protected by the police [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8410.62s)]
*  while you sell the drugs. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8416.66s)]
*  That's the only difference. Right. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8418.26s)]
*  Like if like the idea is like you get organized crime, the organized crime, [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8419.34s)]
*  if it gets to a certain level, it gets on the radar and then it gets shut down. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8424.460000000001s)]
*  But if it manages to like jump through that level, [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8428.98s)]
*  then usually it just gets into politics. Right. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8432.82s)]
*  And then it just becomes part of the government. Right. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8435.26s)]
*  Like that's the ultimate place you want to be. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8437.58s)]
*  Like you want to go from succumbing to laws to controlling the laws. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8439.38s)]
*  That's like victory. Right. When you get to make the laws. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8444.14s)]
*  So, I don't know. It seems like I don't always think it's funny when you're [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8447.779999999999s)]
*  hearing about them bugging their hubcaps and stuff. And it's like, shit, man, [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8452.179999999998s)]
*  it seems like it's just another mob war. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8455.859999999999s)]
*  Like, you know, they're not calling themselves the mob. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8458.06s)]
*  They're calling themselves the government. Right. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8460.98s)]
*  But it's still kind of a mob. It's just one very, very powerful mob. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8463.46s)]
*  We got to be careful about malinformation, Duncan. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8466.9s)]
*  Did I do malinformation? No, but we have to be careful. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8469.42s)]
*  That's why we need this organization protecting us from malinformation. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8471.46s)]
*  If you're wearing a clown suit on a podcast, you're allowed to do malinformation, [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8475.14s)]
*  but you have to wear a stupid fucking clown suit. You know, [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8481.3s)]
*  maybe that's the answer is just like, look, [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8484.34s)]
*  make them wear something really dumb and then they can malinform. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8487.26s)]
*  Maybe that's what the president should be. Maybe you could be the president, [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8490.82s)]
*  but you have to dress like a clown. That's one of our new rules. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8493.46s)]
*  Funny. You can't like, yeah, you can't dress up. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8497.46s)]
*  You have to dress like a clown. Wait, didn't Biden dress like the Easter bunny though? [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8500.26s)]
*  No, Ted Cruz. What? Someone did. Yeah, Jamie, I'm sorry. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8504.86s)]
*  We looked that up. It wasn't, I think it was, it was like the first lady. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8509.619999999999s)]
*  You know, that video of like the bunny, like directing Biden, like that was some. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8515.94s)]
*  Who is that? You haven't seen this Easter bunny or inner like, [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8521.78s)]
*  like the rabbit kind of like made him move on. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8525.380000000001s)]
*  The rabbit made Biden move on. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8529.380000000001s)]
*  So there's Biden waves to the rabbit. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8533.300000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden quickly interrupted by Easter bunny after he's talking about Afghanistan. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8535.18s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8538.980000000001s)]
*  So the Easter bunny came in. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8543.74s)]
*  Hey, it's Easter. It's Easter Mr. President. Come on. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8550.7s)]
*  Oh my God. He stepped right in front of the president while he was making that [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8553.7s)]
*  speech about Afghanistan. He moved him along. That is insane. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8557.5s)]
*  It's fucking wild. It's like the shining. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8561.3s)]
*  What a genius organization we have watching over our best interests. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8563.34s)]
*  Cause that's a great way to do it. Like this is the only way you can do it and get away with it. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8566.58s)]
*  Yeah. He walked away. Easter bunny is like, sir, Mr. President, [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8571.66s)]
*  probably got a gun to his back, sir. This is not a finger. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8575.1s)]
*  I would pay a lot of money to have a fucking Easter bunny follow me around and do [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8577.26s)]
*  that whenever I was about to say some dumb shit. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8580.42s)]
*  It was like a rabbit's like, come on Duncan, let's go. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8583.779999999999s)]
*  We should have that on the podcast. And he said, we're talking about something. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8586.38s)]
*  We don't know what the fuck we're talking about. A rabbit shows up. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8588.5s)]
*  Just comes out of the curtain. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8590.5s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. Malinformation. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8592.9s)]
*  AI rabbit that looks like Coraline's mother. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8595.02s)]
*  Look at that. Yeah. The rabbit's pushed him around. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8597.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, go. The rabbit's guiding him. Yeah, man. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8600.86s)]
*  What in the fuck, dude? Who was the rabbit? Exactly. Who was in the suit? [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8604.14s)]
*  Furries are secretly controlling the government. It's not lizard people. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8608.3s)]
*  Oh, my fucking God. They misread the great scrolls. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8611.5s)]
*  Holy shit. Dude, it could have been an alien in the suit. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8615.46s)]
*  Imagine it could have been anything in the suit. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8618.94s)]
*  Oh, my God. That's what it is. That's what it is. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8621.62s)]
*  It's it's it's imagine it gets in there, takes off the top, and it's a fucking gray [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8623.18s)]

*  That's spooky, man. I mean, it is. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8632.9s)]
*  That's like remember that scene in The Shining? [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8634.54s)]
*  It's real quick where they open the door and it's like a furry. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8637.02s)]
*  Like sucking a guy's dick. Yeah, yeah. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8641.539999999999s)]

*  It's that someone like told them, hey, seven, nine, eight, go interrupt the president. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8655.46s)]
*  He's about to say something about Afghanistan. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8660.34s)]
*  He's talking about Afghanistan. Move, move, move. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8662.14s)]
*  Now go, go. Do we have an Easter bunny near the president? [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8664.22s)]
*  OK, good. Interrupt now. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8668.34s)]
*  Oh, my God. That's so wild. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8670.1s)]
*  It's so wild that you just can't let him talk. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8672.5s)]
*  And it's so wild that Twitter is fact checking him now. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8674.94s)]
*  Twitter fact checks Biden's tweets. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8679.06s)]
*  Look, man, if we're going to do fact checking, it's got to be for everybody. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8681.58s)]
*  It's got to be for everybody. Everybody. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8684.58s)]
*  And that's good for everybody. Yeah. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8686.34s)]
*  You can't have such a lazy game. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8688.06s)]
*  Your propaganda game can't be that lazy. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8689.9s)]
*  How about no fucking propaganda game? [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8693.06s)]
*  Wouldn't that be nice? Like sweet. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8695.06s)]
*  It'd be nice to not be like always constantly getting blasted by some weird fucking propaganda. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8696.9s)]
*  I would love that. I mean, again, it is our fault. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8702.94s)]
*  We're the ones like turning on our propaganda rectangles and like letting it hypnotize us. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8704.82s)]
*  That's true. Consensual propaganda. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8709.82s)]
*  It's not like people are standing in front of our houses with megaphones. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8712.1s)]
*  But it also has real world consequences. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8714.9s)]
*  We're seeing these people and we're seeing like some of the attitudes that they're adopting [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8716.94s)]
*  and some of the things that they're pushing to just stay in control of government. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8723.14s)]
*  It's like you guys are stirring up the bullshit. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8726.78s)]
*  You're stirring. You're misrepresenting people. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8729.58s)]
*  You're doing it to cause conflict and you're doing it to shore up your party. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8732.06s)]
*  And you're doing it wantonly. You're doing it on purpose. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8738.18s)]
*  We can see it. It's real obvious. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8740.94s)]
*  Why do you even? You know, like sometimes I watch Game of Thrones or the new one, which is Badass House of Dragons. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8742.94s)]
*  And you're like, everybody wants to be fucking king. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8749.06s)]
*  Why? It's a managerial job. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8751.78s)]
*  It's like everyone's fighting for just to sit and I. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8754.66s)]
*  Why? It's what we're talking about before. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8759.86s)]
*  That that desire to be the head of the clan, the desire to be the head of the tribe is instilled in all of us. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8762.66s)]
*  Yeah. Came from these. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8768.98s)]
*  We were in these little tribal groups for most of what the time that we were humans. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8770.18s)]
*  For thousands of years, we lived like that until they figured out transportation, [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8775.9s)]
*  till they figured out how to ride animals, until they figured out how to branch out. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8780.74s)]
*  Yeah. We were that's till they figured out boats. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8784.06s)]
*  That's how humans lived. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8786.86s)]
*  That's how we'd be developed into humans. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8788.5s)]
*  But you don't know we survived. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8790.62s)]
*  You don't want to be present. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8792.02s)]
*  No, but it's instilled in the DNA. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8792.74s)]
*  You're a logical person. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8795.06s)]
*  But I would imagine if you weren't and if it was also instilled upon you as a small child, that's the best job in the world. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8797.3s)]
*  And you can't sing and you can't dance. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8806.460000000001s)]
*  You're not good at writing books. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8808.66s)]
*  You can be the fucking president. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8809.98s)]
*  Like, do you fit the right criteria? [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8812.26s)]
*  Are you trustworthy? [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8814.82s)]
*  Can you speak in a way you don't even have to be extraordinary in your accomplishments as an intellectual, as an artist, as anything. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8816.06s)]
*  All you have to do is be this person that talks. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8825.34s)]
*  And a lot of them are lawyers. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8827.14s)]
*  Right. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8828.46s)]
*  And they learn how to talk in a certain way. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8829.1s)]
*  And they're convincing enough. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8832.5s)]
*  And they got enough people to cover up their dirty secrets that they can get into a position of extreme power. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8833.86s)]
*  And the only way out of that is people realizing how dumb that is and people not wanting to do it anymore. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8841.74s)]
*  And you get a smaller and smaller group of people that are running and a less and less interesting and charismatic group of people that are running. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8849.86s)]
*  Because nobody wants that fucking eye of Sauron on you. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8857.18s)]
*  Nobody wants that microscope and your fucking your life and all of your details of it. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8860.300000000001s)]
*  And you want to be the president of what? [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8865.18s)]
*  You out of your fucking mind? [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8867.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you don't want that. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8869.1s)]
*  You don't want that. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8870.300000000001s)]
*  So the only people that do want that are the people that are like so deeply entrenched in that game. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8871.74s)]
*  And we're seeing like with Biden and with Trump, it's people that have been around a long time with Trump, maybe not politics, but around politics a long time. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8875.7s)]
*  And with Biden in politics forever, they're like wrapped up in that system. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8884.26s)]
*  And if you're a fucking motocross rider, you want to be the guy who wins the race. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8888.94s)]
*  It's a fucking game. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8893.539999999999s)]
*  It's your whole day, all day, 12 hours a fucking day. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8895.1s)]
*  That's your you want to get what you put in that bill through. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8898.9s)]
*  You want to talk to your constituents. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8903.46s)]
*  You want to push your narrative. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8905.34s)]
*  You want to do this. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8907.14s)]
*  You want to do it. So winner of death and destruction, death and disease, illness and death. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8908.18s)]
*  That this is like you're you're guiding the zeitgeist of the population. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8916.54s)]
*  Fuck that. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8922.94s)]
*  Isn't that why horrible, wild, annoying and real. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8923.900000000001s)]
*  But that's real. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8927.980000000001s)]
*  That's really actually happening. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8928.86s)]
*  That's really actually happening. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8931.060000000001s)]
*  It's just so it's so fucked up, man. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8934.220000000001s)]
*  Like, it would be so cool if we just evolved to the point where at some point nobody wants to be president. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8936.74s)]
*  Like, no one will run. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8944.34s)]
*  What would they do then? [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8945.42s)]
*  What if everybody was just like, now we're not interested in the job? [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8946.18s)]
*  The promise is always going to be militaries. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8950.060000000001s)]
*  There's always going to be people that are in charge of the militaries. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8952.380000000001s)]
*  If you're in charge of the biggest military and you're the biggest might, you know, you have a real significant advantage over everybody else is talking shit and trying to do things. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8955.060000000001s)]
*  And maybe you're interfering in these countries and maybe you're fucking finagling behind the scenes and, you know, sowing the seeds of resentment and hate around the world because of your policy. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8964.18s)]
*  And maybe that's actually happening and maybe you don't want to lose that power. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8974.1s)]
*  Also, maybe you just really like probably by being in the government, you get security clearance. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8978.78s)]
*  Once you get the security clearance, you start seeing what's really going on. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8985.86s)]
*  Once you start seeing what's really going on, you probably stop talking shit as much as we do. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8990.220000000001s)]
*  You're probably like, oh, I get it now. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=8997.980000000001s)]
*  Well, here's the counter argument. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9001.140000000001s)]
*  The counter argument is you need that because there's so much fucked up shit going on in the world. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9002.220000000001s)]
*  And if we didn't do that, it would be way worse for us. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9005.82s)]
*  That's the counter argument. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9008.78s)]
*  And there's a lot of arguments against counter argument because there's a lot of money involved. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9010.460000000001s)]
*  Right. There's a lot of defense spending, the defense spending. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9014.06s)]
*  The defense spending is crazy numbers. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9017.62s)]
*  So much more than a trillion dollars a year. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9019.7s)]
*  It's so much money. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9022.42s)]
*  So much money. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9023.26s)]
*  So you got to think about there's a lot of business. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9023.9s)]
*  You know, that's the Eisenhower speech where he's talking about the military industrial complex. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9026.02s)]
*  There's a lot of business attached to that, too. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9029.78s)]
*  But there's also the argument that you need it. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9031.34s)]
*  So it's like the argument is not hippie utopia. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9033.42s)]
*  Let's look at the world through rose colored glasses. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9036.14s)]
*  The argument is like, how much are we contributing to the problems of the world and how much are we fixing them? [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9038.619999999999s)]
*  And if the government is not good at anything, there's not one thing. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9044.5s)]
*  They fucking nailed that. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9050.58s)]
*  Nailed it. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9051.58s)]
*  There's not one thing. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9051.94s)]
*  Hold on. Wait, I'll think of something. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9052.86s)]
*  There's got to be something. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9054.9s)]
*  Post office is probably the best thing they've ever done. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9056.18s)]
*  Post office. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9057.74s)]
*  Post office is pretty fucking incredible. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9059.1s)]
*  People shit on the post office. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9060.619999999999s)]
*  It's the only way you're allowed to transport live chicks. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9062.1s)]
*  So if you want to raise chickens, you get live chicks. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9064.699999999999s)]
*  You have to get them transported by the post office. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9067.1s)]
*  No way. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9068.82s)]
*  Yeah, they know how to do it. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9069.38s)]
*  The post. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9071.14s)]
*  So we got the post office. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9071.539999999999s)]
*  There's got to be something else. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9072.74s)]
*  Libraries. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9074.1s)]
*  Libraries. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9075.14s)]
*  Yeah, they do a pretty good job. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9076.38s)]
*  Library of Congress. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9077.539999999999s)]
*  Because people that are involved in libraries are dedicated to giving people books because they know how valuable information is. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9078.859999999999s)]
*  That's the purest example of like wanting to help people. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9085.02s)]
*  Vietnam. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9088.42s)]
*  Went just perfectly. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9093.58s)]
*  That was a really, that war made, that was a good one. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9094.859999999999s)]
*  We learned a lot. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9097.859999999999s)]
*  We learned a lot. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9098.939999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9100.019999999999s)]
*  We learned a lot from Vietnam. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9100.42s)]
*  Was it perfect? [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9102.66s)]
*  No, but we were, but yeah, when you look at like the, the bigger picture, the many, many mistakes that have happened. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9103.74s)]
*  You know, it is curious to me though. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9113.5s)]
*  Like we do live in a time now where it seems like they're like, if you just, it seems like there's almost like a pro, people don't want you to say like, maybe we shouldn't go to war. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9115.140000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9127.06s)]
*  Like if you start saying that you get aligned with one side or the other. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9127.58s)]
*  Well, the thing is Russia invaded Ukraine. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9130.7s)]
*  Russia, they connected Trump. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9133.1s)]
*  Trump is bad. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9134.66s)]
*  Trump collude Russia. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9135.86s)]
*  That was a narrative for so long. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9137.34s)]
*  Right. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9138.54s)]
*  So it's whether you believe it or not, whether it's been refuted or not, I think mostly it has. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9138.98s)]
*  But at the end of the day, they really were successful in connecting Trump to Russia. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9144.22s)]
*  Like there's like the, this is the feeling you get when you feel about Russia. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9149.34s)]
*  You're, you're an anti-Trump guy and then Russia invades Ukraine. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9152.66s)]
*  Okay. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9156.1s)]
*  This is a horrible act of war. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9156.38s)]
*  Clearly there's one party that has escalated this to the point of violence. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9159.58s)]
*  And it should be, yeah, it's the worst thing that could ever happen in the world. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9164.14s)]
*  When a neighboring country invades a neighbor, a fucking Jesus Christ in the world has to sit back and watch this. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9167.699999999999s)]
*  Horrible. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9173.98s)]
*  There's no ifs, ands or buts about that. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9175.06s)]
*  So everybody is like pushing to arm Ukraine. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9176.9s)]
*  And I don't see a lot of people clamoring for some sort of a peace agreement or at least conversations about it. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9180.779999999999s)]
*  I know they've had some conversations, Zelensky, he wants like Putin to resign. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9191.06s)]
*  You know, like, have you ever seen that? [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9196.1s)]
*  Like that he wants Putin to step down. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9198.26s)]
*  Like that's one of the things. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9199.9s)]
*  Didn't he say that? [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9201.46s)]
*  He said he would talk to Russia, but he wouldn't talk to the president of Russia or something like that. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9202.26s)]
*  He definitely wants him to step down. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9206.58s)]
*  He wants him to step down. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9207.98s)]
*  It's like the, the like, you know, I, [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9209.06s)]
*  But he's saying that is that the only thing that will accept? [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9211.82s)]
*  Is that what he said? [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9214.9s)]
*  The best analysis of it I saw was on Russian state TV where the, some of the people on Russian state TV are starting to say, wait a minute. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9215.54s)]
*  And this guy was like, look, you have Ukraine is we're not, I don't remember the words he used. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9223.460000000001s)]
*  Well, I don't speak Russian. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9228.5s)]
*  They were translating it, but he's essentially saying like, look, you're not, you're not. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9229.380000000001s)]
*  They, he was saying these are the people, these are Russians. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9234.62s)]
*  They survived this or that. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9237.94s)]
*  I can't remember the exact thing they're talking about. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9239.34s)]
*  The siege of, I don't remember what it's called. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9240.94s)]
*  I'm sorry, man. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9243.54s)]
*  I'm, I'm terrible at history, but like he's like, these are Russians. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9244.26s)]
*  They survived all this. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9247.34s)]
*  You're not going to starve them out. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9248.34s)]
*  You're not going to freeze them out. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9249.98s)]
*  They're not backing down. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9251.42s)]
*  You don't have their minds. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9252.86s)]
*  They're, you're not going to get them to surrender. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9254.06s)]
*  So where's the out? [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9256.06s)]
*  Like the idea was quick invasion. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9257.94s)]
*  You, they're going to surrender right away. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9260.78s)]
*  And then he's going to like take a chunk of Ukraine and then everything, everything like [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9264.34s)]
*  ends, but it sucks because still he, whatever. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9270.22s)]
*  But it's like, it's not working. [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9273.5s)]
*  So even there's no way to like say like, all right, well, let's concede this, the [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9275.38s)]
*  Dom boss or whatever to Russia, because the Ukraine is like, fuck that. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9281.42s)]
*  We're taking Crimea back. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9284.619999999999s)]
*  Like we're taking all of it back because they're starting to win and they're winning [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9286.14s)]
*  because the largest military on earth has been giving them God knows what we only God [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9289.94s)]
*  knows what, like what kind of data they're getting from like satellites. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9295.66s)]
*  We don't even know are up there. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9300.539999999999s)]
*  Russia's threatening to shoot down satellites. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9301.9s)]
*  Well, that's why, because like the, I'm sure we're giving the, giving them like [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9303.859999999999s)]
*  hardcore data about everything. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9308.5s)]
*  So it's like, man, this is what's so scary about it. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9311.779999999999s)]
*  Isn't it? [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9314.699999999999s)]
*  It's like, where is the concession that has to happen for a war to end? [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9315.02s)]
*  Where's the thing where Russia, where Putin can like successfully withdraw the troops? [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9319.78s)]
*  Right. [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9327.86s)]
*  And why isn't this the conversation like that you're seeing amongst most people online? [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9328.140000000001s)]
*  Shouldn't most people online be saying that instead of like just blindly supporting [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9333.9s)]
*  one side or the other? [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9337.54s)]
*  Shouldn't they be going, we got to stop this in its fucking tracks? [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9338.66s)]
*  Well, yeah, the, the, what I feel like what should be happening is a massive public, [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9341.900000000001s)]
*  like demand for there to be talks between everybody. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9349.18s)]
*  Like to like in Russia, they should be like fucking talk to Zelensky. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9354.94s)]
*  Here we should be like fucking Biden talk to fucking Putin. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9358.82s)]
*  You know, not just about what's her name. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9362.78s)]
*  Britney Grindle. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9366.300000000001s)]
*  Not just about her, but let's, let's, as grotesque as it might be to sit down and try to [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9366.86s)]
*  negotiate with people who thought it was a good idea to just fucking invade another country [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9373.3s)]
*  and kill a bunch of people. [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9377.5s)]
*  It's preferable to nuclear holocaust. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9379.22s)]
*  Yes. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9382.699999999999s)]
*  So let's just fucking, it's gross. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9383.1s)]
*  No one wants to do it. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9385.34s)]
*  Like, you know, that, that whole thing, there was a period, I don't know if you did that, [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9386.779999999999s)]
*  but for a while you start like watching like documentaries on Putin and you catch that [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9390.1s)]
*  weird aspect of him. [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9394.26s)]
*  You're like, there's something kind of cool about him, right? [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9395.34s)]
*  There was like this weird, cool thing. [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9398.099999999999s)]
*  That's gone. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9399.42s)]
*  We all think he's a fucking like tyrannical asshole. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9400.34s)]

*  Nobody likes him. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9404.5s)]
*  He's horrible. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9405.34s)]

*  The, the, the doesn't end in a nuclear holocaust, like, or something worse. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9414.34s)]

*  Like they got all kinds of shit over there that, that, you know, lots of stuff just like we do. [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9422.9s)]

*  Right. [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9487.380000000001s)]
*  How do you get into it? [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9487.740000000002s)]
*  How do you summon the spirit of rationality in a place where people for just for like [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9488.62s)]

*  People had to watch people were at a playground and fucking Russia shot missiles into it. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9500.78s)]
*  How do you fucking make that work after that? [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9506.02s)]
*  You don't, you don't. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9509.26s)]
*  And then it's like, okay, well, we're going to stop giving them weapons because we don't [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9511.06s)]
*  want there to be a nuclear holocaust. [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9513.78s)]
*  So it's like, really? [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9515.06s)]
*  You don't want to push back against this massive empire that just decided to encroach [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9516.619999999999s)]
*  upon another country. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9521.539999999999s)]

*  It's, I don't know the solution, man. [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9524.66s)]
*  What's the fucking solution? [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9526.3s)]
*  You know, it's like we need our presidents to have that thing that the chest dude had [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9528.22s)]
*  up his ass. [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9532.38s)]
*  You know, something that's vibrating like, for aliens. [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9533.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9536.78s)]
*  For me. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9537.14s)]
*  Give us all the data. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9537.34s)]
*  Now, the most hopeful version for me of this alien thing is that they're monitoring all [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9539.18s)]
*  this and they realize there's a point in civilization, just like there's a point in the [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9546.34s)]
*  evolution of every, anything that's competitive. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9552.74s)]
*  Right. [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9557.34s)]
*  It's like they're trying to like succeed and squash out all the things that are against [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9557.86s)]
*  them. And if they have the capability of literally destroying thousands of people and [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9563.1s)]
*  they do it on a regular basis. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9568.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9570.06s)]
*  So thousands of people is pretty normal. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9570.3s)]
*  Right. [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9572.18s)]
*  Thousands of people in Ukraine is right. [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9572.619999999999s)]
*  Thousands of people are dead. [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9574.539999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9575.7s)]
*  How many people have been killed by drones? [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9575.98s)]
*  All told. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9577.42s)]
*  It's got to be a thousand. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9578.58s)]
*  Right. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9579.619999999999s)]
*  How many people? [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9579.86s)]
*  Way over that. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9580.18s)]
*  Let's just, let's take a guess. [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9581.26s)]
*  How many people do you think have been ever killed by drones in warfare? [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9582.66s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9588.58s)]
*  What do you think it is? [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9590.9s)]
*  It's got to be like, it's got to be over a hundred thousand people. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9593.26s)]
*  Right. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9598.02s)]
*  I'm going to guess. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9600.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9602.7s)]
*  I'm going to guess like 80,000 people. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9603.18s)]
*  How many people have been killed by drones ever? [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9605.5s)]
*  I'm just guessing. [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9611.38s)]
*  I have no idea what it would be. [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9612.46s)]
*  What is it? [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9614.74s)]
*  Hold on. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9615.82s)]
*  I'm trying to find the answer. [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9619.38s)]
*  It's mixing a bunch of stuff together at once. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9620.699999999999s)]
*  Oh, you want to read it? [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9622.619999999999s)]
*  I said, oh shit. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9623.5s)]
*  Well, no, no, I'm just on Google. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9624.06s)]
*  The one I said is like military. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9625.18s)]
*  How many people have the US military killed in general? [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9627.539999999999s)]
*  Oh, by drone. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9629.98s)]
*  Oh, I Googled drones. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9631.22s)]
*  Well, how about just a number of deaths by drone per year? [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9632.939999999999s)]
*  I got a counting drone, drone death strikes. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9636.98s)]
*  There's no number. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9642.14s)]
*  They haven't bothered. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9645.019999999999s)]
*  The estimates are incomplete. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9645.779999999999s)]
*  Like whatever, whatever. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9647.539999999999s)]
*  I'm paying attention to that. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9649.18s)]
*  Do you ever see that art installation that like any time a drone strike [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9650.06s)]
*  happened, it like lit a match, it was just, it would sit there. [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9653.38s)]
*  And then when it got somehow it was connected to like whatever that is. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9656.22s)]
*  So it like, whenever there's a drone strike, it likes a match or something [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9659.66s)]
*  with light and it would just drop it on the ground or it would like burn a piece [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9663.06s)]
*  of paper, just drop it on the ground. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9666.38s)]
*  The scariest thing about the drones is the number of people that are innocent. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9668.66s)]
*  They get killed. [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9671.78s)]
*  US airstrikes killed at least 22,000 civilians since 9 11. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9673.14s)]
*  Way lower than we thought. [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9677.06s)]
*  Way lower. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9678.38s)]
*  Figures based on reported numbers of US airstrikes highlight the human cost [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9679.34s)]
*  of the 20 year war on terror. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9683.34s)]
*  So, but that's airstrikes. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9685.34s)]
*  That could be missiles launched out of jets, right? [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9688.14s)]
*  Couldn't it be other things other than just drones? [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9692.5s)]
*  I mean, way more people are dying from fentanyl than US drone and airstrikes. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9695.3s)]
*  So it's combined. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9699.42s)]
*  That's what it is. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9700.58s)]
*  It's both of those things. [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9701.14s)]
*  So drone and airstrikes as perhaps as many as 48,000. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9702.58s)]
*  Wow. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9708.9s)]
*  That's a lot of people. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9709.539999999999s)]
*  So they've killed at least 22,000 and perhaps as many as 48,000 since the 9 11 [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9710.34s)]
*  terror attacks. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9716.18s)]
*  The analysis based on US military's own assertion is that it has conducted almost [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9718.06s)]
*  100,000 airstrikes since 2001. [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9722.74s)]
*  Holy shit, dude. [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9726.14s)]
*  represents an attempt to estimate the number of civilian deaths across the [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9728.22s)]
*  multiple conflicts that have comprised aspects of the war on terror. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9732.38s)]
*  Holy shit, dude. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9736.98s)]
*  Just, just, I want you to just think about a hundred thousand airstrikes. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9739.34s)]
*  Imagine watching that video. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9746.26s)]
*  It'd be a long video. [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9748.62s)]
*  That's a long video. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9749.74s)]
*  Wow. [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9752.7s)]
*  Super sad. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9753.9s)]
*  Super sad. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9754.7s)]
*  Potentially as high as 48,308 civilians killed. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9755.5s)]
*  The numbers nuts too. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9759.9s)]
*  It's like mostly the wrong people. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9761.06s)]
*  Man, I don't know. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9764.539999999999s)]
*  I just really hope that like somehow by some fucking miracle, somehow, somehow, [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9765.26s)]
*  like just like it, it, it's a, to me, it's really, it's caught me, man. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9772.94s)]
*  Like the, the, the, the, the war has caught me. [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9778.78s)]
*  I look at it every night. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9781.82s)]
*  I'm always like checking it out. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9783.02s)]
*  Cause you know, I got kids now. [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9784.82s)]
*  It's terrifying for everybody, for loved ones, for society as we know it. [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9786.460000000001s)]
*  Terrifying for everything about everything about life. [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9790.62s)]
*  And it's like, like it's what's really, I think the most, like the thing that [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9793.26s)]
*  freaks me out the most is like, truly all, all that has to happen is one dude has [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9800.1s)]
*  to go, you know what I fucked up. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9807.26s)]
*  Yo, you're probably my, you're going to kill me or I'm going to get arrested. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9809.7s)]
*  I fucked up and just bring all the troops out and it's done. [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9812.82s)]
*  Like that's it. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9817.06s)]
*  That's the thing that's like, so I don't think it's that easy, man. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9817.98s)]
*  You don't think you don't think it's imbalances in place. [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9820.46s)]
*  Putin, I think it just be like, let's I fucked up. [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9822.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9826.1s)]
*  I don't think he's ever going to say that. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9826.26s)]
*  I don't think you can say that when you want to be running a strong country [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9827.699999999999s)]
*  like Russia, I literally don't think that's like in the way they ever communicate. [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9830.58s)]
*  Well, I know, but I know, but it's weird, right? [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9834.14s)]
*  Like, it's almost like you're asking them to blow guys on TV. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9837.06s)]
*  Like it's not going to happen. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9841.1s)]
*  You know, it's like he's, he's such a old school leader in the weirdest sense of [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9842.42s)]
*  like the appealing to that one alpha that runs the tribe. [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9849.460000000001s)]
*  He's so old school in that regard. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9852.98s)]
*  It's like a, a figure of history, right? [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9854.78s)]
*  The, the man that controls this entire country, that's a common figure in history. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9857.140000000001s)]
*  And that's what he is now. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9862.86s)]
*  And we, we just forget that that's how humans are kind of hardwired. [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9863.82s)]
*  And I really, I mean, obviously, yeah, not an anthropologist, but I would [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9868.02s)]
*  assume that that has something to do with the way we developed in tribes and that [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9871.7s)]
*  we still, we can't get away from it with that guy. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9875.18s)]
*  We can't get away from with the Trump lovers with, with everything. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9876.980000000001s)]
*  Everybody wants some person that's our solution to all this things. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9880.34s)]
*  Carrie Lake's going to take us home. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9882.980000000001s)]
*  You know, everybody's got this thing in their head that they think is going to [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9884.78s)]
*  be the solution to all the problems. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9887.78s)]
*  And I'm not saying that those people aren't individual solutions to problems [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9890.060000000001s)]
*  that are happening locally around. [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9892.740000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think they are. [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9894.300000000001s)]
*  And I think that's maybe that makes sense even more than a president. [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9895.58s)]
*  But at the end of the day, when all is said and done, it's fucking strange. [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9899.5s)]
*  It's fucking strange that there's all this unnecessary conflict that's consistently [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9904.78s)]
*  going on all around us and we don't question it. [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9909.06s)]
*  We don't go like, what, what kind of nonsense world are we living in? [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9911.82s)]
*  We don't have much time, kids. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9914.82s)]
*  We should be a lot nicer to each other. [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9916.46s)]
*  It's not that hard. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9918.66s)]
*  Right. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9919.66s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9920.539999999999s)]
*  I mean, that, like it, it all goes back to that. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9921.18s)]
*  It's like, all right, well, get off. [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9924.3s)]
*  I'm talking to myself here. [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9926.46s)]
*  This is by the way, I've here's my shit. [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9927.5s)]
*  Here's my spirit, shitty spiritual advice is what I've discovered. [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9930.06s)]
*  I'm telling you, man, it's changed my life. [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9934.82s)]
*  Anytime instead of the old days when I blither and blather and earbeat people [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9937.1s)]
*  with some spiritual fucking advice for their lives, anytime I'm about to do that. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9941.98s)]
*  I don't. [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9946.82s)]
*  And I apply it to myself. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9948.06s)]
*  So it's like, if I'm about to like suggest to someone that maybe exercise is [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9950.18s)]
*  going to make them feel better. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9955.38s)]
*  I exercise. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9957.779999999999s)]
*  Or if I'm like, you know what, maybe, maybe you should meditate. [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9959.019999999999s)]
*  That's when I meditate. [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9963.019999999999s)]
*  Instead of saying it, I just start applying it to myself. [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9964.099999999999s)]
*  Holy shit, man. [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9966.619999999999s)]
*  It's really fucking good advice for me. [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9967.619999999999s)]
*  You're taking your own advice. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9970.539999999999s)]
*  For me, not for anyone, because it's easier to get someone else to exercise than [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9971.859999999999s)]
*  to get you, than to get you to exercise and meditate. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9976.259999999998s)]
*  So it's like, it's like what I'm doing right now, and I'm not recommending this [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9978.66s)]
*  for anybody else, is I'm just trying to calm the fuck down. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9983.38s)]
*  Just calm down. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9986.339999999998s)]
*  Stop getting so fucking frustrated. [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9987.619999999999s)]
*  Stop being like wobbly or, or like unstable. [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9989.82s)]
*  Try to maintain stability in an honest way around my family and friends [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=9994.66s)]
*  for as much as I can. [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10000.74s)]
*  That's why I quit drinking. [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10002.38s)]
*  And it's working wonders. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10003.42s)]
*  It's working wonders. [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10007.38s)]
*  So it's like, you know, with this stuff, it's so frustrating because it's like, [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10008.38s)]
*  what the fuck are we going to do? [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10011.06s)]
*  What? [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10012.66s)]
*  I guarantee Putin, Putin isn't going to listen to this podcast and be like, you [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10013.74s)]
*  know what, maybe instead of the war, I will start blowing dudes on TV. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10017.78s)]
*  That's not going to happen. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10024.54s)]
*  You're right. [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10025.42s)]
*  But it's like, yeah, so that's frustrating. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10026.060000000001s)]
*  There's a very limited realm of control we have out there. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10029.94s)]
*  So it's like, all right, what do you have control over? [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10032.94s)]
*  What do you have control over? [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10035.58s)]
*  And it's like that thing you were talking about when we went out to eat. [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10037.1s)]
*  You're like, you got to put that monster in a box. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10040.14s)]
*  That thing, whatever your particular monster may be, figure out a way. [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10043.58s)]
*  Keep it in the box. [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10048.38s)]
*  Eventually you can actually melt it down. [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10049.5s)]
*  Like he doesn't even have to be a monster anymore. [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10052.18s)]
*  They say that you could actually over time, the thing becomes less and less [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10053.859999999999s)]
*  and less and less of a monster. [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10060.98s)]
*  But we were talking about mental illness that applies to obsessing on things. [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10062.26s)]
*  Which is why we can't fuck with video games. [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10066.3s)]
*  That's what the monster was for us. [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10068.099999999999s)]
*  That monster is this desire to get immersed in things. [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10069.859999999999s)]
*  And it's fucking creepy. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10076.179999999998s)]
*  It takes people, like gamblers, they're possessed by demons. [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10078.339999999998s)]
*  Like hardcore gamblers. [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10082.14s)]
*  Do you see Uncut Gems? [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10083.46s)]
*  No. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10085.38s)]
*  It's amazing. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10085.82s)]
*  It's an Adam Sandler movie. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10086.939999999999s)]
*  I watch it. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10088.06s)]
*  And it's not a comedy at all. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10088.3s)]
*  It's a fucking great movie. [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10089.74s)]
*  It's probably one of the best movies about gambling, if not the best ever made. [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10091.539999999999s)]
*  It's really good. [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10094.779999999999s)]
*  It'll give you anxiety. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10095.66s)]
*  You'd be like, Oh my God, Jesus fucking Christ. [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10097.1s)]
*  When you're watching this movie, you're like, Oh my God. [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10100.060000000001s)]
*  It's all about a gambling junkie. [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10102.300000000001s)]
*  Adam Sandler plays it perfectly. [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10104.300000000001s)]
*  And the movie is all about these rushes that these people get from gambling. [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10107.140000000001s)]
*  And it just takes over every aspect of their life. [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10111.26s)]
*  Just like a fucking video game. [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10114.380000000001s)]
*  Just like anything else, man. [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10116.1s)]
*  Things can take over your life. [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10117.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10119.78s)]
*  That's it. [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10120.54s)]

*  I'm not saying it's easy. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10246.94s)]
*  Habits are really hard to break, man. [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10247.82s)]
*  This is one of the real problems that psychedelics being outlawed, right? [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10249.26s)]
*  Is that people aren't allowed to have these sort of transcendent moments in [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10253.14s)]
*  those psychedelic experiences because some people truly can't handle it. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10257.38s)]
*  Some people it's not for them. [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10261.66s)]
*  That's absolutely true. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10262.86s)]
*  I agree. [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10264.06s)]
*  But for a lot of people it is. [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10265.14s)]
*  And you can't say it doesn't benefit a lot of people. [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10267.14s)]
*  I know so many fucking people who have benefited from it, including me. [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10269.539999999999s)]
*  And to deny that to people, to deny that, keep that from people, I [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10273.339999999998s)]

*  Our development as a community. [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10282.779999999999s)]
*  It would help us develop as a community if people had some experience with [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10284.66s)]
*  regenerating their view of the world. [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10290.58s)]
*  Yes. [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10292.9s)]
*  And that could be available to everybody, but it's being withheld from you by [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10293.82s)]
*  people who haven't experienced it. [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10298.9s)]

*  would be to spread these to everybody and to give people the chance to recognize [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10309.42s)]
*  that maybe they're under the, the hypnotism, the, maybe they're under the [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10314.14s)]
*  spell of a certain frequency. [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10317.779999999999s)]
*  That's not the only way to live. [[02:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10319.98s)]
*  You can live in a different frequency. [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10321.619999999999s)]
*  You can, you can establish a different frequency amongst the people you love. [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10323.06s)]
*  You can establish a different frequency with yourself. [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10326.1s)]
*  It's possible. [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10328.66s)]
*  And to deny that from people just because you're afraid of it or because of [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10329.82s)]
*  propaganda, it's like, it's very anti-science because there's a lot of [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10335.82s)]
*  science that points to it, helping people with all sorts of things. [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10339.9s)]
*  End of life crises. [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10343.38s)]
*  That's a giant one with people have taken psilocybin. [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10345.14s)]
*  It's, it's allowed them to really relax and think about existence and look at [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10348.7s)]
*  it in a completely different way. [[02:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10353.86s)]
*  And I don't think that's available through just some, someone sitting next to [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10355.46s)]
*  you and ask you questions and having a counseling session. [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10358.5s)]

*  And it's, it's not going to kill you. [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10369.1s)]
*  It's not, I mean, if, especially if we figure out a way to grow it legally where [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10370.82s)]
*  shit gets inspected, it's going to be good for you. [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10375.82s)]

*  Like whatever that experience is, is probably makes like when you're dying, [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10382.1s)]
*  when you're actually dying, you're like, fuck man, this is like so much nicer [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10386.460000000001s)]

*  them and infinity to the point where they're just like filling up with their own ego. [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10442.3s)]

*  it is to sort of realize, oh no, I'm much more than this little thing that is [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10481.26s)]
*  currently parading around with my name much more than that. [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10490.38s)]
*  And then you, then you really calm down. [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10493.42s)]
*  Like that's when you're really going to calm down because it's not quite the same [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10495.66s)]
*  anymore. [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10499.259999999998s)]
*  And then when you just that little bit of calming down, it's going to make other [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10500.099999999999s)]
*  people around you calm down. [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10503.46s)]
*  I'm telling you, man, the conversation should be, should not, doesn't have to be [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10504.9s)]
*  around politics. [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10509.14s)]
*  It should be eventually around politics because that's what shapes laws and [[02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10511.859999999999s)]
*  everything like that. [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10515.220000000001s)]
*  But it needs to start with this fundamental truth, which is humans can [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10515.78s)]
*  suffer less. [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10522.220000000001s)]
*  You as an individual don't have to suffer as much as you're suffering. [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10523.300000000001s)]
*  There's ways for you to reduce your suffering in a real way that don't involve [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10527.7s)]
*  fentanyl, doesn't involve opioids, doesn't involve the nitrous hit of power or [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10532.9s)]
*  winning at gambling. [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10537.62s)]
*  There's an actual way that you can like. [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10539.02s)]
*  Well, you know, one of the words for enlightenment and Buddhism translates to [[02:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10542.5s)]
*  extinguish, blow out the candle. [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10547.94s)]

*  You can actually do it in this life. [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10557.5s)]
*  That's exciting to me because it's not just a LARP. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10559.82s)]
*  It's not LARPing like all the mystics of the world and whatever religion they're [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10562.38s)]
*  in. [[02:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10565.98s)]

*  They're actually like many people have figured out a way not to suffer as much. [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10570.339999999998s)]
*  And that's exciting to me, man. [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10574.939999999999s)]
*  That's fucking cool. [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10576.5s)]

*  That transcends culture. [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10579.66s)]
*  It transcends countries. [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10581.619999999999s)]
*  It transcends language. [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10583.82s)]
*  It's you know what I mean? [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10585.9s)]

*  I mean, it's harder for animals can't do that. [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10592.98s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10596.539999999999s)]
*  A squirrel is going to fucking squirrel. [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10597.099999999999s)]

*  Yeah man, a squirrel is going to squirrel. [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10601.66s)]

*  And that that definitely has nothing to do with politics. [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10620.179999999998s)]
*  It's something that connects all of us. [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10623.939999999999s)]

*  You know, up and down, up and down and up and down and drinking and driving and [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10659.580000000002s)]

*  I responded to it. [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10804.58s)]
*  I like posted an applause meme under his tweet. [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10805.66s)]
*  Then there was effective propaganda. [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10808.7s)]
*  God damn it, man. [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10810.5s)]
*  I just I can't even imagine how many things I've been. [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10811.42s)]
*  Here it is. [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10814.1s)]
*  Last week, President Joe Biden announced the largest act of clemency in a generation, a [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10815.3s)]
*  mass pardon for people convicted of federal marijuana possession. [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10819.26s)]
*  As far as bold acts of mass demancy, clemency go. [[03:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10822.78s)]
*  Duh. [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10827.62s)]
*  It won't lead to many people getting out of prison. [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10828.62s)]
*  In fact, it will lead to none. [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10830.5s)]
*  Zero people. [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10833.3s)]
*  But OK, let me let me just say this. [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10833.94s)]
*  Let me speak in defense of it. [[03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10836.1s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[03:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10838.38s)]
*  No, I don't mean I'm saying like. [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10839.7s)]
*  I'm thinking of like my friends who are like marijuana activists. [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10842.9s)]
*  I know you have them too. [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10845.3s)]
*  Yes. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10846.14s)]
*  Or even psychedelic advocates. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10846.74s)]
*  When she just gets on the ballot, they celebrate because they're like, OK, we got it on the [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10848.7s)]
*  ballot. [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10853.54s)]
*  Right. [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10854.06s)]
*  So I think there is something that's exciting, even though that's sad what you what you [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10854.42s)]
*  told me earlier and just showed there's something really fucking cool that the president [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10859.86s)]
*  has finally at least talking about it, admitted that like this bullshit, people are going [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10865.22s)]
*  to jail for possession of marijuana. [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10870.54s)]
*  Now, obviously, there is political reasons for that and there's all kinds of other dark [[03:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10872.06s)]
*  stuff wrapped up in it. [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10876.14s)]
*  But long term, good sign. [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10877.14s)]
*  Long term, good sign. [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10879.98s)]
*  Right. [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10881.26s)]
*  We just want progress quicker. [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10881.5s)]
*  We want progress. [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10882.7s)]
*  We want it quicker. [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10883.86s)]
*  But that's progress. [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10884.619999999999s)]
*  So in a lot of people, a lot of people dedicated their lives to getting just that far [[03:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10886.14s)]
*  with it. You know, so I think there's something to be said for it. [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10893.1s)]
*  I get it, man. [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10896.02s)]
*  Nothing happens. [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10896.94s)]
*  It influences the cultural narrative. [[03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10898.02s)]
*  It influences the cultural narrative and it could potentially cause like a shift in views [[03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10900.42s)]
*  around like marijuana consumption long term. [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10906.26s)]
*  And then but, you know, yeah, it's dark. [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10909.26s)]
*  The real that no one's actually getting out that it was just a fucking it's a ruse, a [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10911.82s)]
*  ruse that I fell for. [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10916.42s)]
*  Joe, I fell for so many ruses and Twitter will now fact check those ruses, which is [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10918.06s)]
*  hilarious, which is fucking important to people that don't want that. [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10923.019999999999s)]
*  Come on, kids. [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10926.38s)]
*  You've been wanting fact checks for so long. [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10927.699999999999s)]
*  Every time someone brings up the you know, whether it's the election theft or this or [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10929.98s)]
*  everybody. Come on. [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10936.02s)]
*  Fact checks are probably good if the president's not telling the truth and it's really [[03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10937.660000000002s)]

*  Probably that's good kids. [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10944.900000000001s)]
*  Listen, I'm fine with like universal, non biased fact checking. [[03:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10946.140000000001s)]
*  In fact, I would like that for myself. [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10953.58s)]
*  Like it would be I want to know what I'm saying. [[03:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10956.5s)]
*  That's like I would love it. [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=10958.58s)]

*  There's been a few of those weird cases where you like you got to think that throughout [[03:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11068.9s)]
*  history. [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11074.5s)]

*  That's what you can do. [[03:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11198.38s)]
*  Like, whatever most effective thing you can do. [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11199.66s)]
*  That's it. As far as like the other stuff goes, it's like if you can help, if you're if [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11201.66s)]
*  you're a human trafficker right now, listening to this, driving your fucking you all across [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11207.22s)]

*  But most people, it's like, you're not having to deal with that. [[03:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11219.580000000002s)]
*  You're really just having to deal with the fact that when you wake up in a bad mood, you [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11224.060000000001s)]

*  You it sounds so dumb, so dumb, so obvious. [[03:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11234.7s)]
*  But really, that is kind of the I heard the Dalai Lama say it. [[03:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11238.3s)]
*  Do. This is what he said. [[03:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11242.22s)]

*  It's like, that's it. [[03:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11252.18s)]
*  That's what it all boils down to. [[03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11253.3s)]
*  Look, maybe you're not in a position right now where you can help anybody. [[03:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11255.099999999999s)]
*  But for sure, you don't have to say the shitty thing you're about to say to somebody because [[03:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11258.58s)]
*  you're mad. That you could stop. [[03:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11264.019999999999s)]
*  Like you could stop that. [[03:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11266.46s)]
*  And that's a big deal, man. [[03:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11267.539999999999s)]

*  The greatest moment is when they were going to react with anger and they didn't. [[03:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11278.1s)]
*  That's a huge moment, man. [[03:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11286.14s)]
*  That's a huge moment when you manage to like rein in that fucking thing just once. [[03:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11288.3s)]
*  It's a big deal. [[03:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11295.26s)]
*  But, you know, if you keep doing it, that's when you start traveling through the multiverse [[03:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11296.66s)]
*  because everything around you gets completely different quick. [[03:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11302.02s)]

*  It's you know, you get upset about things and you have to keep them under control. [[03:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11317.980000000001s)]
*  And it's hard to like it's hard to have a balanced perspective. [[03:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11321.300000000001s)]
*  You know, it's it's hard when someone cuts you off in traffic to just to let it go [[03:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11325.7s)]

*  No. [[03:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11340.78s)]

*  because of it. [[03:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11400.94s)]
*  Most of the time they got away with it. [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11401.82s)]
*  Those obviously whoever those people are, that's not the first time they got angry. [[03:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11403.42s)]

*  It's like dying. [[03:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11416.82s)]
*  Like you become something else for a second. [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11417.82s)]
*  It's you become an animal and you know why it happens on the highway? [[03:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11420.02s)]
*  Why? [[03:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11423.94s)]
*  Because people are so ramped up because it's dangerous. [[03:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11424.38s)]
*  So you're going so fast. [[03:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11426.98s)]

*  So when you're on alert, it's a predatory thing. [[03:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11443.34s)]
*  It's a thing that's like it's wired into our DNA to like, if you're on alert, you're [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11445.5s)]
*  worried about something that's going to attack you. [[03:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11450.18s)]
*  You worried about something coming out. [[03:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11452.300000000001s)]
*  You're ready. [[03:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11453.94s)]

*  And everyone's just choosing when they change lanes. [[03:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11461.62s)]
*  The amount of freedom you have when you're behind a wheel to be an asshole is [[03:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11464.7s)]
*  extraordinary. [[03:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11468.34s)]

*  Shanti Davis, way of the Bodhisattva says, [[03:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11572.02s)]

*  It is a powerful thing. [[03:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11593.58s)]
*  And being able to have more control over it is a great feeling [[03:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11594.74s)]
*  because it makes you feel like you can do a lot of different stuff on top of that. [[03:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11600.58s)]
*  If you can, like as I've matured and gotten better at managing my own brain, [[03:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11604.54s)]
*  I've also become much more productive. Right. [[03:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11608.86s)]

*  making the same mistakes over and over again, whenever I'm doing that, [[03:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11618.22s)]
*  that's when I'm the most unproductive. [[03:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11621.74s)]

*  Like you're like always following your past around, past decisions around [[03:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11636.94s)]
*  cleaning up broken glass and old fucking like [[03:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11641.1s)]
*  bits of concrete from the last crater you put in your life. [[03:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11645.94s)]
*  It's like, man, it's exhausting. It's exhausting. [[03:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11649.58s)]
*  A lot of work. It's a lot of work. [[03:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11652.78s)]
*  And that's, you know, again, we go back to the the human mind [[03:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11654.74s)]

*  It's one of the most complex things that anybody could ever use. [[03:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11661.42s)]
*  And it doesn't come with directions. [[03:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11664.060000000001s)]
*  And you learn from the people that are around you. [[03:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11666.18s)]
*  And it's hard to unlearn shit that's stupid. [[03:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11667.9s)]
*  But I think is as chaotic as this time is, it's the most promising [[03:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11670.94s)]
*  because it's the most interesting in terms of the way ideas get assaulted [[03:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11677.86s)]
*  and reworked and thought up and debated. [[03:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11682.02s)]
*  And even though we're there's suppression of information, [[03:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11684.26s)]
*  there's definitely suppression of free speech in certain platforms. [[03:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11687.34s)]
*  There's still more exchange of thoughts than like ever in a tumultuous way [[03:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11690.7s)]
*  where people just want it to end. [[03:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11696.1s)]

*  And that's what we do. And the atmosphere imitates us. [[03:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11717.98s)]
*  And the atmosphere. And we are the atmosphere. [[03:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHIBF3abE6Y&t=11720.46s)]
