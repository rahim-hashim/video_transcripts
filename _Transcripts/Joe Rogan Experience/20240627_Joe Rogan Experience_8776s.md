# Joe Rogan Experience #2095 - Moshe Kasher
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6.0s)]
*  Are we rolling? Hi. Let's roll. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=10.0s)]
*  So they want to save the universe and then they want to fuck everyone's wife. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=15.0s)]
*  Oh yes, yes. It always begins, yeah, yeah. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=18.0s)]
*  The dimensional portal will open and then it ends with, you can't fuck your wife anymore, but guess who can? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=21.0s)]
*  Yeah, what happens is, first they start stockpiling guns. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=25.0s)]
*  Yes. Yeah, it seems like cult leaders have to have guns because their faith and their ability to see the universe and all the good and everything is not quite good enough. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=29.0s)]
*  You need an AR. You need an AR to really get your point across. Quite a few. You need maybe some flash grenades. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=41.0s)]
*  I mean, it is interesting. It doesn't feel like, it feels like I wouldn't do that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=46.0s)]
*  If you were running a cult? Well, I wouldn't fuck your wife and make you like worship me. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=51.0s)]
*  Well, you're a very nice guy. I'm one of the nicest guys in America. You're a very nice guy. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=56.0s)]
*  I don't know anyone who doesn't like you, by the way. Is that true? Yes. I've never met anybody like that. That guy's a dick. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=60.0s)]
*  Oh, that's really cool. No one. I love that. Everybody likes you. You're a nice guy. I like, thank you. You're a nice guy too. Thank you. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=65.0s)]
*  Yeah. I have made that a mark on my life. I want to be a good guy. Yes, it's a good thing to do. I try really, I work at it. Really hard. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=71.0s)]
*  Well, you see people, by the way, and you see that they've made a decision. Like I met Sting and I go, okay, Sting at some point along the line decided I'm going to be like awesome. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=80.0s)]
*  Yeah. That's going to be my thing. I'm going to do yoga every day. Yeah, I'm going to come forever. He doesn't come. Right, he doesn't come. He holds his come. Yeah. He's like one of these guys. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=90.0s)]
*  No, what I'm saying is he was so nice when I met him that he released. Oh, wow. Interesting. Yeah. So sweet. I have it at home in my office with a little jar of Sting come. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=98.0s)]
*  When he goes, he probably really goes. I think, what is the deal with that tantric? That's why he says don't stand so close to me because he blasts you away. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=107.0s)]
*  The tantric thing, they're supposed to have an internal orgasm. Like they're supposed to absorb it internally. Right. I'm too lazy. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=115.0s)]
*  Well, it takes time. You have to like discipline yourself and then you can come forever, I guess. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=123.0s)]
*  It seems like you're thinking about your come too much. That does seem like it. Spending so much time doing that. A lot of time focused on come. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=129.0s)]
*  I mean, there's probably a benefit in it, but every benefit that you get off of something that's a difficult endeavor is a detriment to something else. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=135.0s)]
*  What do you think the detriment? Oh, just your mental energy. Just the amount of your time you're thinking about your jizz. It's fucking weird. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=143.0s)]
*  I mean, it's like, you know, I mean, I guess you could say that about a lot of things though, right? You could say that about like people who bodybuild. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=149.0s)]
*  You could say that about, you know, maybe you're thinking too much about one thing. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=157.0s)]
*  Well, I guess that's like kind of in a way that's what this this book that I just wrote is is about is about these like little book. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=162.0s)]
*  These little book, dude. Congratulations. Thank you very much. Very impressed and also very, very like proud of people who write books because I know this is a this is a fucking task, man. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=169.0s)]
*  It's an endeavor, but it's one that I like. A lot of standups really don't like it and they feel like it's homework. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=183.0s)]
*  I like I on stage. I do a lot of crowd work. That's kind of my thing. And this is the like creative opposite of crowd work. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=187.0s)]
*  It's not just your material. It's like, it's like mega your material. It's like you're you're you're a monk kind of creating a thing or whatever. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=196.0s)]
*  Like you should write a book. I have thought about it many times and I had a deal to write one once. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=204.0s)]
*  But as I was writing it, they were trying to get me to write it like stand up and they wanted me to write it in a way that like was funny like you'd be on stage. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=209.0s)]
*  Like how much laughs would you want per minute on stage, which I kind of don't really think about even stand up that much. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=218.0s)]
*  I just try to I cut out the bullshit. I edit things, you know, economy of words with bits. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=225.0s)]
*  But I don't think like how many laughs I have permit. They were like very specific about it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=231.0s)]
*  And then they said, how about this? Why don't you just transcribe your stand up? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=236.0s)]
*  And I was like, listen, I have a very different idea of what I want to write than you do. So I give you your money back. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=241.0s)]
*  Yeah, I gave him the money back and I said, I'm I'm just gonna if I'm going to write something, I'll write it on my own. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=246.0s)]
*  I did for a little while and then I stopped. But it was a lot of it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=252.0s)]
*  It was just like I only have so much time to write and I would rather write about ideas that I'm going to do on stage. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=255.0s)]
*  But I do have an idea about my I've been working on it a little bit lately. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=260.0s)]
*  So I'm thinking about actually going forward with this. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=265.0s)]
*  It's about my time when I was in my really early 20s and I discovered pool halls. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=267.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I saw the two pool tables. I didn't know you were a big pool guy. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=273.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm obsessed. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=276.0s)]
*  If I'm not if I'm like for like my empty my brain time, I watch professional pool matches. Is that right? Yeah. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=278.0s)]
*  Oh, interesting. You like I watch them. No, no, I hate that's bullshit bullshit. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=284.0s)]
*  Okay. That's what I was gonna say. What's cool. It's cool that you can do it, but I don't care. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=288.0s)]
*  Do you like that the Hustler? Oh, it's great. That's a good movie. That's a great movie. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=292.0s)]
*  That's a great movie. Just as a movie, you know, but the color money is as well. Are they connected? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=297.0s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. Same guy, Walter Tevis, who also wrote the Queen's Gambit. Oh, that amazing chess player. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=302.0s)]
*  She was an orphan. That's right. Yeah. That's a great series. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=309.0s)]
*  That series is really good. But that Walter Tevis guy was amazing. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=313.0s)]
*  He wrote the Hustler is really like a psychological drama as much as it is about pool. Yeah, I remember I saw it a long time ago. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=316.0s)]
*  I don't I don't quite remember it, but I remember it that it's great. Yeah. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=323.0s)]
*  Oh, it's I can I could literally say every word by heart at this pool hall that I used to hang around in White Plains, New York. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=326.0s)]
*  They used to play it on the television all the time in the pool hall in the pool. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=333.0s)]
*  Yeah, my friend Steve, who was the the the guy who ran the desk, who ran, you know, administered gave people the balls assigned your tables and stuff. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=338.0s)]
*  He used to just put that motherfucker on like every time we were there. We'd never get enough of that. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=347.0s)]
*  So what what was your thing? You go into the pool. How old were you? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=354.0s)]
*  I was like 20 when I really started playing. I think I was like 23 or 24 somewhere around then. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=358.0s)]
*  And it was just me and my friend John, who was also a comic. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=364.0s)]
*  We we went into this pool hall just for fun. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=367.0s)]
*  And, you know, we were just bored during the day. Well, let's go play pool. Neither one of us knew how to play pool. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=370.0s)]
*  We were terrible. You know, like we'd played a couple of times. Right. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=375.0s)]
*  And then we just stumbled into this pool hall that had this insane array of characters, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=378.0s)]
*  all these people that were criminals and hustlers and homeless people and people who lived in flop houses and people who were fucking insane gambling addicts that would bet on raindrops coming down a window. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=386.0s)]
*  Yeah. Bet on fucking anything, man. They want they just wanted action. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=403.0s)]
*  And you were teens walking in there. What's that? You guys were teenagers. No, no, we were about I was. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=407.0s)]
*  I was I was John's little older than me. I think I was 23 or 24 somewhere around then. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=412.0s)]
*  It's like, yeah, like 90. So, yeah, I was probably 23. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=417.0s)]
*  And I just remember thinking like this is a whole world that I didn't know existed. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=421.0s)]
*  This weird bachelor culture. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=426.0s)]
*  And apparently it emerged really in America in the early 1900s, the early 1900s in New York City. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=429.0s)]
*  There were hundreds and hundreds of pool halls, hundreds of them, and they were filled with these men that were disconnected from society. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=437.0s)]
*  A lot of them had like returned from wars. A lot of them had gotten out of prison and they were it was, you know, during the Depression, there was a lot of illegal activity and people did whatever the fuck they could. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=446.0s)]
*  And these men would gather in these pool halls and they were some of the wildest people I've ever encountered in my life. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=459.0s)]
*  I watched a guy who had just gotten out of jail play chess with his just with words, just saying where the pieces moved with a 16 year old kid who was a chess genius. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=466.0s)]
*  He wasn't even moving the pieces. He was no, there's no pieces. Oh, they were playing mind chess, mind chess. Oh, wow. I was like some commander data shit. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=479.0s)]
*  These are exceptional people that just happened to never plug into regular society. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=486.0s)]
*  What's like that dude in Malcolm X's autobiography, the guy that like he ran all the numbers in his mind and he never forgot a single one. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=492.0s)]
*  And Malcolm X said like he could have been like a mathematical genius or a statistical professor or whatever. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=499.0s)]
*  But instead he was like a hustler. He used that genius to be on the streets. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=505.0s)]
*  There's some people that have genius power that they apply to an art form, but they could have applied it to any like Jay Z. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=508.0s)]
*  Jay Z doesn't write any of his lyrics. Right. Right. If you read Jay Z's lyrics, they don't seem ad lib. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=515.0s)]
*  They seem like really well structured and written and and like funny and like sharp. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=520.0s)]
*  And there's so many of them like how how are you remembering all this? That's why people call me the Jay Z of comedy. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=527.0s)]
*  You've heard that before. You've never heard a person not say that about me. I haven't heard it yet. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=533.0s)]
*  It's coming down the pipe. It hasn't gotten here yet. You know, there's a pool hall in L.A., by the way. Really? There's almost none when I left. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=536.0s)]
*  There's one in K-Town that apparently that you go there. OK, that makes sense. You go. A lot of Koreans play pool. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=543.0s)]
*  Yeah, you walk in and there and you walk into one of them if you're white and they're like, uh-uh. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=548.0s)]
*  You're like, what? I want to play pool. They're like, uh-uh. Next. Next. Two doors down. They're all over here. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=554.0s)]
*  They're like, uh-uh. Well, they do whatever they want. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=559.0s)]
*  And then you walk down and that's where the white people are playing pool. But it's the same owner. Oh, that's hilarious. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=562.0s)]
*  But by the way, you cannot complain. No one will listen. Yeah. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=567.0s)]
*  If you're a fucking white guy and you can't get into a pool hall and they have a pool hall for white guys like, shut the fuck up, dude. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=570.0s)]
*  There's robberies going on. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got no time for you. People are shooting people. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=576.0s)]
*  LAPD. I was rejected access to a Korean pool hall. It feels very wrong. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=580.0s)]
*  Yes. I want someone to intervene immediately. This is horrible. I am a white male. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=586.0s)]
*  Like maybe if you work your way up through the pool tables in the white one, then they'll adopt you into the Korean one. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=591.0s)]
*  If they know you, maybe they're probably gambling. That's probably what a lot of it is. I would have a right word pool comes from pooling money together. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=597.0s)]
*  The game is called pocket billiards. It's not called pool. That's really interesting. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=605.0s)]
*  So it was just a gambling game for the people that had returned from. No, it was a game. Right. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=609.0s)]
*  But I think all games eventually evolve into gambling. Right. People gamble on basketball all the time. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=614.0s)]
*  People gamble on fights all the time. Like fighters will gamble against their opponents. People gamble. They like to gamble. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=622.0s)]
*  It makes things more exciting because now there's money on the line as well as pride and everything else. Are you allowed to bet on fights? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=629.0s)]
*  I am not. You are not allowed to. I am not allowed to. Now. When did that happen? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=636.0s)]
*  It's a recent rule that came about because apparently there is an allegation that one of the UFC trainers, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=641.0s)]
*  I want to be real clear about this because I actually like this guy a lot and I think he's a super talented trainer and I do not know if this is true. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=649.0s)]
*  So I won't even say his name, but one of these trainers was apparently aware of injuries and then informing a group of people online who are betting. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=655.0s)]
*  So they were saying like, hey, this guy's got something wrong with him. Right. He's not going to win this fight. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=667.0s)]
*  And then all the money would go on the opponent and then they would rake it in. And this happened allegedly on fighters that he was training or people that he knew. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=672.0s)]
*  It's like inside of stock trading. It's similar. Yeah. It's fishy also because it gives the possibility that fights or dives, you know, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=682.0s)]
*  when a coach is betting against their fighter or giving other people information against their fighter. If that happened. I don't know if it happened again. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=691.0s)]
*  I just want to be real clear. It's allegedly if that's the case, that's kind of like your it's next door neighbor to a dive. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=700.0s)]
*  And that is the last fucking thing we want in mixed martial arts is fixed fights. Right. Right. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=708.0s)]
*  Which is weird because it's owned by the same people who own WWE now. Right. It's kind of crazy. They've had a good week. It's a great week. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=714.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good week to be in the WWE. Oh, dude, that Vince McMahon is wild. That boy's out there. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=720.0s)]
*  I read this. I couldn't get through the text messages. I started trying to read them and I was like, I don't want to read. This is like poison. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=727.0s)]
*  But the thing is, when I see that dude with his shirt off, he's 80 years old, got a chain around his neck. What are you shocking me with this information? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=733.0s)]
*  Don't you think it takes a lot to get that guy going? You're saying he needed to send all those text messages to get aroused at that. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=742.0s)]
*  I think he probably needs a lot just for stimulation. Listen, he's a billionaire. Right. He's been running pro wrestling for fucking decades. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=748.0s)]
*  He's world famous CEO of this giant fucking multinational company, pro wrestling company. He's also in pro wrestling. Right. He gets out there and competes. He does it. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=757.0s)]
*  Yeah, I guess. You know, performs. At a certain point, I guess, if you're that through the looking glass of reality, like you become a heel in life. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=767.0s)]
*  Life is heel and everything is a match. Yeah. If you're going to be really successful at putting together pro wrestling, probably be pro wrestling all day long. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=775.0s)]
*  You got to stick with it. Yeah. Like stay in it all fucking day long. Don't go read Nietzsche at the end of the day. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=784.0s)]
*  Don't be reading Carl Jung's thoughts on flying saucers. Get the fuck out of here. Drink beer and go fuck. Yeah. That's what you should be doing. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=790.0s)]
*  You're on the road. I want you to Rick flair it until the fucking wheels come off. They do come off, too. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=799.0s)]
*  Yeah. On almost all of them. The only one who hasn't is the rock. Right. Rock is in remarkably great condition, obviously huge and massive and muscles and everything. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=804.0s)]
*  But mobile, he can do things like we worked out together. That's interesting. I wonder because he also seems like kind of the most. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=814.0s)]
*  He's one of those dudes who's got like what you're talking about genius level. He could have been anything. Sure. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=820.0s)]
*  He's kind of got one of those mega IQs feeling like. Well, he's got a mega disciplines. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=826.0s)]
*  What he has. Right. And if he applied that to intellectual endeavors, he would be a mega genius. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=830.0s)]
*  It's like I think we want to think that they're not connected, but I think they are. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=835.0s)]
*  And I think like Michael Jordan or someone who gets that good at basketball could get that good at anything. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=841.0s)]
*  It's just they don't apply themselves in that area because that's I think it's just exceptional people. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=846.0s)]
*  Well, you know, there's that weird idea. And apparently this is proven that the difference between a world championship runner and the number five is like less than a second. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=852.0s)]
*  Their speed. Right. I mean, the difference between the Olympian and the guy that doesn't make the podium is so it's just infinitesimally small. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=862.0s)]
*  And then the reason that the person wins is because they believe that it's not even a physiological thing. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=870.0s)]
*  It's like a confidence thing. Unless you're running against Usain Bolt. Right. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=876.0s)]
*  We'll take him out. We'll take him out. What you believe, because then there's genetics. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=881.0s)]
*  Genetics are real, too. Well, genetics is probably, I would guess, is what gets you to the to the stage in the first place. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=884.0s)]
*  It gets you on the track. It exists intellectually, too. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=890.0s)]
*  There's there's boundaries. I have limitations. I have certain limitations intellectually. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=892.0s)]
*  At a certain level, I just check out. Sure. I'm not going to be but I am friends with some insanely brilliant people that scare the shit out of you. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=898.0s)]
*  But if I talk to Eric Weinstein, I'm like, what are we even the same thing? Right. What are we? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=906.0s)]
*  We're not the we're barely the same thing. You know, when you really see that kind of genius is when they start talking to you in a way you'll understand. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=911.0s)]
*  You go, oh, so you wrote that book that I can't even comprehend. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=917.0s)]
*  But you're also conversationally able to help me try. You know, he does. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=920.0s)]
*  I try to tell him, like, you got to help us out here. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=925.0s)]
*  But but it's just because that's how he thinks and that's how he communicates. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=928.0s)]
*  It's like if like if you're going to talk about comedy to someone who doesn't do comedy, you'd probably just start talking like a comic. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=931.0s)]
*  Right. This is what we do. This is what I do. I'm not going to like I can't hold your hand too long. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=938.0s)]
*  You're 40 years old. Yeah. Just explain how I do it. Yeah. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=941.0s)]
*  Either get it or you don't get it. But I am. Well, I would on that pool thing, though. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=944.0s)]
*  That universe when you walked into that pool hall and saw like, bam, this is another universe. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=950.0s)]
*  Yeah. To me, like that is that's the experience of my life over and over again. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=956.0s)]
*  That is what the book is about is these like these momentary portals into another universe, you know, where somebody taps you on the shoulder and goes like, walk over here. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=961.0s)]
*  It's like Luke Skywalker. Right. Like he's this weak, powerless kid on Dantooine or whatever. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=970.0s)]
*  And and then all of a sudden Obi Wan Kenobi says it goes, look, there's a whole other universe here. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=975.0s)]
*  We show everybody your shoes because I think those are Luke Skywalker shoes. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=979.0s)]
*  That's what I was going to say. I love them. I couldn't remember the name of the planet, though, when you said Dantooine. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=982.0s)]
*  Oh, you think these are Dantooine shoes? Yeah, yeah, for sure. These are cool. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=990.0s)]
*  Joe came in and almost liked them. I felt pretty good about that. They're unusual. I love that you wear them. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=993.0s)]
*  They look great with white slacks or tan slacks. Those white or tan. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=998.0s)]
*  This is so close to a compliment. It's a compliment. You have a style. You have a certain style. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1002.0s)]
*  They're the most comfortable chain out to look at you chain out. Yeah, always chain out all day. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1007.0s)]
*  If I'm coming to if I'm coming to Joe Rogan, I'm taking the chain out. Let's freaking go. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1011.0s)]
*  I say let's freaking go for the kids. Yeah, let's friggin go. Let's go. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1016.0s)]
*  What's less offensive friggin or freaking? Like if you're around an old lady, I think freaking is more fun for an older lady. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1021.0s)]
*  Right. It's not offensive at all. Because she's an old freak herself. Maybe. She might just be an old freak. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1029.0s)]
*  She might be an old prude that hung in there. I've never understood the concept of censoring yourself for an older person. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1033.0s)]
*  They've heard the thing. Right, but the idea is that every generation gets more and more desensitized to bad words. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1039.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's fair. Which is 100% true. Yeah, I can see that. Like my kids say things that I would have never said in front of my parents. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1049.0s)]
*  Oh, in front of you. Yeah, but you're also you're you. So you've created a persona where swearing is it'd be funny for you to be uptight about swearing. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1056.0s)]
*  It is funny. I bet you did though. And you had little kids, right? No, I never was. My wife was a little bit, but not bad. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1063.0s)]
*  And I was like, listen, we have to just tell them that you can't say these words in front of other people, but they're just words. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1069.0s)]
*  Right. The only thing words are a sound you make. So I know what you're thinking. Right. It's all it is. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1076.0s)]
*  And to make words good or bad is fucking stupid. But there's a lot of things you're going to learn. They're stupid in the world. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1080.0s)]
*  But here's the rules. But in there around the house, they'll use them for funny. And it's hilarious. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1085.0s)]
*  It's like you're raising comics because we all talk like comics. They'll talk shit. You know, it's fun. Totally. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1091.0s)]
*  I had a conversation with my daughter the other day. I go I sat her down. I go, OK, honey, you're funny. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1097.0s)]
*  And with great power comes great responsibility. I go, you're going to have to figure out how to how to like where the line is. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1102.0s)]
*  Because people who are funny take it from me. Walk through the world offending people because they think they're being funny and they've gone like a step too far in personal interactions. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1108.0s)]
*  That's your job now. And it's also like when you're doing that, like people have to understand like why why would you have said that? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1115.0s)]
*  Like I didn't know I was going to say it while I was saying it completely. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1121.0s)]
*  Like there is a thing that you're doing when you're creating specifically when you're ad libbing where you if you're on stage or ad libbing, you are literally like you've got these missiles that are coming into silence. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1125.0s)]
*  They're coming into silos and you like, watch it. Yeah, launch it. Launch it. Like you're not even looking at the missile. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1137.0s)]
*  It's like your mind says maybe you can connect that to this go. And sometimes it's just like it's sometimes you're up on stage and you go, oh, I've oh, that was the end. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1142.0s)]
*  Yeah, I wish that that missile missile myself destroyed the village and everybody in it. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1154.0s)]
*  I've definitely had that experience. But yeah, there was a moment on my on my my crowd work album, Crowdsurfing, where I heard myself when I was listening back to it. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1160.0s)]
*  I was riffing one riff and in that riff switched back and did the better riff. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1169.0s)]
*  Like that's a pretty speaking of like the way the brain works. It's like a hone. That's a honed brain that comics have. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1173.0s)]
*  Well, you've got that. You've done that exercise over and over and over and over again. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1180.0s)]
*  So he gets like super comfortable in that pocket of crowd work. Like Big Jay Okerton is amazing at that. One of the best. He's one of the best ever at that. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1184.0s)]
*  He's just so Andrew Schultz is as well. They're just so comfortable. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1194.0s)]
*  There's a fucking hilarious one that Schultz just put out of he's talking to some guy in the audience who brought a date and the date turns out to be a trans woman. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1197.0s)]
*  And it's just hilarious. But fun, lighthearted, positive. It's really cool. It's very skillfully done. Right. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1206.0s)]
*  You know, it's a skin and the whole audience loved it. It was like they loved it. It was it was great. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1217.0s)]
*  Well, that's how I think of crowd work when it goes really well. Everybody's having a good time. Yes. It's like a gift. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1223.0s)]
*  It's like a gift to the crowd because they know in their mind I will this moment will not be this was for me. Right. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1227.0s)]
*  This was a gift this comic gave me tonight and it will never exist again except in tick tock form. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1233.0s)]
*  Hopefully it'll go viral a million times forever. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1238.0s)]
*  I always think about that when everybody's blowing up on these crowd work clips is like how many magical moments. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1242.0s)]
*  But there's something beautiful about this, too. How many magical moments you you offered on stage in the pre digital kind of upload everything era where you're just like it was just momentary. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1247.0s)]
*  It was just an offering to that moment. Yeah. There's something really beautiful about that. I love that. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1257.0s)]
*  I think that's like it's important. I think the artificial reality of digital life. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1262.0s)]
*  There's certain people that want to fucking film everything. They want to film every conversation they have. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1271.0s)]
*  Look, I'm here with this. Let's let's put this on the gram. We tag me in this like stop. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1277.0s)]
*  It's it's a wild. You got to live. I saw a guy the other day. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1282.0s)]
*  His thing is he goes to fine dining restaurants and screams at the top of his lungs. That's his that's his career. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1285.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. See the guy that got arrested that was just dumping shit on people. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1291.0s)]
*  Now that I respect he dumped a whole bucket of shit on some guy that was like on a train just shit on down his back. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1296.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then what he said, it's a prank. It's like a kid. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1304.0s)]
*  And you know, I mean, I think we were talking about it. I said, I think it might be bioterrorism because there's something like shit. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1308.0s)]
*  Human shit is like really dangerous. That is definitely biohazard. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1315.0s)]
*  Sure. Like humans are gross like our fucking gut bacteria. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1319.0s)]
*  If that gets in a cut, human shit gets in a cut. You better wash the fuck out of that. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1323.0s)]
*  Talk about going viral. What we're going viral. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1328.0s)]
*  This joke is landing exactly where I wanted it to. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1331.0s)]
*  Viruses. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1334.0s)]
*  Literally, please don't write in. That's where plague comes from. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1337.0s)]
*  Early days, it was a lot of it was like terrible hygiene and terrible sanitation and no running water. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1341.0s)]
*  So people are just shitting the streets. They're shitting in buckets and throwing up the street. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1347.0s)]
*  There's human feces everywhere. You know why people think perhaps the Jews didn't suffer as much in plague other than conspiracy theories that they started it during the Black Plague. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1351.0s)]
*  There was a conspiracy. There's way back then they did it. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1362.0s)]
*  I'm I'm pretty sure. Yes. I don't know where that rumor would have come from. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1365.0s)]
*  So how did they survive it? So Jews when they eat a meal, every single meal with bread, always wash their hands. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1369.0s)]
*  It's a part of the ritual. It's a ritualistic thing. You wash your hands before you eat bread. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1376.0s)]
*  And and people didn't really do that because germ theory wasn't people didn't know what germ theory. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1380.0s)]
*  They didn't understand the correlation between washing your hands and eating. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1386.0s)]
*  And so Jews would always wash your hand before every meal. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1389.0s)]
*  And that is how apparently they they sidestep some of the ravages of the plague. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1391.0s)]
*  Do you think that that a lot of the religious rules like washing your hands, it has to be based on some ancient understanding of where diseases come from? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1396.0s)]
*  Like think about no pork. Right. Right. The trichinosis. Yeah. Yeah. It's ubiquitous in porks. Right. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1409.0s)]
*  And porks and pigs and pigs and bears in mountain lions. They all have it like it's like a giant percentage of bears have it. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1416.0s)]
*  A giant percentage of pigs have especially wild pigs. So that would prevent you from ever getting that. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1424.0s)]
*  Let's just say no one eat pig. The simple way. Don't cook it to one hundred forty seven degrees. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1429.0s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck that means. I don't know when the right way to cook it. It kills people. Right. Let's stop eating that. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1433.0s)]
*  And then shellfish. Same deal. Red tide. All sorts of other bacteria that you would about mixing linens and wools or whatever. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1438.0s)]
*  That's a weird one. But like the the shellfish one, people dive oysters are just read about someone dying from a raw oyster. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1445.0s)]
*  It's super rare. I still eat them. Yeah. Which is a really stupid thing to do. You know, like eating oysters if they can fucking every one out of a million people gets whacked by an oyster. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1453.0s)]
*  I didn't I did not know that. Yeah. Somebody died just recently. My kid is like rethinking my oyster consumption. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1463.0s)]
*  My kid leads live sea urchin. Well, she's more adventurous than I am. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1469.0s)]
*  Straight out of the straight out of the carcass. Yeah, it's moving a little bit. That's my favorite sushi. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1475.0s)]
*  Man dies after contracting vibro vulnicious bacteria from fresh oysters in Texas. It's right here. Oh, shit. You're going to know you're good. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1480.0s)]
*  The consumption of raw oysters at a Texas restaurant led to an untimely death of a relatively healthy relative is a weird word for a dude in his 30s. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1489.0s)]
*  You know, we're talking about here. Relatively healthy. What are you trying to say? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1497.0s)]
*  A lot of editorial from the USA. Relatively healthy. I wouldn't say. Hold on, Jamie. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1502.0s)]
*  The man contracted a bacterial infection known as vibro vulnicious. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1507.0s)]
*  Vola vulnicious is my favorite techno DJ. It sounds like a good one. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1513.0s)]
*  Like from like Germany or somewhere that thrives in warm coastal waters. So it's like local bacteria. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1519.0s)]
*  I think you're good, though, Joe. If he died and said it's one every every every million oyster, he ate the oyster. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1525.0s)]
*  It's probably more than one every million. Oh, look, the guy lost his toes. Oh, this is not good. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1532.0s)]
*  I do not want vibro vulcan. The fuck is it a flesh eating bacteria? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1537.0s)]
*  Those are weird. You hear about those in the news every now and again. Fresh flesh. Ah, it is a fucking flesh eating bacteria. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1542.0s)]
*  God damn it. I heard about those. I don't want one. No, that's my official stance on this. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1549.0s)]
*  I heard about a kid that ate a slug as a dare. You read that story? Paralyzed in Australia. Super brutal. Oh, horrible. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1554.0s)]
*  And then you start. I warned my kid. I go, don't eat slugs. But it's like she's going to do some other terrible thing that I can't think of. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1561.0s)]
*  Right. You never can protect them fully nor should you. That's the unfortunate thing. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1567.0s)]
*  It's like you've got to experience a certain amount of like falling down. Right. It's part of the process. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1572.0s)]
*  I just but I did tell don't eat slugs. Don't eat slugs. The other day we were on the beach though and my neighbor had a lobster trap out and and he took out his lobster trap and he was undoing it. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1577.0s)]
*  And there was this undulating piece of seaweed. I think there's something alive in there and we shook it off and it was a full giant octopus. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1587.0s)]
*  It was the coolest. And my kid reached in and grabbed the octopus like just like it was her friend. She was like baby octopus. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1595.0s)]
*  And they will bite the fuck out of you. That's what we found out. Every octopus is venomous. She didn't get bit. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1603.0s)]
*  Every octopus is venomous and not most of them can't kill you. But every one of them has a beak that will fuck you up. Yeah, they're all beak. But he was very cool. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1608.0s)]
*  Do you know how they kill them when they catch them? No, they bite their heads. Who? Who they? Fishermen. They physically bite them? Fishermen physically bite their head like right where the brain stem is and then they change color. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1616.0s)]
*  That's how you know they're dead. They become pink. They come white. Whoa. Yeah, they just when you see an octopus in the wild, you ever seen how well they can camouflage themselves? Yeah, totally fucking insane. Yeah, it's great. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1627.0s)]
*  Texture everything they can look exactly like whatever the fuck they're near, whether it's coral or rubble on the ground. They literally blend in. It's insane. It's amazing. But when you bite them, all that shit goes away. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1638.0s)]
*  You like me. Yes. Do you have any like weird feelings about like an animal at a certain level of intelligence? Yes. Like octopus to me. I don't eat a monkey. Right. Well, a monkey is. Yeah, that's very intense. Yeah. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1651.0s)]
*  See, watch. He's going to bite the octopus. So this guy caught this octopus and he's going to bite it. See where he bites it. And then the thing immediately goes. He bites it like right where the eyeballs are. And then it immediately dies. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1664.0s)]
*  This is the system by which you get octopus at a restaurant is just some guy. I do not think so. Brain stem of an octopus. I do not know. But I think this is just individuals that are sport fishing. They're doing it for food. They're just getting that octopus delicious. They're smart though, aren't they? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1676.0s)]
*  Too smart. Yeah, it bothers me like you're eating an alien. I feel like I might stop eating octopus. There's animals that are really pigs are really fucking right. Pigs are smart. They're really smart. Right. That's where it starts to get weird because it's weird. So crows crows will bring you gifts and they'll warn you that the cops are coming. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1691.0s)]
*  There's this guy found this crow. It was in the water. Maybe the guy might have been a woman. I'm not sure. But anyway, there was some TikTok video about it. And this person found this crow, picked it up at the paddle. It was in the water like drowning, put it in the boat and then took it home and nursed it back to health. And then the crow would just hang out with her. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1708.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're loyal. They were petting the crow with a brush and she put the brush back on the shelf. Then the crow flew over the shelf, grabbed the brush, brought it back and said, no, no, keep petting me. Really, it's really cool. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1728.0s)]
*  There's like a whole mechanism on how to get the crow to like you too. Really? You start doing a certain, I think it's leaving it gifts and then it will go, oh, this person gives gifts. Then it will start bringing you gifts. And then if you keep going, it will start attacking your enemies. Yes. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1741.0s)]
*  Your neighbors will come over and be like, what's up, Joe? And then the crow will come down and attack. Yeah, this guy, Dan Flores, who's on the podcast before, had essentially trained a crow by leaving it food every day. And he would go on a walk with his dog and the crow would hang out with them. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1756.0s)]
*  Would it fly? It would fly next to him? Oh, yeah, fly right next to him and hang out with them and plop down and it would go looking for him. I liked him. I had a friend who was a falconer. Do you know about these guys? I'm sure you do. Do you know how they catch them? It's crazy. No. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1770.0s)]
*  Well, basically they catch them in the wild. They like leave some food out and they catch them with a trap in the wild. But then they take them home. This blew my mind. They take them home and they put them in a dark room for like multiple days. And they walk into the dark room with one of those weird gauntlets or whatever that are made by the same people that make my boots. And they have just meat on their hand and they just sit there for hours in a dark room with an owl or a hawk or whatever. And they just sit there for hours in a dark room with an owl or a hawk or whatever. And they just sit there for hours in a dark room with an owl or a hawk or whatever. And they just sit there for hours in a dark room with an owl or a hawk or whatever. And they just sit there for hours in a dark room with an owl or a hawk or whatever. And they just sit there for hours in a dark room with an owl or a hawk or whatever. And they [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1782.0s)]
*  And over the course of a week, the bird will get closer and closer and then start nibbling and then start eating. And at that point, it's yours. And now it's now it's your Falcon. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1812.0s)]
*  Whoa, isn't that crazy? So just rewires their brain? Yeah, to be like this guy's got the food. So when so now when he lets me go to hunt for the rat or whatever, I'll come back to the gauntlet. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1823.0s)]
*  Look at this crazy trap they use to get them. Huh? And every Falcon that a Falconer has is caught captured in the wild. Really? They're not like bread or whatever. They just capture them and then they do this weird thing where they train them and then they let them go after a few years of service. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1834.0s)]
*  When I was in Scotland, there's this lady who was she trained a variety of birds, but she trained owls and Falcons. And so she had a Falcon there. And she said the problem with the Falcon is when they let it go, it just fucks things up. It just flies. It just finds another bird and kills it like she like every time she lets go find something kills it. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1849.0s)]
*  It's just like an it's violent. Oh, it's the worst. It's a monster. Right? It's just a killing machine. It doesn't matter if it's hungry or not. It's flying around looking to fuck things up. She said the owl is the second dumbest bird in the wild. Really? Yeah. And that crazy. How did they get the wise thing? They someone is got a good PR agent and they just they got ahead of it. Owl baby. It's me. Owls are dumb. She said owls are dumb. She said the really smart. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1867.0s)]
*  The smart ones are like like Falcons are very smart crows are the smartest. But the only thing's dumber than an owl is emus. Emus are dumber. They're so big, you think that they would have big brains. They don't have to be right. There's shut the fuck up. Give me the food. Right. Right. So big. They are freaks. I would say freaks of nature. They shouldn't exist. The emu. Have you eaten emu? No. Have you? No. But I think people do. They eat it. They eat ostrich. I've had ostrich. Isn't it? Fuddruckers. Fuddruckers? They have ostrich? Fuddruckers used to serve an ostrich. They used to serve an ostrich. They used to serve an ostrich. They used to serve an ostrich. They used to serve an ostrich. They used to serve an ostrich. They used to serve an ostrich. They used to serve an ostrich. They [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1897.0s)]

*  I think elk. I think elk is the most delicious. That's my favorite. That's my favorite. Yeah. But there's a lot of really good ones. Yeah. But there's a lot of really good ones. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=1932.36s)]
*  Axis deer which are very prevalent here in Texas. They're from India. They're really delicious. Yeah, but bison bison is very delicious. They're very lean. Like if you're gonna eat just those things you got to make sure you get an adequate amount of fats along with them. You eat moose? I eat moose. What's up with moose?

*  the last few years, things have gotten a little bit weird. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2109.44s)]

*  because she didn't want like a hardcore one. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2120.0s)]

*  Damn, I should have kept those balls. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2146.64s)]
*  I didn't do it. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2147.46s)]
*  Especially when they're young. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2148.2999999999997s)]
*  If you get them real young and they're fixed. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2149.14s)]
*  I had a dog that was fixed when he was a baby, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2150.08s)]
*  somehow or another. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2152.4s)]

*  He had no testosterone as he was growing, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2164.42s)]
*  which is just not good for a male dog. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2167.44s)]
*  There's a lot of arguments that it's, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2169.56s)]
*  look, it's irresponsible to let your dog [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2171.54s)]
*  have a bunch of puppies. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2173.08s)]
*  And then, you know, so if you're letting your dog out [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2174.32s)]
*  and your dog is fucking other dogs [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2177.2000000000003s)]
*  and getting them pregnant and getting, yeah, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2178.7200000000003s)]
*  that's irresponsible. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2180.78s)]
*  But my dog's not fixed and he doesn't go out. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2182.12s)]
*  If he interacts with dogs, it's my friend's dogs. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2185.32s)]
*  You know, we play in the yard. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2188.2400000000002s)]
*  I take him for walks. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2189.52s)]
*  He doesn't get loose to go fuck a dog. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2190.48s)]
*  It's not irresponsible. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2192.6400000000003s)]

*  He's never fucked. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2195.32s)]
*  Oh, that's cruel in a different way. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2196.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm afraid he would find out about it [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2198.0800000000004s)]
*  and then he would never shut the fuck up. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2199.32s)]

*  That's a different kind of meanness though. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2212.42s)]
*  You let it keep the balls, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2213.54s)]

*  Well, they can't not come. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2216.94s)]

*  Right, right. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2222.66s)]
*  It's not like humans where it's funsies. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2223.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2225.46s)]

*  We should make a dog condom. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2237.74s)]
*  It's not gonna work. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2239.9s)]
*  No, we should put it on. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2241.1s)]
*  If you love your dog and you want it to get laid, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2242.3s)]
*  slip it on. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2244.46s)]
*  Well, you can give your dog birth control, I guess. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2245.3s)]
*  Really? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2247.3s)]
*  Yeah, but that would probably fuck the female dog up. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2248.1400000000003s)]
*  It fucks women up. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2249.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2251.1400000000003s)]
*  Birth control's terrible for women. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2251.98s)]
*  They've been telling women to take birth control forever. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2253.46s)]
*  Birth control does all sorts of wacky things [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2255.9s)]
*  to the way you perceive people. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2258.6000000000004s)]
*  I have a friend and his daughter died. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2262.1800000000003s)]
*  She had a stroke because she had a blood clot [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2264.82s)]
*  that is apparently one of the side effects [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2268.3s)]
*  of smoking cigarettes and taking birth control. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2270.36s)]
*  It's possible to have that happen. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2272.96s)]
*  And she died that way. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2274.96s)]
*  She was like 17 years old. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2275.84s)]
*  It's like, it's this tricky medication. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2277.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's great that women got their liberation sexually [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2279.6s)]
*  and that every time you had sex, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2282.76s)]
*  it wasn't like you're gonna have a baby [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2284.1600000000003s)]
*  that you could choose when to do it, when not to do it. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2286.32s)]
*  But. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2288.48s)]
*  Does that fuck your perception up too, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2289.4s)]
*  having a kid at 16? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2290.6800000000003s)]
*  100%. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2291.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2293.08s)]
*  Listen, there's arguments for both sides of it. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2293.92s)]
*  And they put some girls on birth control for their acne, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2297.08s)]
*  to control acne. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2299.72s)]
*  I've heard about that. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2300.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2301.6s)]
*  So it's like, it's not saying that birth control [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2302.4399999999996s)]
*  is entirely bad, but if you're a woman [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2304.2799999999997s)]
*  and you have to take this thing in order to not get pregnant [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2307.16s)]
*  and the guy doesn't have to do shit. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2311.04s)]
*  You know, like the guy, like if a guy had to take, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2313.04s)]
*  if a birth control pill was invented for a guy, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2315.3199999999997s)]
*  and I think they did come up with one, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2317.56s)]
*  but it radically lowers your testosterone. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2319.66s)]
*  It'll be like my dog. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2322.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2323.12s)]
*  It'll just be like a really sweet little bitch. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2323.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah, probably kills your sperm cells. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2325.8399999999997s)]
*  It's probably the only way it would work. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2328.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2329.72s)]
*  So the way to kill your sperm cells [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2330.56s)]
*  would be either to ramp up your endogenous testosterone [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2332.16s)]
*  to where your body doesn't produce testosterone anymore, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2336.16s)]
*  so you don't produce sperm cells, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2339.7999999999997s)]
*  or you could kill it. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2342.0s)]
*  Kill the sperm cells, kill the testosterone, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2344.94s)]
*  and kill everything. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2347.56s)]
*  They turn you into just a feeble version of yourself. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2348.4s)]
*  Well, that's why. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2352.4s)]
*  Tired all the time. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2353.24s)]
*  That's what I came on this podcast to talk about [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2354.2s)]
*  is mandated vasectomies for teenagers, teenage boys, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2356.0s)]
*  and I think this will go over really well. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2359.12s)]
*  Yeah, as long as you can reverse it. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2360.98s)]
*  Are we the ones that can be reversed? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2363.72s)]
*  Yeah, we can be reversed. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2365.6s)]
*  We're good, women's not good. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2366.44s)]
*  Obviously, women get their unuses removed. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2368.04s)]
*  With a dude, they can reverse it, but it's not 100%. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2370.6s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2375.16s)]
*  You know, you might have to do it a couple of times [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2376.0s)]
*  to make it stick. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2377.48s)]
*  People are getting into that now. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2378.32s)]
*  Vasectomies are having a moment right now. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2379.84s)]
*  Ari got one of them. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2381.6s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2382.52s)]
*  Yep. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2383.36s)]
*  I mean, good for him, I get that. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2384.2s)]
*  You're gonna be single and you don't want kids? [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2385.18s)]
*  Like why not? [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2387.22s)]
*  I think Stan Hope did it too, yeah. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2388.06s)]
*  That's like a psychic permanent condom. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2389.98s)]
*  And with no condoms. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2392.74s)]
*  Yeah, and then you don't, if you have a wife, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2394.7s)]
*  she doesn't worry about birth control anymore. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2397.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2399.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2400.14s)]
*  I would not, that would terrify me. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2400.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's a tricky operation. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2403.46s)]
*  It's a dick operation. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2405.34s)]
*  And in time, you're operating on your nether regions. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2407.18s)]
*  You're like, what? [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2409.5s)]
*  I mean, it does sound like a terrifying proposition. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2412.02s)]
*  Put you under and operate on your balls. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2414.14s)]
*  And then you wake up and they've castrated you [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2415.98s)]
*  and you go, things went a little bit wrong. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2418.02s)]
*  Yeah, it went sideways. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2419.46s)]
*  Unfortunately, you don't have balls. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2420.94s)]
*  The doctor had a psychotic break and just started chopping. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2422.74s)]
*  Well, you know about that story [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2427.7s)]
*  of the guy who amputated the wrong limb? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2428.54s)]
*  Oh! [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2430.98s)]
*  Because apparently they write in Sharpie on your limb, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2433.2999999999997s)]
*  like this one. Oh, god damn it. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2435.3399999999997s)]
*  This one off and then he did the wrong one. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2436.54s)]
*  Christ. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2439.18s)]
*  It's funny, you remember that it's like, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2440.02s)]
*  it's just a person up there. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2441.8199999999997s)]
*  I know a guy whose wife had the wrong kidney removed. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2444.78s)]
*  Oh, that's crazy. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2448.54s)]
*  That's a death sentence. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2449.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, what the fuck did you just do? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2451.06s)]
*  And the doctor did not want to admit fault. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2455.46s)]
*  The whole story's so crazy. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2458.5s)]
*  Was the kidney that was remained? [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2459.82s)]
*  The doctor didn't want to apologize. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2461.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh, that's crazy. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2462.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, kidney that remained was fucked. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2463.5800000000004s)]
*  It was a bad kidney. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2464.98s)]
*  Yeah, that was the one they were supposed to take out. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2465.82s)]
*  They took out the good one. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2467.3s)]
*  Would you ever donate a kidney? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2469.06s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I would to save someone's life, yeah. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2470.3s)]
*  I know people that have done it. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2473.3s)]
*  Yeah, it sounds really intense. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2474.42s)]
*  Apparently you can survive on one kidney. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2476.2200000000003s)]
*  The liver is the craziest one. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2478.46s)]
*  We were just talking about that the other day. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2479.7400000000002s)]
*  If you donate half your liver to me, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2481.38s)]
*  if you and I have the same blood type, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2483.5s)]
*  within six to eight weeks, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2485.6200000000003s)]
*  your liver will have returned to full size, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2487.0600000000004s)]
*  and my liver that you donated, that you gave me, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2489.78s)]
*  will be full size as well. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2492.3s)]
*  It feels like they could cure liver cancer [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2494.2200000000003s)]
*  by just doing elective half a liver in a lab growth, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2496.78s)]
*  and then we just. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2501.1400000000003s)]
*  Well, they're gonna eventually be able to do that, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2502.06s)]
*  I would imagine. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2503.58s)]
*  They're already looking into [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2504.5s)]
*  some sort of reconstruction of organs. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2506.98s)]
*  To be able to create a completely new heart [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2509.7s)]
*  that's made out of your own tissue [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2511.66s)]
*  so that your body doesn't reject it, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2512.7799999999997s)]
*  because your body rejects other people's tissue. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2515.62s)]
*  So if you gave me a heart, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2518.58s)]
*  I would have to take the crazy medication [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2520.54s)]
*  to make sure that my body didn't reject that heart. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2522.98s)]
*  Have you heard that? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2525.7s)]
*  There's a documentary about that guy [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2526.54s)]
*  that was putting artificial tracheas in people. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2527.9s)]
*  Oh, this is good, or bad, it's horrifying. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2530.8199999999997s)]
*  It was this genius doctor that was putting in these, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2532.8999999999996s)]
*  he had this breakthrough [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2535.2999999999997s)]
*  that you could just replace a trachea [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2538.3599999999997s)]
*  with a plastic tracheal tube, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2540.3399999999997s)]
*  and bathe it in stem cells, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2542.66s)]
*  and it would eventually, I don't know what, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2544.74s)]
*  meld into your body's DNA tissue [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2547.02s)]
*  and just become a part of your body. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2550.66s)]
*  But he was making it up. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2552.2999999999997s)]
*  It did not ever, it did not work one time. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2554.18s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2556.8999999999996s)]
*  But he was just flying around the world, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2557.74s)]
*  it's like medical master. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2559.14s)]
*  They're going, this genius, the genius of our time, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2560.98s)]
*  winning Nobel prizes and stuff, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2563.5s)]
*  and just people were dying left and right, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2565.3599999999997s)]
*  because they were just putting a fucking tube [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2567.7s)]
*  into people's throat instead of a trachea. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2569.74s)]
*  Oh my God, oh my God. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2571.42s)]
*  How many did he do before they got him? [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2573.94s)]
*  It was like a half a dozen or something like that. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2575.9s)]
*  Yeah, it was really not. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2577.98s)]
*  So he's just an insane person. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2579.3799999999997s)]
*  In this weird way? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2581.18s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of what we were talking about earlier. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2582.3399999999997s)]
*  He was a genius, but he was like a mad, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2583.7799999999997s)]
*  he'd become a mad genius. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2586.02s)]
*  He just blew a fuse. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2587.2599999999998s)]
*  He blew a fuse, yeah, and he thought, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2588.5s)]
*  I have an idea, there's no way my idea won't work [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2590.46s)]
*  if I just do it enough times. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2592.98s)]
*  Oh yeah, Macarena. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2595.3s)]
*  And simultaneously, he was hustling a woman [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2597.54s)]
*  like he was pretending to be married [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2601.62s)]
*  to a journalist in America, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2603.26s)]
*  and then he was already married in Italy. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2605.2s)]
*  So he was like, kind of had two different [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2607.38s)]
*  mad man thing going on at once. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2608.8s)]
*  He's a wild dude. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2610.86s)]
*  Swedish Appealed Court convicted Macarena on Wednesday [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2612.02s)]
*  and sentenced him to two and a half years in prison. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2616.26s)]
*  That's it? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2618.7799999999997s)]
*  That's pretty crazy. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2620.06s)]
*  Sweden. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2620.9s)]
*  Once there's a wall up where you're a medical professional, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2621.8199999999997s)]
*  I guess there is a little bit of an arms leg. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2624.3399999999997s)]
*  I mean, these people did know they were doing [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2625.9s)]
*  an experimental surgery and that they could die, I guess, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2627.7799999999997s)]
*  but they didn't know that it definitely wouldn't work. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2631.42s)]
*  But they obviously decided that he did something wrong. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2633.66s)]
*  They put him in jail for two and a half years. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2636.62s)]
*  Yeah, this guy was a wild one. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2639.1s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2641.18s)]
*  Compulsive liar, spinning wild stories, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2642.18s)]
*  and manipulating a woman who became his fiance. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2643.9s)]
*  The Appealed Court ruled that two of the three patients [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2646.92s)]
*  who died did not require emergency intervention. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2649.48s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2651.96s)]
*  That was the part I forgot. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2652.8s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2653.92s)]
*  This is the most fucked up part, Joe. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2655.16s)]
*  It kept failing on sick people that needed new tracheas. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2656.76s)]
*  So he was like, what I need to do [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2660.6800000000003s)]
*  is find a relatively healthy person [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2662.12s)]
*  that has a tracheal issue, like a collapsed trachea [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2664.64s)]
*  or something where they're still walking through the world [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2667.2400000000002s)]
*  with relative health, like the oyster guy, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2669.96s)]
*  and I'll put it in them and that will prove [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2673.1800000000003s)]
*  that the thing works. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2674.98s)]
*  Oh my God, what a psycho. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2675.86s)]
*  Is that him? [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2677.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's him. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2678.5800000000004s)]
*  That looks like a psycho. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2679.42s)]
*  It looks like George Clooney if he got really fat [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2680.26s)]
*  and did a lot of opium. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2682.1400000000003s)]
*  What a psycho. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2683.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2687.46s)]
*  Did you do it on relatively healthy people [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2688.3s)]
*  just to prove that it works? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2690.02s)]
*  And it completely did not. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2691.7200000000003s)]
*  So he literally went on a worldwide quest [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2693.7000000000003s)]
*  to find somebody with a fucked up trachea [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2696.06s)]
*  but that wasn't sick and found someone like that [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2698.1000000000004s)]
*  and she was cosmetic for her. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2701.6600000000003s)]
*  And she's like, I'm tired of talking like this [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2703.78s)]
*  and I have to have a scarf on and okay, I'll do it. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2706.5s)]
*  She didn't like the way her trachea looked? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2708.5s)]
*  No, I think she talked weird and she had issues for sure. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2710.2599999999998s)]
*  But it was not life or death. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2714.3799999999997s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2716.3399999999997s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2717.5s)]
*  There's some psychos out there, man. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2718.3399999999997s)]
*  Some of them happen to be doctors. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2719.58s)]
*  Just because someone went to medical school [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2721.54s)]
*  doesn't mean they're not crazy. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2723.02s)]
*  No, I listened to that Dr. Death podcast. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2724.2599999999998s)]
*  You ever hear that? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2727.2599999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2728.1s)]
*  It's about a guy who was a neurosurgeon [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2728.92s)]
*  and he was just like, it wasn't clear [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2730.3999999999996s)]
*  if he was like Dr. Mangala wanted to kill people [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2732.46s)]
*  or if he was just like a stupid person [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2735.12s)]
*  that was just like slashing in people's bodies. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2736.92s)]
*  It wasn't clear what he was doing [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2739.6s)]
*  but it looked like when you'd open someone up, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2741.16s)]
*  he had no idea what he was doing. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2743.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, he just was like stapling an artery to a bone. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2744.92s)]
*  He just like, and- [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2748.04s)]
*  Just for fun? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2749.96s)]
*  Nobody really knows. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2751.12s)]
*  But he was a real surgeon. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2751.96s)]
*  He was a real neurosurgeon. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2753.12s)]
*  And until I heard that podcast, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2754.6s)]
*  it would have never occurred to me to go to a surgeon [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2755.7599999999998s)]
*  and then look him up. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2758.72s)]
*  I'm sure you are savvy enough to do that [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2760.96s)]
*  but I would have just been like, you're a doctor. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2762.8399999999997s)]
*  You must know things. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2764.8s)]
*  Okay, open up my brain stem and get in there. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2766.04s)]
*  Yeah, the first time I got surgery, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2768.2000000000003s)]
*  I had no idea anything about the doctor's credentials [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2769.84s)]
*  and I don't know anything about him now. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2773.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2775.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't even remember his name. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2776.52s)]
*  He put me under and opened me up [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2777.34s)]
*  and drilled holes in my bones and- [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2778.52s)]
*  Yeah, now I heard that, I would always Google. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2780.7200000000003s)]
*  I would go deeper. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2783.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2785.04s)]
*  You can't be fucking entirely sure [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2785.88s)]
*  that someone's not out of their mind. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2787.88s)]
*  Well, there's certain professions like that [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2789.36s)]
*  where you assume their degree is the thing [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2792.96s)]
*  that makes them competent [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2794.92s)]
*  but you forget that it's just a person. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2796.28s)]
*  Here's the guy, it says, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2798.6s)]
*  of the 37 patients, Duncht, how do you say it? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2799.6s)]
*  Duncht. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2802.36s)]
*  Oh, Duncht, yeah, David Duncht. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2803.2s)]
*  Duncht operated on Endowus over about two years. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2804.68s)]
*  33 were hurt or harmed in the process. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2807.92s)]
*  33. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2810.4s)]
*  33 out of 37. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2811.2400000000002s)]
*  That is a bad record. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2812.06s)]
*  Four people skated clean. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2812.9s)]
*  Some people woke up paralyzed. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2814.48s)]
*  Others emerged from anesthesia [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2816.52s)]
*  to permanent pain and nerve damage, from nerve damage. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2818.08s)]
*  Two patients died, one from significant blood loss [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2821.16s)]
*  after the operation and the other from a stroke [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2823.8799999999997s)]
*  caused by a cut vertebral artery. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2826.6s)]
*  Wow. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2830.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was just slashing. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2831.96s)]
*  He was in there just mashing it up, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2833.6s)]
*  kind of like preschool style. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2835.3199999999997s)]
*  Look at this one. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2836.48s)]
*  One patient, a childhood friend of Duncht, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2837.3199999999997s)]
*  went in for a spinal operation with someone he trusted [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2839.06s)]
*  and woke up a quadriplegic [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2841.7599999999998s)]
*  after the doctor damaged his vertebral artery. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2843.96s)]
*  That was his childhood best friend. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2848.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2850.6s)]
*  Turn him into a quadriplegic. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2851.68s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2853.6s)]
*  Yeah, there's psychos out there, man. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2856.04s)]
*  Is that him? [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2857.84s)]
*  That's the guy that plays him in the TV show? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2858.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2861.44s)]
*  That's Josh Jackson from... [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2862.2799999999997s)]
*  Let's get a real photo of this boy up here. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2863.92s)]
*  There was another doctor death. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2864.7599999999998s)]
*  There was a guy who created execution machines. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2866.56s)]
*  There was a documentary about him. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2870.68s)]
*  It's a crazy documentary [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2871.88s)]
*  because at the end he kind of gets hoodwinked [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2873.7999999999997s)]
*  into becoming a Holocaust denier. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2875.88s)]
*  Oh, I know about this guy. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2878.64s)]
*  I keep tabs on all of them. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2881.32s)]
*  Yeah, I think he's gone now, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2883.2400000000002s)]
*  but I think at the end of his life, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2886.04s)]
*  he was somehow or another brought to Auschwitz [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2888.96s)]
*  or one of the other concentration camps. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2893.6400000000003s)]
*  I remember this guy, yes. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2896.88s)]
*  And he said that this could not have been... [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2898.1200000000003s)]
*  It's impossible that Zyklon B could have... [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2900.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I saw this documentary. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2902.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh, it was Errol Morris' film. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2905.88s)]
*  Yeah, I remember this guy. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2907.2400000000002s)]
*  So what was his assertion? [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2909.38s)]
*  He claims he was invited to other American prisons, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2910.9s)]
*  expected design modifications to electric chairs, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2913.9s)]
*  possessed no relevant formal training or education [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2916.6200000000003s)]
*  and claims that he was told that [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2919.38s)]
*  those who did possess such qualifications [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2920.94s)]
*  would not provide advice due to their opinions [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2923.42s)]
*  on death penalty, fear of reprisals, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2925.98s)]
*  or that they were squeamish about the subject. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2928.6200000000003s)]
*  So he was... [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2934.3s)]
*  What was he? [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2935.1400000000003s)]
*  What was his background? [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2935.98s)]
*  Just could you let it here? [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2940.34s)]
*  So his career continued with other state prisons [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2941.6200000000003s)]
*  seeking his advice on execution facilities [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2944.5s)]
*  other than electrocution, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2947.26s)]
*  such as gas chambers, hanging and lethal injection. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2948.3s)]
*  How do you say his name? [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2951.94s)]
*  Luchter? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2952.78s)]
*  Luchter initially professed his ignorance [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2954.1800000000003s)]
*  of other methods of executions. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2957.38s)]
*  The authorities seeking his advice reminded him [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2959.54s)]
*  that others with more qualifications refused to help. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2962.54s)]
*  Luchter claims to have taught himself [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2965.7400000000002s)]
*  on these other methods of execution [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2968.4599999999996s)]
*  and provided advice that was used by the authorities [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2970.58s)]
*  to improve safety and efficiency. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2972.98s)]
*  So it's fall claim when Luchter claimed [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2975.5s)]
*  to have been sought as a witness for the defense [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2978.3799999999997s)]
*  for Ernest Sundell during... [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2981.14s)]
*  So one of the Nazis, right? [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2983.66s)]
*  In Canada for spreading false news [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2986.18s)]
*  by publishing and sending material [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2988.14s)]
*  denying Holocaust overseas. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2989.4199999999996s)]
*  Luchter was asked by the defense [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2992.3399999999997s)]
*  to travel to Poland to vision out [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2994.3799999999997s)]
*  so that no, maybe that guy wasn't a Nazi, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2996.18s)]
*  maybe he was like a Holocaust denier. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=2998.7400000000002s)]
*  Ernst Sundell. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3000.66s)]
*  So what is the trial? [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3002.58s)]
*  Spreading false news. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3003.62s)]
*  So he's just been accused of spreading false news [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3005.02s)]
*  by publishing and sending material denying the Holocaust. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3007.62s)]
*  So he's being tried for that. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3010.58s)]
*  And Luchter was asked by the defense [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3012.18s)]
*  to travel to Poland to visit Auschwitz [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3014.1s)]
*  to investigate whether there had been operating [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3016.5s)]
*  gas chambers for executions at the camp. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3018.5s)]
*  So at first examination, Luchter felt that [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3020.58s)]
*  using poison gas in a building with the internal [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3025.3s)]
*  and external design of the buildings [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3028.6600000000003s)]
*  currently on display at the site [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3029.5s)]
*  would have caused the death of everyone [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3030.46s)]
*  in the area outside the buildings as well as inside. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3032.5800000000004s)]
*  The film shows videotaped footage taken in Poland [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3035.78s)]
*  of Luchter taking samples of bricks in the buildings [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3038.5800000000004s)]
*  to take back to the United States forensic science labs [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3041.7000000000003s)]
*  to determine whether there was evidence [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3044.6200000000003s)]
*  of poison gas in the material. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3046.1800000000003s)]
*  These samples were not identified [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3047.7400000000002s)]
*  as to where they came from. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3049.34s)]
*  Luchter states that the laboratories [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3050.7400000000002s)]
*  reported that there was not any trace [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3052.3s)]
*  of any poison gas at any time. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3054.2200000000003s)]
*  Right, I remember this. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3057.34s)]
*  Yeah, after his conclusions were disproven [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3058.42s)]
*  and negativity publicity ensued, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3060.6200000000003s)]
*  Luchter lost his work as a consultant to American prisons. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3063.38s)]
*  So his conclusions were disproven [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3067.02s)]
*  so they must have found gas. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3069.02s)]
*  Look, there's a lot of evidence [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3070.7000000000003s)]
*  that those were gas chambers. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3073.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. That's a crazy thing. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3075.34s)]
*  I think I remember that this documentary, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3077.6600000000003s)]
*  because he starts saying these things, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3080.3s)]
*  it's very similar to like social media clout. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3082.2200000000003s)]
*  He starts saying these things [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3085.0600000000004s)]
*  and everybody starts to, in the Holocaust denial community, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3086.18s)]
*  starts like bigging them up and going like, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3089.06s)]
*  this is our guy, and he gets more ideological [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3090.8599999999997s)]
*  as a result of it. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3093.7s)]
*  Yeah, and this is the, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3094.62s)]
*  see, he didn't know what the fuck he was talking about. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3095.7s)]
*  This is one of the answers. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3097.3799999999997s)]
*  It says, it's all a question of concentration. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3099.3399999999997s)]
*  Once the gas is released into the atmosphere, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3101.5s)]
*  its concentration decreases and is no longer dangerous. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3104.2999999999997s)]
*  Also, HCN dissipates quickly. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3107.4199999999996s)]
*  The execution gas chambers in US prisons [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3110.06s)]
*  were also ventilated directly into the atmosphere. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3112.66s)]
*  So it just dissipates. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3116.2599999999998s)]
*  Furthermore, the argument would hold [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3117.8599999999997s)]
*  for the extermination chambers, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3120.42s)]
*  it would hold for the delousing chambers as well, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3122.54s)]
*  and one would have to conclude [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3126.74s)]
*  that no delousing chambers existed either. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3127.98s)]
*  So it's just he doesn't understand how it dissipates. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3131.74s)]
*  So there's probably no trace because there's no trace left. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3134.66s)]
*  We're talking about, he's doing this 70 years later. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3139.7799999999997s)]
*  I think that's what the documentary was about, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3143.42s)]
*  was that this guy quickly got in over his head. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3146.8199999999997s)]
*  The minute he said one thing, they were all like, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3149.06s)]
*  we love you, and he became this figurehead of that movement. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3150.62s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3154.74s)]
*  People saying that they know stuff, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3156.2599999999998s)]
*  which is sort of the disease of our time. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3157.98s)]
*  So that's the other Dr. Death. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3159.9s)]
*  They can have a duel of douchebags. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3161.02s)]
*  I think the guy with the surgeon's gonna win. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3162.62s)]
*  He seems more evil. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3165.14s)]
*  The other guy seems to still like ego got ahold of him [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3166.46s)]
*  or just stupidity. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3168.54s)]
*  The Errol Morris guy. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3169.58s)]
*  Yeah, it is a wild thing out there [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3170.7s)]
*  to think of going under the knife [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3173.4199999999996s)]
*  and then waking up and realizing that the... [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3175.2599999999998s)]
*  You heard about this? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3177.7799999999997s)]
*  There was a lab, I believe, I can't remember which hospital, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3179.1s)]
*  where the women were going in for fertility treatment. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3183.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3186.02s)]
*  And they were not being given Oxycontin, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3186.8599999999997s)]
*  they were being given saline. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3189.22s)]
*  And they would be under general. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3190.8999999999996s)]
*  They'd be under general anesthesia so they couldn't stop it. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3193.14s)]
*  So they were doing basically surgery, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3195.8599999999997s)]
*  but you were paralyzed [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3197.66s)]
*  because you're under general anesthetic. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3199.3399999999997s)]
*  So you feel the pain the entire time. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3201.54s)]
*  And they found out why. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3203.22s)]
*  It's because there was a drug addict [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3205.14s)]
*  who was in charge of dispensing the Oxycontin [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3207.2999999999997s)]
*  who was just taking it and being like, best mine. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3210.62s)]
*  Or it was fentanyl. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3212.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3214.2599999999998s)]
*  And she was just dripping the fentanyl into her bag [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3215.18s)]
*  and taking it home. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3217.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3218.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3219.22s)]
*  Wow. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3220.54s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3223.1s)]
*  Jeez. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3225.58s)]
*  That's a rough one. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3226.7799999999997s)]
*  And then they would come up and they would say, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3228.62s)]
*  fucking evil people in this world. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3229.94s)]
*  They would say, oh, I felt so much pain. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3231.58s)]
*  And they would go, no, no, you're fine. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3233.42s)]
*  It's like, no, no, I think I just went under general surgery [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3234.98s)]
*  with absolutely no painkiller at all, but I was paralyzed. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3238.02s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3241.2200000000003s)]
*  Imagine that. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3243.3s)]
*  Imagine that. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3244.58s)]
*  Well, imagine when they used to do it [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3245.42s)]
*  when you weren't paralyzed. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3246.42s)]
*  Oh, they put a piece of leather in your mouth [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3248.1s)]
*  and just take your limb off. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3249.58s)]
*  Just saw your leg. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3250.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3251.34s)]
*  Dancers with wolves style. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3252.62s)]
*  They would give you, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3254.7400000000002s)]
*  ethyl alcohol, right? [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3255.98s)]
*  They would give you booze. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3258.54s)]
*  They'd give you whatever the fuck they could give you. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3260.46s)]
*  It's not gonna help. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3261.7s)]
*  What do you think the garlic and the vampire connection is? [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3262.66s)]
*  Garlic and vampires? [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3265.42s)]
*  Yeah, where'd that one come from? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3266.38s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not sure. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3267.94s)]
*  Isn't garlic a very potent antibacterial? [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3269.22s)]
*  Don't they say to take garlic if you have stomach flus? [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3273.14s)]
*  I think that's one of those homeopathic solutions. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3276.9s)]
*  That people say, take garlic if you're sick. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3281.38s)]
*  But why vampires? [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3283.74s)]
*  Maybe vampires are connected to the idea [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3285.14s)]
*  of what a vampire is, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3288.54s)]
*  is not knowing what happens to people when they get sick. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3289.9s)]
*  Not knowing what happens to people when they get a plague. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3293.86s)]
*  Blaming it on someone else. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3296.62s)]
*  Blaming it on someone evil. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3297.7799999999997s)]
*  Blaming it on a curse. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3299.46s)]
*  Blaming it on someone who came back from the dead. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3301.5s)]
*  Why does someone have anemia? [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3303.5s)]
*  Why is someone losing all their blood? [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3306.9s)]
*  You could blame that on a vampire. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3309.06s)]
*  Yeah, I guess if you were extremely ill, [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3311.02s)]
*  it would seem like, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3313.74s)]
*  but you're still walking through the world, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3314.86s)]
*  it would seem like you had been possessed on some level. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3316.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, I've said that about people that get addicted to drugs. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3318.74s)]
*  I've met people and they weren't addicted to drugs [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3322.58s)]
*  and they got addicted to drugs. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3324.62s)]
*  It's like, oh my God, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3325.7s)]
*  it's like that person got bit by a vampire. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3326.54s)]
*  Totally, yeah. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3328.4199999999996s)]
*  I think about that a lot, not the vampire thing, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3329.5s)]
*  but about people who, and I was on that road, by the way. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3331.58s)]
*  That was going to be my life. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3334.9399999999996s)]
*  But people who decided to get high [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3336.4199999999996s)]
*  instead of do anything else. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3337.8999999999996s)]
*  It's like, my life will just be getting high [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3339.2599999999998s)]
*  and that'll be it. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3341.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and well, there's certain ones, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3342.18s)]
*  the ones that get physically addictive. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3343.58s)]
*  They're terrifying. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3345.34s)]
*  The oxys, the cocaine, like that kind of shit, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3346.7000000000003s)]
*  where you're physically drawn to it. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3350.1400000000003s)]
*  You need it to get well. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3352.5s)]
*  The heroin people that need it, they're sick, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3354.46s)]
*  and they need it to get well. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3357.06s)]
*  That is wild stuff. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3358.46s)]
*  Meth does this even scarier thing, [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3359.7400000000002s)]
*  which is that it lowers your brain's ability [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3361.7400000000002s)]
*  to create its own, what's the word for it? [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3365.26s)]
*  Serotonin. Serotonin. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3367.78s)]
*  And so meth becomes this sort of cyclical trap [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3369.06s)]
*  where you can't actually, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3372.46s)]
*  it's not just that you want to get high. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3373.7400000000002s)]
*  Your brain can't make you happy without it. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3376.1800000000003s)]
*  And it takes like a long time to rewire your brain [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3377.42s)]
*  in that particular way. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3380.1000000000004s)]
*  Wow. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3383.26s)]
*  Heroin's the one that everybody overdoses from. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3384.1000000000004s)]
*  And meth is the one that people kind of go mad from slowly [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3386.6200000000003s)]
*  because their brains get weirdly atrophied in that way. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3389.5s)]
*  One of my friends from the pool hall was a crack addict. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3391.9s)]
*  And he would go get crack, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3395.3s)]
*  and then he would have to come down by drinking 40 ounces. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3397.26s)]
*  So he would get so fucked up. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3401.1800000000003s)]
*  I would, he was always trying to, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3402.66s)]
*  I took him a couple of times to like bad neighborhoods [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3404.5s)]
*  so he could cop. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3407.2599999999998s)]
*  But then we'd always have to go to a liquor store [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3408.8599999999997s)]
*  and he would get like a 40 ounce. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3411.62s)]
*  Of what? [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3413.2599999999998s)]

*  never have any ambition and don't leave. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3423.58s)]
*  Which is probably what they do. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3425.8999999999996s)]
*  It was exactly what I would do if I was evil. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3428.3799999999997s)]
*  The way I would choose what alcohol I would drink [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3431.86s)]
*  is like if a gangster rapper rapped about it, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3433.98s)]
*  I would drink it. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3436.1s)]
*  So gin and juice. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3436.94s)]

*  St. Ides for the real brothers in the room. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3445.1s)]
*  And Carlo Rossi because E40 had a song [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3447.7000000000003s)]
*  called Top of the Line Wine, Carlos Rossi. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3451.54s)]
*  And then Mad Dog 2020 and Cisco. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3453.9s)]
*  Those were the things that I drank. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3457.14s)]

*  Hasidic Jew. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3545.48s)]
*  Like when my parents split, [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3546.32s)]
*  my dad got like super, super religious. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3548.0s)]
*  We come from crazy, I mean like a hardcore version of, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3550.04s)]
*  it's not like what you, it's like, [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3553.68s)]

*  No. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3556.84s)]
*  It's a show on Netflix. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3557.68s)]
*  It's about a really hardcore sect. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3559.08s)]
*  That's the sect that my family. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3561.0s)]
*  Is it a documentary series? [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3561.84s)]
*  No, it's a show. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3563.16s)]
*  Oh, it's a show. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3564.2s)]
*  It's a scripted show about the sect of Hasidic Judaism [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3565.04s)]
*  called the Sotmars. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3567.6s)]
*  And that's the world that my family was from. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3568.44s)]
*  My stepmother was Sotmar [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3570.52s)]
*  and my family came from a town called New Square, New York. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3571.64s)]
*  Do you know anything about that? [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3574.92s)]
*  No. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3575.76s)]
*  New Square is really interesting. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3576.6s)]
*  It's like a village up above Muncie, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3577.42s)]
*  which is already an unbelievably ultra-orthodox place. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3579.32s)]
*  But Muncie is nothing compared to Sqvair. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3582.44s)]
*  Sqvair is like the height, [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3585.12s)]
*  women don't drive in New Square, New York. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3587.12s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3589.12s)]
*  This is New York City. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3589.96s)]
*  I got cousins that have Eastern European accents [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3590.8s)]
*  and they are third generation American. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3594.92s)]
*  Which borough is this? [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3596.56s)]
*  Well, my family lived, [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3597.8s)]
*  Muncie is in upstate New York [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3599.48s)]
*  and my family lived in Brooklyn in Seagate. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3601.0s)]
*  Do you know where Seagate is? [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3603.6800000000003s)]
*  It's like Pasconi Island at the tip of Brooklyn. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3605.08s)]
*  And that was a Sotmar neighborhood. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3607.24s)]
*  And kids in that neighborhood, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3608.42s)]
*  we used to play dodge ball games [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3609.2599999999998s)]
*  where it would be the ultra-orthodox kids [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3610.8s)]
*  versus the actually religious kids. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3612.92s)]
*  That's how intense things were. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3615.04s)]
*  An ultra-orthodox person that you looked at and went, [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3616.84s)]
*  wow, that's a real Jew right there. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3618.8s)]
*  We were basically the Gentiles of the community. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3620.96s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3622.96s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3624.0s)]
*  And I would be nine months a year in Oakland, [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3624.84s)]
*  regular public school, listening to Too Short, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3626.5s)]
*  fly back to my dad's house, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3628.84s)]
*  get driven to the orthodox barber shop. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3630.54s)]
*  They'd put a yarmulke on me, slacks, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3633.44s)]
*  and I would go cosplay as an extra from Fiddler [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3635.0s)]
*  on the Roof for six weeks a year. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3636.84s)]
*  Wow. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3638.2000000000003s)]
*  So that was the pre, before rehab. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3640.32s)]
*  And that's sort of, [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3642.4s)]
*  I think that's the reason that I fell into the rehab [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3643.7200000000003s)]
*  so heavily, into the drug so heavily [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3645.52s)]
*  is because everything about me made me feel like I am, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3647.4s)]
*  I don't fit. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3651.28s)]
*  I don't fit. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3652.4s)]
*  I'm a hearing person in a deaf world. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3653.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm essentially a Gentile in a Jewish world. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3655.0s)]
*  That is so crazy that you were considered a Gentile. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3658.28s)]
*  I mean, they didn't really consider me, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3661.16s)]
*  but effectively. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3662.72s)]
*  You were not as religious as them. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3663.56s)]
*  Effectively, might as well have been. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3664.4s)]
*  There was something wrong with you. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3665.22s)]
*  Dude, there was a local rabbi [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3666.06s)]
*  when I was getting close to my bar mitzvah, [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3668.7999999999997s)]
*  and he goes, he noticed, he was very nice, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3670.54s)]
*  and he noticed that I didn't know Hebrew. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3673.44s)]
*  These kids spoke, and I'm not kidding, [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3675.68s)]
*  these kids spoke Yiddish as a first language. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3677.04s)]
*  That's why they had the Eastern European accent, right? [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3678.92s)]
*  So my uncle, he was first generation American, [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3681.04s)]
*  so he sounds like an American [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3683.64s)]
*  because the first generation Americans say, go fit in. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3684.7999999999997s)]
*  But then by the time he had kids, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3687.74s)]
*  they're like feeling their comfort in the United States, [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3689.04s)]
*  and they go, don't go fit in. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3691.86s)]
*  Go to a seminary where we learn Yiddish. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3693.7400000000002s)]
*  So my cousins sound like extras from Dr. Zhivago, [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3695.6200000000003s)]
*  and my uncle sounds like a New Yorker. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3699.02s)]
*  It's that weird. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3700.82s)]
*  So they speak Yiddish as a first language. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3701.94s)]
*  I would bring an English prayer book to school, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3703.58s)]
*  and kids would, people would be staring [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3705.6600000000003s)]
*  like it was a scarlet letter, [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3707.86s)]
*  like there's something wrong with me [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3708.9s)]
*  because I had an English book. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3709.9s)]
*  Because you couldn't speak it in Hebrew. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3711.06s)]
*  Because I didn't know Hebrew. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3712.34s)]
*  So it's getting towards my bar mitzvah. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3714.1s)]
*  It's my 12th year or 11th year, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3716.78s)]
*  and I don't know the alphabet. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3719.1600000000003s)]
*  And this rabbi sees that I'm struggling. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3720.7s)]
*  And my dad was deaf, [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3723.02s)]
*  and so he had this kind of like bizarre relationship [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3724.5s)]
*  with the community where he was like one part accepted, [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3726.8599999999997s)]
*  one part almost mascot in a way that was a little insulting, [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3729.74s)]
*  but he was loved, whatever. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3733.2799999999997s)]
*  The rabbi said, give him to me, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3735.16s)]
*  and I'll teach him Hebrew, right? [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3737.14s)]
*  This is like the 90s, late 80s, early 90s. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3738.74s)]
*  You could at that time ask for some alone time with a child [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3741.8199999999997s)]
*  and they'd be handed over, no questions asked, right? [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3744.06s)]
*  So I go to his house and he starts teaching me the Hebrew, [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3746.2999999999997s)]
*  the alphabet, basic, elemental. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3749.94s)]
*  I mean, this is like a Talmudic scholar [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3751.62s)]
*  teaching me the ABCs, right? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3753.58s)]
*  And I am struggling. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3755.58s)]
*  I can't get it. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3757.7000000000003s)]
*  And he goes, don't worry, don't worry. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3758.8s)]
*  He goes, don't be embarrassed. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3760.46s)]
*  Hold on, Shmuley, Shmuley, come in, come, come. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3762.98s)]
*  And his son comes into the room and he goes, [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3765.7000000000003s)]
*  do the English alphabet. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3768.06s)]
*  This is an American kid. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3769.38s)]
*  He goes, do the English alphabet. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3770.5s)]
*  And the kid goes, oh no, A, B, G, [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3772.7000000000003s)]
*  and then he slaps me, the rabbi slaps me on the back. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3777.8999999999996s)]
*  He goes, see, he's stupid in English, [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3781.1s)]
*  you are stupid in Hebrew, everybody's stupid. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3782.66s)]
*  That was the energy. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3785.02s)]
*  What a sweetheart, right? [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3787.2599999999998s)]
*  That's a good way to approach it. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3788.58s)]
*  Yeah, he was willing to humiliate his eldest son [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3789.7799999999997s)]
*  to teach me to love learning. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3792.2999999999997s)]
*  That is funny though, [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3793.4199999999996s)]
*  the kid doesn't know the English alphabet. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3794.2599999999998s)]
*  I'm sure eventually he got it, but this was like, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3796.4199999999996s)]
*  maybe not. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3799.02s)]
*  Maybe not, I mean, there's communities in this country [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3799.8599999999997s)]
*  that exist generation after generation [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3801.72s)]
*  where they only speak one language. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3803.8599999999997s)]
*  No, it's like they made Wakanda in Brooklyn. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3804.98s)]
*  That was like the vibe, you know? [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3807.18s)]
*  And I was in multiple Wakandas too. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3808.54s)]
*  I was born into like the deaf Wakanda, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3810.7599999999998s)]
*  where imagine that, you're being born the enemy, [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3812.46s)]
*  but I'm a member of the deaf community, [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3815.3799999999997s)]
*  and I think every deaf person would say that, [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3817.54s)]
*  that I belong, but I also was the enemy. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3819.48s)]
*  I was the hearing. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3822.3799999999997s)]
*  And so you're- [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3823.2599999999998s)]
*  Why do they think of the hearing as the enemy? [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3824.54s)]
*  Well, that is a complicated question, [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3826.66s)]
*  and it's because there has been a lot of enforced oppression [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3828.62s)]
*  on the deaf community from the outside. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3834.02s)]
*  The story of sign language is really fascinating. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3836.72s)]
*  300 years ago, there was no sign language. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3841.3999999999996s)]
*  There was only the kind of sign, [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3843.8799999999997s)]
*  if you were born, 90% of deaf people are born [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3847.3799999999997s)]
*  into a hearing family, right? [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3849.48s)]
*  That's just the way genetics works. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3851.3599999999997s)]
*  Like most of the time, you don't have deaf family members. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3852.72s)]
*  And if you were born 350 years ago [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3854.7999999999997s)]
*  into one of those families, you just didn't have language. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3857.18s)]
*  You weren't given the gift of language, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3859.56s)]
*  which is the thing, I mean, think about how much language [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3861.48s)]
*  plays into your own life, Joe. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3864.0s)]
*  Speaking and everything you know, [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3866.0600000000004s)]
*  every thought process you have is mashed [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3868.6200000000003s)]
*  through the filter of language. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3870.94s)]
*  And in that situation, you'd be born into a family [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3872.54s)]
*  and you had zero language. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3874.98s)]
*  You would have a gesturing system that you'd created [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3876.5800000000004s)]
*  with your dad to be able to say, like, pass the potatoes. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3879.02s)]
*  And that was it. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3881.86s)]
*  You couldn't say how you feel, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3882.7000000000003s)]
*  you couldn't say what you wanted to do. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3883.86s)]
*  You couldn't even think about how you, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3885.1400000000003s)]
*  I mean, you could think, I don't know. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3886.3s)]
*  I mean, I've never experienced that. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3887.78s)]
*  But language is the thing that unlocks reason. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3889.82s)]
*  It's the thing that unlocks culture. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3892.7000000000003s)]
*  And people were stymied from that. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3894.62s)]
*  But if you were born lucky enough [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3896.2200000000003s)]
*  to have genetic deafness in your family, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3899.54s)]
*  so that you and your sibling were both deaf, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3901.66s)]
*  then the two of you sitting together [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3905.9s)]
*  could create language, a language of two, right? [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3907.86s)]
*  You would back and forth between two siblings [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3911.82s)]
*  create a family sign system that would enable [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3913.9s)]
*  the both of you learning from one another [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3917.7s)]
*  to create a language and enable you to reason and think [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3919.3s)]
*  and talk about how you feel, [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3922.36s)]
*  even if it was just with one person. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3923.46s)]
*  Communicate with the outside world. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3924.86s)]
*  But at least you could communicate with yourself [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3926.5s)]
*  and with one other person. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3928.38s)]
*  I mean, the difference between an isolated deaf person [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3929.5s)]
*  and a pair of siblings is the world. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3932.46s)]
*  It's freedom, it's everything. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3935.38s)]
*  So one day, a French priest walks along [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3937.7s)]
*  and sees two deaf sisters signing back and forth [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3941.54s)]
*  to one another, and he goes, that's language. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3943.9s)]
*  Prior to that, deaf people weren't even considered [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3946.5s)]
*  to be linguistic, they weren't even considered [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3948.58s)]
*  to be capable of reason, but he goes, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3950.26s)]
*  no, I know what that is, I'm looking at language. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3952.8199999999997s)]
*  So he goes to these sisters, his name is Abed Epe, [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3955.1s)]
*  and he says, teach me to sign. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3958.3799999999997s)]
*  Somehow he tells them, teach me these gestures to them, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3960.3399999999997s)]
*  teach me to sign. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3963.02s)]
*  They teach him to sign, and his thing was [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3964.2599999999998s)]
*  he wanted them to take the catechism, right? [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3967.14s)]
*  That he wanted them to be able to go to heaven. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3969.4599999999996s)]
*  He realized, oh, deaf people are linguistically capable, [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3971.3399999999997s)]
*  but they can't get into heaven unless they can take [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3974.62s)]
*  the catechism and confess their faith and take communion, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3976.74s)]
*  right, which makes sense if there is a God [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3979.06s)]
*  that God wouldn't allow them into heaven [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3981.94s)]
*  based on the fact that they couldn't speak. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3983.46s)]
*  He's like, my hands are tied here, bud. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3986.02s)]
*  So they teach him, they teach him, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3988.26s)]
*  and he teaches them back French, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3991.06s)]
*  and then he starts to gather the deaf people [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3993.38s)]
*  from around the world, I'm sorry, from around France, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3995.2200000000003s)]
*  and he creates the first school for the deaf. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3998.14s)]
*  He teaches them French in sign. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=3999.98s)]
*  In sign, that's right. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4002.18s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4003.78s)]
*  Because sign language and spoken language [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4004.62s)]
*  are not the same, a lot of people think that, right, [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4007.3s)]
*  that I speak American sign language, [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4009.06s)]
*  but people think, oh, it's a translation of English. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4010.98s)]
*  It's not, it's his complete own language, right? [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4013.14s)]
*  So. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4016.26s)]
*  Oh, I did not know that. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4017.1s)]
*  So much so that the way that he would fundraise [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4019.1s)]
*  for this school is he would do like a traveling road show [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4021.38s)]
*  where he would take his star pupils around France [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4024.9s)]
*  and around Europe, and they would be at an exhibition hall, [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4028.28s)]
*  and a person in the audience would ask a question. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4031.14s)]
*  He would say, oh, Joe, do you have a question [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4033.42s)]
*  for the deaf person? [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4034.82s)]
*  And then you'd ask them some French question, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4035.66s)]
*  like what degree of suffering can be borne by man [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4037.62s)]
*  or how many creams is too many creams for a brie or whatever? [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4041.2999999999997s)]
*  And he would take your question, sign it to his star pupils, [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4043.1s)]
*  and they would take a piece of chalk, [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4046.54s)]
*  walk up to the blackboard, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4047.94s)]
*  and write the answer in perfect French. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4048.8599999999997s)]
*  And people lost their fucking minds. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4051.2999999999997s)]
*  Like they couldn't believe it. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4053.3399999999997s)]
*  Like deaf people, oh my God, [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4054.66s)]
*  it like unlocked this whole conception of the deaf [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4055.7799999999997s)]
*  as like they can think, they can reason. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4058.42s)]
*  Oh, all they need is language to be free, right? [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4060.94s)]
*  So this whole network of deaf schools [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4064.66s)]
*  for the deaf started to spring up. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4067.02s)]
*  They sprung up in all over Europe, [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4068.2999999999997s)]
*  and they would copy the teaching methods [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4070.8199999999997s)]
*  of the school for the deaf. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4073.1s)]
*  And a guy from America came over, right? [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4076.7799999999997s)]
*  And he saw this system, [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4079.9399999999996s)]
*  and he basically took their star pupil. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4082.58s)]
*  And one of the things was the deaf would teach each other. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4085.1s)]
*  So you would teach them sign, [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4087.7s)]
*  and then they would become educated, [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4088.8599999999997s)]
*  and then they would become a professor at this school. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4089.98s)]
*  And he took like the star professor, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4091.8599999999997s)]
*  Laurent Clark was his name. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4093.7s)]
*  Thomas Gallaudet was the name of the American. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4095.8199999999997s)]
*  He came over, and he saw Laurent Clark, [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4097.74s)]
*  and he said, move to America with me, [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4100.78s)]
*  and let's go replicate this in America. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4101.7s)]
*  So Thomas Gallaudet says, yes, they get on a boat, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4104.58s)]
*  they sail to America. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4107.139999999999s)]
*  By the time they landed, [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4108.54s)]
*  Thomas Gallaudet knew rudimentary sign, [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4109.66s)]
*  and Laurent Clark, who was like a fucking genius, [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4111.62s)]
*  knew, basically had been taught English. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4113.74s)]
*  And they set up the first school for the deaf in America. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4115.98s)]
*  Right? [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4118.339999999999s)]
*  He figured out English on a boat? [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4119.179999999999s)]
*  He was a genius, like a real genius. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4120.0s)]
*  Like an actual, like lucky enough to have been, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4121.54s)]
*  you know, these circumstances in history [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4124.7s)]
*  where like the perfect man at the perfect time, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4126.459999999999s)]
*  like they come here, they set up this school here, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4128.46s)]
*  and they start to create American sign language. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4131.26s)]
*  And they borrowed from these different worlds, right? [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4133.82s)]
*  They took French sign language as the base. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4136.38s)]
*  Martha's Vineyard, back then, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4138.54s)]
*  had this weird genetic anomaly [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4140.74s)]
*  on the island of Martha's Vineyard. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4142.34s)]
*  This is like before, [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4143.58s)]
*  it was just a place for Kennedys to fuck their mistresses. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4144.5s)]
*  This was like back when it was a fishing island. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4146.54s)]
*  There was some weird genetic thing that had happened [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4150.1s)]
*  where over the course of hundreds of years, [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4152.06s)]
*  one in 25 people on Martha's Vineyard was deaf. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4154.26s)]
*  And it was this very bizarre kind of like, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4157.66s)]
*  like almost the equality that deaf people [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4160.66s)]
*  on Martha's Vineyard felt was almost like the opposite [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4163.42s)]
*  of like what affirmative action is attempting to do, right? [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4166.18s)]
*  Affirmative action wants to correct a historic harm [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4169.22s)]
*  by changing the playing field. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4172.74s)]
*  This was an equity of everybody was the same [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4175.18s)]
*  because everybody on Martha's Vineyard knew [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4178.54s)]
*  either was deaf, knew a deaf person, [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4181.22s)]
*  or was related to a deaf person. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4183.139999999999s)]
*  So everybody, hearing and non-hearing, [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4184.5s)]
*  signed on Martha's Vineyard. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4186.86s)]
*  It was a sign system called Martha's Vineyard Sign Language. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4188.62s)]
*  They took some of that. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4191.78s)]
*  They took the Plains Indian Sign Language, [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4192.82s)]
*  P-I-S-L it's called. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4194.7s)]
*  You know that like gesture? [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4195.98s)]
*  You've seen it in like movies [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4198.34s)]
*  where the Native Americans will gesture to each other. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4199.82s)]
*  And you think they present it as if it's like a war language [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4203.0599999999995s)]
*  so they don't have to make noise. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4206.099999999999s)]
*  But what it actually was, [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4207.42s)]
*  was all the tribes in America spoke different languages. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4208.259999999999s)]
*  So they created this kind of Esperanto of the tribes [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4211.46s)]
*  so that they could trade. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4215.0199999999995s)]
*  They could do trade. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4216.02s)]
*  And that was called Plains Indian Sign Language. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4216.860000000001s)]
*  And they took all that into like kind of a bouillabaisse [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4219.06s)]
*  of French Sign Language base, Martha's Vineyard Chaser, [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4221.860000000001s)]
*  and Plains Indian sprinkled on top. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4224.700000000001s)]
*  And they created American Sign Language. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4226.38s)]
*  And then a hundred years, 200 years later, [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4228.22s)]
*  my mother was born deaf in Oakland, California. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4230.860000000001s)]
*  And she went to the California School for the Deaf. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4234.580000000001s)]
*  And she absorbed this language. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4236.780000000001s)]
*  My mother was 13 when she went [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4239.22s)]
*  to the California School for the Deaf. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4240.46s)]
*  She was in an oral school system. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4241.700000000001s)]
*  This is my long-winded way of telling you [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4244.98s)]
*  why deaf people have such a problem with hearing people. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4246.46s)]
*  That language that she learned, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4250.179999999999s)]
*  she was in an oral school system. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4251.9s)]
*  So almost as soon as the sign language system came out, [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4253.98s)]
*  hearing people looked at it and go, [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4258.5s)]

*  The one thing that unlocked their freedom, [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4261.219999999999s)]
*  the one thing that unlocked their minds, [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4263.599999999999s)]
*  hearing people saw it and said, [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4265.54s)]
*  we have to take that away from them. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4266.82s)]
*  We have to make them more like us. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4268.139999999999s)]
*  By doing the sign, they're creating more Wakanda. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4269.66s)]
*  They're creating an insular sort of closed circuit system [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4273.46s)]
*  of culture, right? [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4277.54s)]
*  And weirdly, this was at a time in American history [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4278.7s)]
*  where those closed circuits of culture [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4282.36s)]
*  were really frowned upon. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4284.78s)]
*  This was like- [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4286.06s)]
*  Oh, they were frowning upon deaf people [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4286.9s)]
*  signing to each other. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4288.82s)]
*  Deaf people signing to each other, [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4289.9800000000005s)]
*  Italians having their own newspapers, [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4291.02s)]
*  Chinese immigrants, like every, [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4292.9800000000005s)]
*  at that time in American history, [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4294.7s)]
*  the idea of creating like an immigrant subculture [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4296.1s)]
*  was really frowned upon. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4299.54s)]
*  Alexander Graham Bell, whose parents were deaf like me, [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4302.38s)]
*  had a deaf wife, he became the champion [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4304.900000000001s)]
*  of what was called the oral system. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4307.0s)]
*  And the oral system was, [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4309.42s)]
*  let's not allow them to sign, [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4311.22s)]
*  let's teach them to speak, let's make them like us. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4313.66s)]
*  Let's make them talk normally and function normally, [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4316.66s)]
*  let's make them like us. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4319.46s)]
*  But it was a crazy failure, [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4321.820000000001s)]
*  and it makes sense why, right? [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4324.900000000001s)]
*  They can't hear the sounds. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4326.740000000001s)]
*  They can't hear the sounds. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4327.58s)]
*  Oliver Sack said teaching a deaf person without sign [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4328.46s)]
*  is like teaching you Japanese [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4332.22s)]
*  from inside of a soundproof booth [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4333.82s)]
*  by holding up flashcards in Japanese [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4335.22s)]
*  and like putting a symbol next to it. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4337.86s)]
*  It was like kind of doomed to failure. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4339.34s)]
*  And then they went through this 200 year reimposed darkness. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4341.66s)]
*  There was a trial where all the hearing educators [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4346.74s)]
*  decided the deaf people wouldn't sign anymore. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4349.9400000000005s)]
*  They fired all the deaf educators, [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4352.26s)]
*  and they pushed them out, [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4354.02s)]
*  and they created this oral system, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4355.18s)]
*  which really, I mean, it worked for some people. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4356.58s)]
*  But what it created was you had to be exceptional [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4359.54s)]
*  in order to be average in the deaf world. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4362.86s)]
*  You had to be a genius [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4365.38s)]
*  in order to get that oral system to work for you [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4366.9s)]
*  because your natural mode of communication [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4369.18s)]
*  had been kind of stamped out. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4370.74s)]
*  And then in about the 70s, [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4372.1s)]
*  deaf people started to like kind of rise up [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4375.18s)]
*  and say, fuck that, we're signing, this is who we are. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4377.14s)]
*  This is our native language. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4380.46s)]
*  And when I was born in 79, [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4382.3s)]
*  that was the world I was born into. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4385.38s)]
*  And so from that, two sisters on a fucking corner [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4386.9s)]
*  in a slum in Paris to that school, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4391.02s)]
*  to Gallaudet, to a boat ride, to the Martha's Vineyard, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4393.38s)]
*  to the California School for the Deaf, [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4396.74s)]
*  to my mother's hands, to my hands, [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4398.38s)]
*  that was the way that I acquired language, [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4400.26s)]
*  was through this crazy historical journey. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4402.46s)]
*  And that to me is the reason [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4404.9s)]
*  that when I was born into the deaf community, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4408.54s)]
*  there was so much distrust of the hearing world [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4410.34s)]
*  because they were like, they stole from us [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4413.02s)]
*  the one thing that gave us freedom. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4415.06s)]
*  That makes sense. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4416.860000000001s)]
*  Wow, I did not know any of that stuff. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4417.700000000001s)]
*  That's incredible. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4419.22s)]
*  Well, how does someone get to be [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4420.9400000000005s)]
*  a fake sign language interpreter [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4424.620000000001s)]
*  and be on stage with Obama? [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4426.9400000000005s)]
*  Was it Obama? [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4429.540000000001s)]
*  Oh, it's been multiple people. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4430.5s)]
*  But there was one recently that happened. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4431.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4433.9800000000005s)]
*  But the Obama one was bananas [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4434.820000000001s)]
*  because this guy was totally insane [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4436.620000000001s)]
*  and he was standing in front of Obama [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4438.620000000001s)]
*  just making things up. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4439.9800000000005s)]
*  I'll tell you how good he is. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4441.42s)]
*  Can I see it? [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4443.14s)]
*  The Obama guy? [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4443.9800000000005s)]
*  How bad the Obama guy is. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4444.82s)]
*  Well, I think it's just gibberish. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4445.78s)]
*  I think it's just the sign language version of gibberish. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4447.18s)]
*  My life was going to appointments with my mother [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4451.42s)]
*  and being tasked with the job of interpreting [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4456.58s)]
*  for my mom's medical appointments. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4459.74s)]
*  It was like a non-consensual internship program. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4462.02s)]
*  Like her medical appointments. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4465.9800000000005s)]
*  And then I started to get in trouble. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4467.7s)]
*  And then the subject of the meeting [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4469.58s)]
*  would be me. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4472.14s)]
*  It would be like a disciplinary meeting about me. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4473.22s)]
*  So you would have to explain [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4475.06s)]
*  what your mom was having a problem with with you. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4476.3s)]
*  Or what the school system [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4478.34s)]
*  or what the Oakland Police Department, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4479.38s)]
*  what their problem with me was. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4480.820000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4482.34s)]
*  And then you have to do this kind of like, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4483.18s)]
*  this kind of interpretive dance [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4485.1s)]
*  where you're not, you can't be like, [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4486.9400000000005s)]
*  oh, we think your son is awesome. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4489.58s)]
*  He's a cool kid. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4490.820000000001s)]
*  We love him. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4491.660000000001s)]
*  Because then your mom, my mom's not stupid. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4492.4800000000005s)]
*  She'd be like, all right, let's see how bad this guy is. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4493.700000000001s)]
*  Look at this serious guy. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4495.1s)]
*  Okay, well that's not Obama. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4496.5s)]
*  No, that's not the one. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4499.26s)]
*  This is the guy. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4500.38s)]
*  I remember that. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4501.22s)]
*  It's the same guy. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4502.06s)]
*  It's the same guy. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4502.900000000001s)]
*  Oh, this was at the Nelson Mandela Memorial. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4503.72s)]
*  Yeah, so check this dude out. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4507.1s)]
*  This video doesn't have him with Obama. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4509.02s)]
*  Okay, just show him by himself with that other gentleman. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4510.900000000001s)]
*  So what is he doing here, Moshe? [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4514.400000000001s)]
*  I am at a disadvantage, Joe, [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4516.62s)]
*  because this is South Africa. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4518.740000000001s)]
*  And I do not speak South African sign language. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4521.7s)]
*  Oh. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4524.14s)]
*  But I remember this guy. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4524.9800000000005s)]
*  So there is a South African sign language. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4525.820000000001s)]
*  I would assume. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4528.26s)]
*  Every system, you wanna hear something crazy. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4529.1s)]
*  It is so not a translation of English [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4532.02s)]
*  that my mother would have a much harder time [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4533.42s)]
*  understanding a British signer than a French signer. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4537.26s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4541.740000000001s)]
*  So it has nothing. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4542.58s)]
*  It's divorced from English. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4543.42s)]
*  Wow. Right? [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4544.9800000000005s)]
*  Ah, this lady. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4545.820000000001s)]
*  Okay, so I can tell you that this woman [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4547.22s)]
*  is actually using sign language. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4549.58s)]
*  This is actual sign language. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4552.14s)]
*  But she is very bad at sign language. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4554.22s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4556.820000000001s)]
*  Yes, those are real letters. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4557.660000000001s)]
*  This is completely incomprehensible. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4559.9s)]
*  55 million is what she just said. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4562.62s)]
*  I don't know what that is. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4565.14s)]
*  Please. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4566.06s)]
*  Announcement tonight, handcuffs. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4568.26s)]
*  Look, she waved her arms around [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4570.7s)]
*  like she was singing Jingle Bells. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4572.02s)]
*  But that's not true, right? [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4573.58s)]
*  If she's doing some sign language. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4574.74s)]
*  Well, she's a hustler, whatever this is. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4576.7s)]
*  But I did, dude, I've been to so many appointments [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4578.78s)]
*  with my mother where I walk in, [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4581.62s)]
*  and it's an emergency room appointment. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4584.22s)]
*  And I go, you can leave. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4586.82s)]
*  Just leave. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4588.62s)]
*  Because you aren't qualified to do this, [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4589.66s)]
*  and this is fucking life or death for my mother, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4591.7s)]
*  and you're here, you shouldn't have taken this fucking job. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4594.38s)]
*  You should have known better than to take this job [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4597.38s)]
*  because this is an emergency room situation. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4599.3s)]
*  So that's, when I was an interpreter, [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4601.9s)]
*  the responsibility of that was massive to me. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4603.66s)]
*  I felt that so acutely because I'd lived through it [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4606.58s)]
*  in such a direct way. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4610.18s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4611.46s)]
*  I've been an interpreter [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4612.3s)]
*  when people were told they were dying. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4613.86s)]
*  I've been an interpreter when people were graduated [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4615.42s)]
*  from graduate school, from getting their doctorate. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4617.78s)]
*  I've been an interpreter where people were in court, [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4620.74s)]
*  and it was literally the degree to which I could sign [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4623.0199999999995s)]
*  accurately and faithfully was the difference [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4626.259999999999s)]
*  between them going to prison and not going to prison. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4628.0199999999995s)]
*  I've done all of that, [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4630.66s)]
*  and that weight is super massive to me. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4632.0599999999995s)]
*  And super important. I can only imagine. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4635.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4636.54s)]
*  And some funny shit has happened along the way too. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4637.5s)]
*  I'm sure. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4639.78s)]
*  Like some very strange situations. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4640.62s)]
*  How does the deaf community feel about people [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4643.219999999999s)]
*  who get like implants and can hear again? [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4645.26s)]
*  So that's another complicated question. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4648.26s)]
*  I think, have you ever seen The Sound and the Fury? [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4650.62s)]
*  No. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4652.46s)]
*  It's a fucking beautiful and fantastic documentary [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4653.3s)]
*  about cochlear implants and the deaf community. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4656.1s)]
*  I mean, the thing is, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4658.7s)]
*  the deaf community had a, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4661.820000000001s)]
*  and I don't speak for the deaf community obviously, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4663.820000000001s)]
*  but I can speak from my own experience. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4665.62s)]
*  My mother has a cochlear implant. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4667.18s)]
*  She got one. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4668.42s)]
*  Because my mom was like, [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4669.26s)]
*  my mom's like an iconoclast and she's like, [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4670.1s)]
*  I'm not gonna allow a taboo in deaf society [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4671.66s)]
*  to keep me from experiencing as much of life [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4674.46s)]
*  as I could possibly experience. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4676.9s)]
*  Of course. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4678.7s)]
*  But in general, especially at the beginning, [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4679.54s)]
*  deaf people hated the idea of a cochlear implant [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4682.02s)]
*  because they do not feel, [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4684.3s)]
*  and I think to some degree I agree with them, [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4686.42s)]
*  that deafness is a disability. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4688.66s)]
*  They feel that what it is, it's a culture. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4690.58s)]
*  I mean, obviously they can't hear. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4695.54s)]
*  That's a disability. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4696.86s)]
*  But the true disability comes from the fact [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4698.02s)]
*  that communication barrier. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4700.46s)]
*  And so to them, they see the cochlear implant [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4702.26s)]
*  as just another imperialist, now a robotic mechanism [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4705.42s)]
*  to make them hearing again. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4709.5s)]
*  But wouldn't that be counterbalanced [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4711.3s)]
*  by the ability to absorb art? [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4712.9800000000005s)]
*  In music? [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4715.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4716.740000000001s)]
*  But how do they hear it? [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4717.9400000000005s)]
*  Do they hear it the way a normal person hears it? [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4718.9400000000005s)]
*  Well, I can tell you in section two of the book, [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4721.22s)]
*  my rave years, what kind of music the deaf like [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4724.54s)]
*  more than any other in my experience, [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4727.3s)]
*  is definitely slamming techno. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4729.14s)]
*  Really? [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4731.02s)]
*  It's a really simple form to be able to experience [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4732.7s)]
*  and feel is just that boom, boom, boom of techno or house. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4735.5s)]
*  They love that. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4740.219999999999s)]
*  One of the best pool players in the world is deaf, [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4741.58s)]
*  and he shuts his hearing aid off when he plays. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4743.62s)]
*  I can totally see that because you're hyper-focused. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4746.0599999999995s)]
*  You're all the way in. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4749.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4750.179999999999s)]
*  I can completely see that. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4751.0199999999995s)]
*  He shuts it off and he just doesn't miss. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4751.86s)]
*  I mean, my mother is still deaf. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4753.46s)]
*  If you met her, you would be like, [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4756.62s)]
*  there would be no part of you that was like, [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4758.219999999999s)]
*  this person isn't deaf. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4759.82s)]
*  She sounds deaf and she signs. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4761.02s)]
*  But she wanted, yeah, to experience. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4764.580000000001s)]
*  But she can hear. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4767.46s)]
*  So when you're old and your brain has set [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4770.06s)]
*  its neural pathways to such a degree [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4773.02s)]
*  that it does not process sound and never has, [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4775.900000000001s)]
*  the cochlear implant, apparently, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4779.06s)]
*  there's no way to reignite an atrophied pathway [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4781.34s)]
*  into a normal hearing system, right? [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4787.42s)]
*  By the way, the cochlear implant, I think, [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4790.5s)]
*  I don't know, I've never had one, obviously. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4792.14s)]
*  It sounds robotic. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4793.94s)]
*  It never sounds like... [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4796.18s)]
*  Which is why they like techno. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4797.22s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4798.62s)]
*  It's simple, it's not like listening to Country Roads. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4800.58s)]
*  Oh, I thought you meant because it connects, [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4803.22s)]
*  it's like a robot music. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4804.82s)]
*  It's easy to follow. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4806.3s)]
*  But I don't even mean people with cochlear implants. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4807.3s)]
*  Deaf people in general, they love raves. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4809.26s)]
*  Because yeah, it's easy to follow. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4810.82s)]
*  You can dance to it. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4812.14s)]
*  You don't have to follow some symphonic kind of like, [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4813.38s)]
*  path or whatever. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4816.5s)]
*  When they're totally deaf, do they feel techno? [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4817.78s)]
*  Definitely. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4821.38s)]
*  Yeah, so where do they feel it? [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4822.22s)]
*  Their feet? [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4823.06s)]
*  I would say probably their genitals mostly. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4823.9s)]
*  Really? [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4825.26s)]
*  No, I don't know, their whole body. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4826.1s)]
*  I mean, you've been to a rave, haven't you? [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4826.9400000000005s)]
*  No. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4828.7s)]
*  You never have? [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4829.54s)]
*  No. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4830.38s)]
*  I wonder if your genitals really do feel it [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4831.22s)]
*  if you couldn't hear. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4832.18s)]
*  I can say if bass is deep enough, [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4833.5s)]
*  you can definitely feel it in your genitals. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4835.02s)]
*  That is true. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4836.58s)]
*  So you'd be just kind of barely moving. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4837.5s)]
*  When I was a big raver and I became eventually [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4840.78s)]
*  like a rave promoter, I was a DJ at raves through the 90s [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4843.06s)]
*  and a nexacy dealer, but that's another story. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4846.54s)]
*  I started when I was about 16, [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4848.7s)]
*  I bought my first set of turntables and a mixer [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4850.5s)]
*  and I was terrible, obviously, like everybody starting out, [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4852.7s)]
*  but you can't play in your headphones DJing really. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4855.3s)]
*  You have to like have it be amplified. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4858.0599999999995s)]
*  And I had a very lucky break in having deaf parents [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4860.0599999999995s)]
*  because I would just set everything all the way to the max [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4864.18s)]
*  and my mom would be like happily studying in the other room [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4866.34s)]
*  and I would just be like train wrecking techno beats. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4868.42s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4871.18s)]
*  How'd your neighbors feel about that? [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4873.0599999999995s)]
*  I didn't have neighbors. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4874.38s)]
*  I live next door to a terrible bar [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4875.22s)]
*  so I could have given a fuck. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4878.34s)]
*  I grew up next to like a real white trash, [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4880.22s)]
*  kind of like wannabe gangster bar. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4882.1s)]
*  That was the energy. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4883.7s)]
*  Yeah, really rough. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4884.9800000000005s)]
*  They'd be like showing off their like sound system [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4886.34s)]
*  and they're like Cutlass Supreme. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4888.34s)]
*  That was the energy. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4890.14s)]
*  Pissing on my front door and shit like that. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4891.7s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4893.860000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4895.18s)]
*  Is this a deaf raver? [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4896.02s)]
*  Deaf rave. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4896.860000000001s)]
*  I'm telling you, I'm not making this up. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4897.7s)]
*  I don't think that's the real music. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4903.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4905.18s)]
*  There's a company, a group called Deaf Rave. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4906.38s)]
*  They host raves for deaf people. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4908.660000000001s)]
*  Well, that's what I'm saying. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4910.5s)]
*  House music and techno music really is actually music [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4911.740000000001s)]
*  that's made for your body rather than your mind, you know? [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4914.42s)]
*  And it's made to move to. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4916.780000000001s)]
*  And so I think for the deaf community, [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4918.06s)]
*  this is like, it is the perfect form. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4920.14s)]
*  And these guys are all deaf. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4924.1s)]
*  That's so cool. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4924.9400000000005s)]
*  You definitely feel the bass for sure. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4926.46s)]
*  I mean, I don't, they have, yeah. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4927.9800000000005s)]
*  There's headphones you can get that transduce sound [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4930.540000000001s)]
*  through your jaw instead of going through your ear. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4934.22s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4936.18s)]
*  But they have to still be able to understand what that. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4937.02s)]
*  That's really fascinating. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4940.18s)]
*  What the frequencies are. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4941.22s)]
*  Speaking of weird surgeries, when my grandma, [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4942.06s)]
*  rather when my mom got the cochlear implant, [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4943.9400000000005s)]
*  it decimated her balance. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4946.22s)]
*  She has not been the same since. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4947.9400000000005s)]
*  She's super wobbly because they took out her inner ear [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4949.5s)]
*  and they put in a robotic cochlea instead. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4953.18s)]
*  And her inner ear, [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4956.54s)]
*  and she wanted to get the other one done. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4957.740000000001s)]
*  And we had to do like a cochlear implant intervention. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4959.54s)]
*  We go, mom, no, you're gonna be in a wheelchair [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4961.9400000000005s)]
*  if you do that. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4964.74s)]
*  Like don't do that. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4965.58s)]
*  So it just wrecks your equilibrium. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4966.419999999999s)]
*  Wrecked hers. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4967.58s)]
*  A lot of people with cochlear implants are doing fine. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4968.419999999999s)]
*  But she, for some reason, you know, I wish, [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4971.58s)]
*  I mean, I love my mom and I, who am I to say [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4974.62s)]
*  that it wasn't worth it? [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4977.0199999999995s)]
*  She says it's worth it to her and it's not my business. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4977.86s)]
*  She wanted to experience in the last quarter of her life, [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4980.099999999999s)]
*  like the sensation of sound. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4982.98s)]
*  And I think like, I get that when you've never experienced [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4984.339999999999s)]
*  something like why you wouldn't walk through that door. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4986.98s)]
*  But to me, I wish she'd never gotten it [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4989.82s)]
*  because now she's like this wobbly older lady [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4991.299999999999s)]
*  and it like scares the shit out of me. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4994.42s)]
*  Is there a way to correct it? [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4995.74s)]
*  The wobbly thing? [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4997.38s)]
*  No. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4998.34s)]
*  They take it out, I mean, they- [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=4999.179999999999s)]
*  Once they do it, that's it? [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5000.0s)]
*  There's nothing they can do to fix it? [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5000.84s)]
*  They literally remove your cochlea [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5002.139999999999s)]
*  and put a robot cochlea in instead. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5003.78s)]
*  So there's no, no, it's irreversible. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5006.66s)]
*  She can't do an MRI either. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5008.74s)]
*  Oh boy, that sucks. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5010.3s)]
*  She can't like do a lot of things [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5011.82s)]
*  because like a piece of machinery [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5013.0199999999995s)]
*  will clunk out of her brain. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5014.82s)]
*  Rip out of her fucking head, right? [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5016.42s)]
*  But yeah, I think that the deaf community is- [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5018.0199999999995s)]
*  You're a link, bro. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5021.0199999999995s)]
*  I wonder how that would work with deaf people. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5021.86s)]
*  I'm sure, oh. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5023.3s)]
*  The new product is called telepathy. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5025.06s)]
*  Let a person control a phone or computer just by thinking. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5027.3s)]
*  Well, I heard about- [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5031.860000000001s)]
*  So what if you think in ASL, [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5033.06s)]
*  then you're not thinking in English. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5034.46s)]
*  I thought the first ones were going to be [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5036.5s)]
*  for people that were injured. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5038.5s)]
*  Oh, to get them out of like a paralysis or something. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5040.900000000001s)]
*  That is someone, but if you were injured, [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5044.06s)]
*  and like Stephen Hawking's, [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5046.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5047.54s)]
*  That would have been perfect for him. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5048.38s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5050.02s)]
*  But what would it do? [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5051.18s)]
*  You would be able to do everything on a computer [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5052.34s)]
*  just by thinking. Oh, it would no longer be robot voice. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5053.9400000000005s)]
*  Right. I see. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5055.3s)]
*  You could type, you could do everything. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5056.14s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5057.9800000000005s)]
*  You could, it says that you could talk faster. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5058.82s)]
*  He said that you could talk faster than an auctioneer. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5062.38s)]
*  With Neuralink. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5065.5s)]
*  Yeah, with Neuralink. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5066.34s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5067.18s)]
*  How fast can you say, get me to Epstein's Island? [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5068.02s)]
*  Ah! [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5069.900000000001s)]
*  How quickly? [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5070.74s)]
*  Get me to Epstein's Island. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5071.9400000000005s)]
*  It took him one minute to write each word. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5074.06s)]
*  Is that true? [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5077.5s)]
*  Yeah, and there was allegations towards the end of his life. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5078.34s)]
*  He married his nurse. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5081.86s)]
*  His story is crazy, cause I have a bit on him, [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5083.0199999999995s)]
*  and I've been researching him over the last few weeks. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5085.339999999999s)]
*  His story is nuts. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5088.179999999999s)]
*  He was, most people that have that disease, [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5089.82s)]
*  Lou Gehrig's disease, they die within two years. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5093.38s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5095.259999999999s)]
*  He lived like 55 years. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5096.099999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5096.92s)]
*  And by the end of his life, [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5097.759999999999s)]
*  all he could do was move his cheek muscles. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5098.74s)]
*  That was all that moved. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5101.74s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5102.98s)]
*  So he could move his cheek muscles, [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5103.82s)]
*  and he would use the cheek muscle control cursor, [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5104.66s)]
*  and he would select letters on a screen. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5107.299999999999s)]
*  Is there any reason why he survived, [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5109.54s)]
*  or is it just full on luck of the draw? [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5113.0199999999995s)]
*  Probably luck of the draw, I mean, access to great medicine. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5115.38s)]
*  I mean, he's- [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5119.0199999999995s)]
*  Right, well there's a, I kind of feel like sometimes- [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5119.86s)]
*  Famous scientist. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5121.86s)]
*  There's some part of me that believes like, [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5123.14s)]
*  until the Epstein Island story broke, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5125.18s)]
*  that it was like a gift from the universe or something. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5127.94s)]
*  Well the thing about the Epstein Island thing is, [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5129.98s)]
*  there were a lot of scientists [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5132.22s)]
*  that got lured onto that island. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5133.78s)]
*  And imagine if you're a scientist. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5135.46s)]
*  Let's say you're a physicist, [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5137.26s)]
*  and someone contacts you and says, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5138.46s)]
*  Moshe, would you like to go meet this guy, that guy, [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5140.62s)]
*  and that guy on a retreat? [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5143.62s)]
*  You know, like, oh, these guys are super legit. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5145.18s)]
*  This must be legit. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5146.78s)]
*  You know, you're over there studying the cosmos. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5148.22s)]
*  How much time are you Googling Jeffrey Epstein? [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5150.3s)]
*  That's why I always hate these things. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5152.3s)]
*  And in the beginning, no one really had reason to believe [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5153.14s)]
*  that he was doing anything wrong with all these things, [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5157.12s)]
*  until he got arrested. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5159.22s)]
*  That's why I always hate these things where they go, [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5160.74s)]
*  you took a picture with so and so, therefore you're, [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5162.34s)]
*  it's like, what does that have to, [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5164.58s)]
*  I don't, you have to take a picture [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5165.42s)]
*  with a thousand people a day. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5166.54s)]
*  Like, what does, I have no, [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5167.58s)]
*  I'm not Googling everybody I do a picture with. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5168.82s)]
*  Right, especially if you just meet someone at a show [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5170.62s)]
*  or something like that, it's insane. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5172.58s)]
*  But also, you know, with these people, these scientists, [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5174.08s)]
*  like, that's a really sneaky trick [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5177.54s)]
*  to get a bunch of prominent people together [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5180.64s)]
*  and then invite you to be with those prominent people. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5182.98s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5185.3s)]
*  And it's a good intelligence operation move. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5186.14s)]
*  I mean, if I was an intelligence operative, [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5189.0s)]
*  that's how I would compromise people. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5191.3s)]
*  Oh, you think, there's a party that thinks [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5193.62s)]
*  maybe they were lured there, not just duplicitously, [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5195.78s)]
*  but in order to take them down. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5199.54s)]
*  100%, not to take them down, to have their influence. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5201.099999999999s)]
*  I see, to triangulate them into, [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5204.139999999999s)]
*  you'll do what I want you to do kind of a thing. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5205.74s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5208.66s)]
*  You will support Israel no matter what, [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5209.5s)]
*  you will do this, you will do that, [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5212.5s)]
*  you will, the CIA will tell you to do something, you do it. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5213.94s)]
*  You know, if you're a person that has [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5217.38s)]
*  an enormous amount of influence in a field of science, [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5219.219999999999s)]
*  that's a very valuable person to have on your hand [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5222.3s)]
*  if you ever have something where someone has to speak [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5225.26s)]
*  to the general public. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5228.38s)]
*  You get this expert, and this expert has an opinion [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5230.22s)]
*  that's very different than some other people's opinions, [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5233.18s)]
*  and they say, well, then they promote that opinion, [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5236.02s)]
*  this is the person. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5238.34s)]
*  You could do a lot of things, [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5239.900000000001s)]
*  especially if you have a lot of them. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5241.34s)]
*  Right, right, so an island's worth? [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5242.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and then you also keep them from criticizing you, [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5245.62s)]
*  you keep them from talking about it, [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5249.3s)]
*  you know, you essentially muzzle them [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5251.34s)]
*  into this very complex sort of scheme that was running [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5253.38s)]
*  where they were compromising all these people. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5257.34s)]
*  That's what you think Epstein's Islands was about. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5259.14s)]
*  100%. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5260.7s)]
*  It wasn't like a hedonistic playground, [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5261.54s)]
*  it was actually like a... [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5263.5s)]
*  He was an intelligence agent, most likely. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5264.58s)]
*  Most likely. Interesting. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5267.66s)]
*  Well, Ghislaine Maxwell, [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5268.900000000001s)]
*  her father was an intelligence operative, you know, [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5270.02s)]
*  and he was the one who apparently trained Epstein, [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5272.860000000001s)]
*  supposedly, you know, the whole thing is very convoluted [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5276.18s)]
*  because it's very difficult, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5278.74s)]
*  the stories filled with very wealthy, powerful people [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5280.14s)]
*  who have done a fantastic job [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5283.54s)]
*  of keeping themselves from getting arrested. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5285.38s)]
*  It's pretty wild, like how this has been out in the open, [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5287.860000000001s)]
*  just the murder of Epstein, which seems to be a murder, [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5291.26s)]
*  doesn't seem to be a hanging. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5293.820000000001s)]
*  You ever got upset you weren't invited? [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5295.1s)]
*  No, pretty happy. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5296.820000000001s)]
*  You might have gone. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5299.3s)]
*  I would have gone if I didn't know. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5300.14s)]
*  If you get an email, dude, we got an island, [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5300.9800000000005s)]
*  it's really fun. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5303.06s)]
*  Especially pre-Google. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5303.900000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5305.02s)]
*  Pre-Google, you're like, hey, do you wanna go out, [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5305.860000000001s)]
*  hang out with Stephen Hawkins on an island? [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5307.54s)]
*  I'm like, holy shit. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5309.22s)]
*  But I did used to think, yeah, back to the Hawking thing, [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5310.38s)]
*  that, I don't know, like the universe gave him to us [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5314.34s)]
*  in this weird way. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5317.58s)]
*  Like, here's this mega brilliant genius, [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5318.7s)]
*  I'm not like a big deist in that way, [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5320.54s)]
*  but I think, what are the odds that the smartest man [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5322.46s)]
*  ever to get Lou Gehrig's got to live long enough [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5325.22s)]
*  to give over the full bulk of his genius? [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5327.26s)]
*  There's something very beautiful [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5329.3s)]
*  and interesting about that to me. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5330.42s)]
*  Well yeah, that's a good point, [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5332.06s)]
*  that that guy who had so much to give, [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5333.66s)]
*  lived so long with the disease, it killed so quickly. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5336.14s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he was apparently, he was paralyzed, [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5339.9800000000005s)]
*  he couldn't move, but he could feel. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5344.54s)]
*  So that's why he liked girls. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5346.900000000001s)]
*  And there's a crazy article, I forget what magazine, [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5348.46s)]
*  Variety maybe? [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5351.660000000001s)]
*  No, I forget the magazine. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5354.1s)]
*  But they were talking about, he was like a frequent visitor [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5356.34s)]
*  to strip clubs, he would go to like swingers places. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5359.22s)]
*  Imagine being the stripper when Hawking comes in. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5362.38s)]
*  She probably didn't know who he is, you know? [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5366.26s)]
*  That's possibly not true. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5369.74s)]
*  Fucked up old guy. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5371.179999999999s)]
*  If you're 22 years old and your stage name is Lexus, [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5373.139999999999s)]
*  what are the odds that you know who Stephen Hawking is? [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5376.0599999999995s)]
*  I mean, he's pretty famous, pretty famous guy. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5380.0599999999995s)]
*  Pretty famous for people that care about those things. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5381.82s)]
*  I think Lexus cared. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5384.379999999999s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5385.82s)]
*  I think you're. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5386.66s)]
*  Perhaps. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5387.48s)]
*  Cut Lexus some slack. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5388.32s)]
*  Maybe, maybe Lexus is just, [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5389.98s)]
*  you know, dancing away through school. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5391.98s)]
*  That's right. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5393.46s)]

*  I think the Hawking thing is a strange story, [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5395.86s)]
*  but it's the whole island thing is a strange story. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5400.42s)]
*  It's a strange story. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5403.62s)]
*  It's a story that is one of those things [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5404.62s)]
*  where you go and like, this sounds like the plot of a movie. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5406.299999999999s)]
*  How could this really be how they did it? [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5410.339999999999s)]
*  You know? [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5412.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5413.44s)]
*  Yeah, that movie will come out. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5414.28s)]
*  Who plays Epstein? [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5415.94s)]
*  That's a good question. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5417.339999999999s)]
*  I got a pitch. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5419.86s)]
*  Alec Baldwin. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5420.7s)]
*  Yeah, Baldwin would be good. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5421.54s)]
*  He'd be a little too big. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5422.98s)]
*  I have a little stink on him right now. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5424.82s)]
*  There's a little stink on Epstein too. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5427.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean, maybe too much for him to get the part. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5429.58s)]
*  Sure. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5432.66s)]
*  You would want someone to, who would do it? [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5433.5s)]
*  Oh, Bradley Cooper. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5435.46s)]
*  He could do it. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5436.94s)]
*  Oh, BC. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5437.78s)]
*  He's a good guy at assuming new characters. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5438.74s)]
*  Two great Jewish heroes. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5441.5s)]
*  It goes from Maestro to Epstein's island. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5443.179999999999s)]
*  Shh. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5446.62s)]
*  Well, he played, he's played a lot of people. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5449.9s)]
*  Who else would be good? [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5453.38s)]
*  Christian Bale. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5454.22s)]
*  He could do anything. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5455.18s)]
*  Christian Bale is the best of us. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5456.34s)]
*  Have you seen Poor Things? [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5457.54s)]
*  No, I haven't. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5459.14s)]
*  Emma Stone is the best actor in the world. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5460.02s)]
*  Really? [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5462.1s)]
*  I'm on record now. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5462.9400000000005s)]
*  Wow. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5463.76s)]
*  Poor Things was great. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5464.6s)]
*  Other than Daniel Day-Lewis? [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5465.780000000001s)]
*  Well, DDL is, he is retired. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5467.5s)]
*  Is he? [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5470.62s)]
*  He's still retired? [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5471.46s)]
*  I think so. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5472.3s)]
*  I feel like he's about to come out. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5473.12s)]
*  Do you think he's about to drop a new mix date? [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5473.96s)]
*  It's like Floyd Mayweather. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5474.8s)]
*  He's ready to get back in there. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5475.64s)]
*  Now that is a pay-per-view that I would pay for. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5477.58s)]
*  Daniel Day-Lewis versus Floyd Mayweather. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5480.46s)]
*  I bet if you gave Daniel Day-Lewis long enough, [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5483.04s)]
*  he'd learn how to, he was really good [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5485.08s)]
*  in a movie called The Boxer. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5486.84s)]
*  It was about an IRA guy who got out of jail. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5488.84s)]
*  And he looked like a real, legitimate boxer. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5491.56s)]
*  He trained for an entire year in a boxing gym. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5494.4s)]
*  That's all he did before he, you know, before they filmed. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5497.74s)]
*  So he went to a boxing gym [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5501.12s)]
*  and he essentially was there every day. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5502.6s)]
*  You know, he had to be called Mr. President [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5504.42s)]
*  on set of Lincoln? [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5506.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5507.2s)]
*  Including to like the security guard. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5508.04s)]
*  There was like some older security guard [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5509.38s)]
*  that like just had got hired that day. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5510.68s)]
*  Yeah, he was all in. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5512.24s)]
*  He was all, but those kind of people are so insufferable. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5513.12s)]
*  And then you look at their performance, you go, [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5516.24s)]
*  I don't know, I guess it's worth it. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5517.639999999999s)]
*  Like it's, I think it's gotta be worth it. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5518.82s)]
*  I would not want to be around him [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5521.16s)]
*  during the There Will Be Blood movie. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5522.599999999999s)]
*  No, definitely not. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5524.719999999999s)]
*  Fuck that. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5525.84s)]
*  I just saw In the Name of the Father again. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5526.66s)]
*  Have you seen that? [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5528.12s)]
*  It's one of his earlier movies. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5529.44s)]
*  It's like an IRA story about. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5531.28s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5533.04s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5533.88s)]
*  Such a good fucking movie. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5534.7s)]
*  He's so good. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5535.54s)]
*  He's got no duds. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5536.76s)]
*  Is that true? [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5538.46s)]
*  I don't know if any duds. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5539.3s)]
*  Yeah, I guess you're right. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5540.4s)]
*  I don't think he's got any duds. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5542.34s)]
*  Oh, that's such a good movie. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5543.179999999999s)]
*  I love this movie. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5544.0199999999995s)]
*  Last of the Mohicans was great too. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5545.46s)]
*  No, he was great. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5548.34s)]
*  He's great in everything. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5549.179999999999s)]
*  So I mean. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5550.0s)]
*  He decided to start making shoes. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5550.84s)]
*  Is that true? [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5552.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he became a cobbler. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5552.98s)]
*  He went too deep into the Phantom Thread. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5553.8s)]
*  No, he just decided that's what he feels [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5555.54s)]
*  like doing right now. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5557.259999999999s)]
*  Well, I think it's time for me [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5558.099999999999s)]
*  to reveal something to you, Joe. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5558.94s)]
*  Official statement. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5559.78s)]
*  Daniel Day-Lewis will no longer be working as an actor. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5561.0199999999995s)]
*  He is immensely grateful to all his collaborators [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5563.98s)]
*  and audiences over the many years. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5566.5599999999995s)]
*  This is a private decision, [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5568.099999999999s)]
*  and neither he nor his representatives [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5569.3s)]
*  will make any further comment on the subject. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5572.14s)]
*  Why be so mysterious? [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5573.46s)]
*  And also, what is this office building? [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5574.74s)]
*  Is that Photoshopped? [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5576.58s)]
*  I think someone made this account on Instagram [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5577.82s)]
*  and just put this up. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5580.3s)]
*  DDL. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5582.22s)]
*  I don't imagine that's by him. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5583.06s)]
*  Yeah, I would not imagine that he has an Instagram. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5585.98s)]
*  So yeah, those boots you liked so much, Joe? [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5589.18s)]
*  Those are DDLs. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5591.9s)]
*  Nice. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5592.74s)]
*  That's right. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5593.58s)]
*  DDLs. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5594.4s)]
*  I was gonna get us to this conversational point [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5595.24s)]
*  at some point today. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5596.34s)]
*  That would be a dope brand. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5597.18s)]
*  If Daniel Day-Lewis started actually selling things. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5599.66s)]
*  I would buy Daniel Day-Lewis' shoes. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5602.98s)]
*  100% you'd be the coolest guy in the fucking room. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5604.82s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5606.58s)]
*  But yeah, Emma Stone in Port Things, she's the new one. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5607.58s)]
*  Is he still a cobbler? [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5610.42s)]
*  Does he sell shoes, or does he just make them? [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5612.98s)]
*  He might be one of those dudes who just make shoes. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5614.7s)]
*  You wanna hear a crazy cobbler port [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5616.3s)]
*  to the conversation we were talking about earlier. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5620.54s)]
*  20 years ago? [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5622.38s)]
*  Yeah, after the boxer. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5623.22s)]
*  He secretly made all of them. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5625.02s)]
*  Secretly made shoes, 96 to 97. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5626.78s)]
*  My mother learned sign language because of a cobbler. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5630.22s)]
*  So my grandma had her in an oral school, [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5636.5s)]
*  and she was failing, and she was isolated, [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5639.9800000000005s)]
*  and had no friends. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5642.26s)]
*  And my grandma went to get her shoes fixed at this cobbler, [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5643.54s)]
*  and he happened to be deaf, randomly. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5647.74s)]
*  And my grandma was talking to, [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5650.900000000001s)]
*  passing notes back and forth with him, [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5653.22s)]
*  and he said that he'd never learned sign language, [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5654.78s)]
*  and that he didn't have any friends, [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5657.3s)]
*  and that he didn't have any access to the world, [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5659.62s)]
*  and he was just this lonely cobbler. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5662.46s)]
*  And that was the day that my grandma pulled her [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5664.02s)]
*  out of an oral school, [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5666.9800000000005s)]
*  and sent her to the school for the deaf [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5667.820000000001s)]
*  to learn sign language. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5669.02s)]
*  Wow. All because of a cobbler. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5669.860000000001s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5671.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's a wild one. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5672.02s)]
*  Do you believe in synchronicities? [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5673.780000000001s)]
*  These things happen on purpose? [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5676.1s)]
*  That there's some sort of a destiny to life? [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5678.06s)]
*  I can tell you that I've been thinking about destiny a lot. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5681.820000000001s)]
*  She was the other stripper at the strip club, [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5684.900000000001s)]
*  no, I've been thinking about destiny a lot [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5687.38s)]
*  because of this book. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5688.7s)]
*  Because these are worlds, [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5690.14s)]
*  all of these worlds that I write about in this book, [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5691.98s)]
*  like deafness and Hasidic Judaism and AA and raves [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5693.9s)]
*  and Burning Man and Stand Up, [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5696.7s)]
*  they don't go together except through my body, [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5699.22s)]
*  like through me, I'm the connective tissue. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5701.7s)]
*  And having written this book, [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5704.18s)]
*  I guess I'm in middle age or something like that. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5706.94s)]
*  If you're lucky. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5710.34s)]
*  If I'm lucky, yes, amen. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5711.18s)]
*  May I be so lucky. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5712.5s)]
*  I'm looking back and going like, [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5714.5s)]
*  this whole thing was a path [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5716.62s)]
*  and there is no way to see destiny. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5719.06s)]
*  I don't believe in destiny looking forward. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5721.22s)]
*  I believe in destiny looking back. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5723.14s)]
*  Like everywhere you land is destiny in this weird way [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5724.54s)]
*  because it never could have been anything else. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5729.38s)]
*  I have all these, and I'm sure you do too, [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5731.3s)]
*  these portals in my life. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5733.3s)]
*  You could have been a pool hustler only. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5734.42s)]
*  You could have been, [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5736.66s)]
*  and you could have gone to the pool hustler thing [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5737.62s)]
*  and then gotten shot and died at 25. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5739.22s)]
*  There's all these multiverse possibilities [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5742.379999999999s)]
*  of the Moshe that wasn't. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5744.98s)]
*  And the Moshe that was was always headed in this direction. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5746.46s)]
*  Think about Stand Up. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5750.94s)]
*  The only reason I started Stand Up [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5751.82s)]
*  is because I was in Israel doing a semester abroad [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5753.62s)]
*  and it was in the second Intifada and it got shut down. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5756.5s)]
*  I just decided randomly to go to New York [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5760.0599999999995s)]
*  and I happened to have a friend who I'd kept in touch with [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5763.219999999999s)]
*  who was doing Stand Up. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5766.58s)]
*  And she brought me to a show that night. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5767.46s)]
*  I saw Patrice and Sarah Silverman. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5769.98s)]
*  I had never even thought Stand Up in my life. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5772.94s)]
*  I'd seen Delirious or I watched Janine's special on it, [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5776.46s)]
*  but I didn't care. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5780.9s)]
*  Stand Up wasn't part of my thing, [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5781.74s)]
*  but I saw them doing their thing [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5783.46s)]
*  and I was like, I couldn't believe it. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5785.7s)]
*  I'd been writing long form monologues [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5787.74s)]
*  and wanting to be an actor. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5789.78s)]
*  I didn't know what I wanted to do. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5791.1s)]
*  I wanted to write plays maybe. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5792.22s)]
*  I wanted to be a historian. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5793.78s)]
*  I just didn't know. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5794.74s)]
*  And then I saw them. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5795.58s)]
*  How old were you? [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5796.42s)]
*  I was 21. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5797.24s)]
*  And I go, first of all, [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5800.34s)]
*  Patrice was making fun of Michael J. Fox [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5802.74s)]
*  and it was the week that his Parkinson's had been. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5805.3s)]
*  And I was like, I couldn't believe. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5807.9s)]
*  It felt illegal. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5810.58s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5812.58s)]
*  I was just like, how can this be? [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5813.98s)]
*  And then Sarah went on and she was transgressive [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5817.42s)]
*  in this way that was like, anyway, I go, wow, that's crazy. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5820.02s)]
*  And then the next night, my friend was doing a set [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5822.98s)]
*  and I went and saw her and she was funny. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5825.26s)]
*  I go, what the hell? [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5827.34s)]
*  She's a human being. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5828.5s)]
*  These are gods that I just saw last night. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5829.68s)]
*  But this is a person. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5831.82s)]
*  She's like me. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5832.66s)]
*  So I said to her, when you come to the Bay, [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5833.5s)]
*  I'll write five minutes of material. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5835.42s)]
*  Take me to an open mic. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5836.74s)]
*  I go to the open mic. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5837.86s)]
*  I do the open mic. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5838.74s)]
*  It goes pretty well. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5839.58s)]
*  And then I just, my destiny was set. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5840.42s)]
*  Now here I am. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5842.94s)]
*  It's 20 years later. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5843.9s)]
*  I just wrote my second book. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5845.18s)]
*  I'm talking to you. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5846.5s)]
*  I got a wife at home who's a comic [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5847.58s)]
*  who I met in comedy clubs. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5849.14s)]
*  I have a child at home that's a result [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5850.42s)]
*  of the connection that the two of us have. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5852.0s)]
*  I can't even look back and think about the other lives [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5854.74s)]
*  that it could have been, [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5857.74s)]
*  because it's like that to me is destiny, [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5858.58s)]
*  is looking back and going. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5860.54s)]
*  I was like, I don't know how. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5862.219999999999s)]
*  I don't know how raves to Burning Man to deafness [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5863.86s)]
*  to Hasidic Judaism to AA to stand up led here, [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5865.86s)]
*  but it was always leading here. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5869.139999999999s)]
*  This is where I was going. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5870.46s)]
*  Do you believe in the multiverse? [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5872.179999999999s)]
*  Do you believe that there's infinite numbers of you [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5874.0199999999995s)]
*  living in different directions [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5876.86s)]
*  and infinite possibilities that happen? [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5878.62s)]
*  Because that's what, [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5880.3s)]
*  if the people that believe that we live in one channel [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5881.98s)]
*  of essentially what's an infinite radio dial, [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5887.78s)]
*  that's why you can only exist in the moment really. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5892.7s)]
*  Because it's only one thing going. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5895.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's only one thing going and it can go any way. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5897.74s)]
*  And if there's an infinite number of you out there, [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5901.9s)]
*  which it likely, the way the universe is, [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5905.42s)]
*  if you talk to people that actually understand [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5910.94s)]
*  the scope of infinity, they will tell you that [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5914.0599999999995s)]
*  not only do humans exist, but you exist. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5916.9s)]
*  And not only do you exist, but you exist in the form [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5922.099999999999s)]
*  where you have done everything that you have done [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5925.66s)]
*  on this earth, you Moshe, the guy I'm talking to right now, [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5928.54s)]
*  there's an infinite number of you. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5931.42s)]
*  Doing the same thing. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5933.82s)]
*  That have done that. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5934.66s)]
*  Exactly, every pause that you've made. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5935.5s)]
*  And then there's an infinite number of ones [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5938.5s)]
*  who made different choices. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5940.299999999999s)]
*  And it's an infinite number of different choices [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5942.0199999999995s)]
*  that they have made at every single moment [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5944.1s)]
*  of every single step of their life. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5946.780000000001s)]
*  That's how big infinity is. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5949.14s)]
*  What is the, I guess there is no purpose in that. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5950.9400000000005s)]
*  It's like, it's like. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5954.18s)]
*  I don't know, there still might be a purpose. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5955.620000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5957.14s)]
*  There's definitely a purpose to the people [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5957.9800000000005s)]
*  that exist in the moment, that exist in this time [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5959.58s)]
*  that we're sharing. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5962.14s)]
*  So if that is real and it is felt by all of us, [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5963.56s)]

*  there's definitely, there's a meaning to it. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5972.98s)]
*  It's what does that do? [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5975.82s)]
*  And what are these moments? [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5978.48s)]
*  And what is the powerful emotion of love [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5980.68s)]
*  and the way people feel when they hear great music [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5985.18s)]

*  What is that doing? [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5993.34s)]
*  Like it's expressing energy. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5995.18s)]
*  It's expressing the universe in some weird way [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=5998.34s)]

*  And I can't think that there's not a meaning to it [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6021.3s)]

*  that they go through too. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6039.46s)]
*  And some of my, by the way, some of my path [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6040.66s)]
*  was paved with tragedy. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6042.66s)]
*  And that's to me the history of the Jews [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6044.3s)]
*  is like this sort of triumphant story [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6047.26s)]
*  that's like pockmarked with insane tragedy all the time [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6049.18s)]
*  and then you just keep going and keep surviving. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6052.780000000001s)]
*  If you believe in destiny like I was headed here [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6055.26s)]

*  And if you believe in randomness, [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6060.34s)]
*  like there was no meaning, there was no, [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6062.18s)]

*  you would take it and be like what the fuck is this? [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6077.5s)]
*  Well even to exist at all, scientifically, [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6081.3s)]

*  Unlikely. Unlikely. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6086.900000000001s)]
*  You were the perfect amount of distance from the sun [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6088.34s)]
*  to have an ozone layer and an atmosphere [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6090.74s)]

*  in the human version where you're not just like [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6096.5s)]
*  a sustenance like the pig that you shot. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6098.9800000000005s)]
*  You could have been the pig that you shot, [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6101.22s)]
*  the funky pig. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6102.62s)]
*  That is such a rare, it feels so common [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6106.18s)]
*  if you don't pay attention to the beauty in your life. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6109.3s)]
*  It can feel so common and banal [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6111.46s)]
*  and life is boring and meaningless. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6113.18s)]
*  And if you turn around, if I turn around [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6115.22s)]
*  and look at the kind of magic of this existence [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6117.860000000001s)]
*  and this incarnation, and that's why I love life so much. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6122.1s)]
*  That's to me, the book is about my desire to like, [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6126.06s)]
*  when I die, I wanna squeeze the last drop [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6131.54s)]

*  It's not Judaism, it's fun. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6142.98s)]
*  It's experiences, it's like love and the connection, [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6144.42s)]
*  talking to you, going on stage, writing a book, [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6148.0199999999995s)]
*  having a family, like I feel super overpaid and lucky. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6150.9s)]
*  And cause a lot of my friends that I grew up with are dead. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6155.179999999999s)]

*  Sure, could have been all of us. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6160.34s)]
*  There's a lot of decisions you could have made [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6162.38s)]

*  Yeah, me and Pete Holmes, we were talking about it, [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6167.1s)]
*  he was calling it spiritual plinko. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6168.9800000000005s)]
*  Like it just could have plinked in a different direction [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6172.14s)]
*  and you'd be a different guy. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6174.54s)]
*  You go on a car ride one day, you're in an accident, [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6175.6s)]
*  you go on a car ride the other day, [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6177.9800000000005s)]
*  you win the Nobel Prize. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6179.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you tie your shoes before you leave the house [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6180.54s)]
*  and you avoid an accident. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6183.660000000001s)]
*  Or you tie your shoes and you get into an accident. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6185.06s)]
*  So I think, yeah, that is what you're talking about, [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6187.620000000001s)]
*  living in the moment. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6189.46s)]
*  Because there's so many possibilities that, [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6190.46s)]
*  if you believe it one way, are happening [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6192.58s)]
*  or could happen to you, then fear is, [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6194.98s)]
*  I mean I live in fear sometimes [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6197.74s)]
*  and it's like this is so pointless. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6199.099999999999s)]
*  Because it's the thing with my daughter. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6200.48s)]
*  The thing you're protecting her against, [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6202.12s)]
*  you're not protecting her against the actual thing [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6203.459999999999s)]
*  that will harm her and vice versa. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6204.98s)]
*  Well that's the thing about anxiety, right? [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6206.62s)]
*  It's preparing for something that hasn't happened. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6208.259999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6210.54s)]
*  That's what freaks people out. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6211.379999999999s)]
*  I think a lot of time it affects very smart people too [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6212.419999999999s)]
*  because they take into account all the possible scenarios [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6214.9s)]
*  that could take place. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6217.9s)]
*  All the variables. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6219.179999999999s)]
*  I always would tell people when I was teaching, [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6221.259999999999s)]
*  when I was teaching martial arts, [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6224.12s)]
*  when I'd have people compete, [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6225.16s)]
*  I'd take them to tournaments, [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6226.28s)]
*  I'd be like the reason why you're so nervous [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6227.66s)]
*  is because you're smart. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6230.34s)]
*  The last thing you wanna be is not nervous right now. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6232.04s)]
*  Because nerves are gonna save you. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6234.36s)]
*  It's a terrible feeling but you're gonna get over it. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6235.82s)]
*  But those nerves exist because you're aware [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6238.36s)]
*  of the variables. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6240.44s)]
*  You're aware of the possibilities. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6241.72s)]
*  You're aware of the danger of it all. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6243.08s)]
*  A delusional, stupid person who's just confident, [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6244.82s)]
*  they can win. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6247.84s)]
*  It's possible. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6249.4s)]
*  They can still win. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6250.24s)]
*  And they can have no nerves at all. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6251.5599999999995s)]
*  They can go in there and kick everybody's ass. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6253.32s)]
*  But you're better off being aware of what this is. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6255.0s)]
*  Your senses will be heightened [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6259.12s)]
*  as long as you're not overwhelmed by fear. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6261.62s)]
*  You're saying fear is beneficial in that way. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6263.679999999999s)]
*  100%. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6265.44s)]

*  Oh, that's great. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6272.08s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, totally. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6274.48s)]
*  I mean the thing that happens [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6275.639999999999s)]
*  is when people become worshipful of their fear [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6277.16s)]

*  and experience life. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6282.0s)]
*  They're so afraid of the disastrous possibilities of life [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6283.400000000001s)]
*  that they forget to live a life. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6286.6s)]
*  And I will say I'm not free of fear at all. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6288.24s)]
*  I feel it all the time. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6291.56s)]
*  You're a human being. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6292.400000000001s)]
*  It's impossible to not be. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6293.24s)]
*  Also you live in LA. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6294.2s)]
*  And you got a bitch for a dog. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6295.24s)]
*  It's possible to bitch. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6297.4400000000005s)]
*  It's also possible to betray me [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6300.96s)]
*  because it's a German shepherd. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6302.32s)]
*  And it's like I wasn't trained to protect Jews. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6303.360000000001s)]
*  Oh, good point. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6305.84s)]
*  Okay, I got you. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6307.2s)]
*  Yes. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6308.04s)]
*  Good point. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6308.88s)]
*  It's like, no he's a sweetheart. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6309.7s)]
*  George Foreman had a German shepherd [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6311.16s)]
*  and when he had a German shepherd [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6313.44s)]
*  and he brought it to Africa [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6314.96s)]
*  when he's fighting Muhammad Ali, [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6316.92s)]
*  they were very distrustful of him. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6318.639999999999s)]
*  Because of the dog? [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6320.599999999999s)]
*  Because he had a dog that they used to sick on black people. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6321.44s)]
*  Wow. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6324.72s)]
*  So when he was bringing this dog, [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6325.5599999999995s)]
*  this guy was bringing a dog that they recognized [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6327.48s)]
*  as the enemy, [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6329.96s)]
*  there was a lot of people that were very distrustful of him. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6330.8s)]
*  Oh, that's really interesting. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6332.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6333.8s)]
*  He should have brought my dog. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6334.639999999999s)]
*  So that helped Ali. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6335.72s)]
*  If he brought my dog, [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6337.24s)]
*  it would have created unity in South Africa. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6338.08s)]
*  They still wouldn't have trusted it. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6340.6s)]
*  It's the breed. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6342.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6343.6s)]
*  That thing's sweet. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6344.4400000000005s)]
*  I love him. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6345.26s)]
*  They didn't have those breeds back then though. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6346.1s)]
*  They only had one kind of German shepherd. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6347.52s)]
*  You ever see what German shepherds look like [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6348.96s)]
*  over the years? [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6350.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6351.16s)]
*  Because they're trying to make them for show dogs, [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6352.0s)]
*  their hips have dropped. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6353.6s)]
*  Right. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6354.92s)]
*  And they look different. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6355.76s)]
*  If you go to like a German shepherd from like 1930 [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6356.6s)]
*  and then look at a German shepherd from 2023, [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6359.320000000001s)]
*  it's a different animal. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6362.2s)]
*  They're just sloping. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6363.360000000001s)]
*  You know that bulldogs can't, [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6364.4400000000005s)]
*  true bulldogs like MCA or whatever. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6366.4800000000005s)]
*  Jamie's dog can't fuck. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6368.76s)]
*  They can't, and they only give birth, [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6370.08s)]
*  they only give caesarian birth. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6372.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think Jamie's dog can't breed normally. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6373.8s)]
*  You gotta use the turkey baster. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6376.68s)]
*  But neither can Marshall. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6378.12s)]
*  I haven't tried. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6379.280000000001s)]
*  Marshall can if I let him. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6380.12s)]
*  Yeah, the problem is you won't let him. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6380.96s)]
*  Well, he was always gonna want. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6382.84s)]
*  He texted me on the way here. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6384.16s)]
*  He said to talk to Joe, see if I can get some ass. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6385.320000000001s)]
*  I would definitely find a good lady [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6387.08s)]
*  that would have to have homes for all the puppies. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6389.04s)]
*  But you know, it's the thing about dogs. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6392.96s)]
*  Like you're not saying I want my dog to have sex. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6395.96s)]
*  You're saying I want my dog to procreate. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6398.88s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6400.08s)]
*  That's a different thing. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6401.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6402.759999999999s)]
*  They can't, right, they don't do it for, [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6405.12s)]
*  I think about that a lot too. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6406.599999999999s)]
*  That human beings, by the way, [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6408.32s)]
*  I think this is a great and lucky incarnation [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6410.04s)]
*  to be a human, really good. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6412.4s)]
*  But it's also, humans are, [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6413.759999999999s)]
*  we have warped evolution to such a degree. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6415.599999999999s)]
*  Like we shouldn't be hung up about stuff. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6418.679999999999s)]
*  We can't have, sex is so simple for every other animal. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6421.44s)]
*  It's just like I get in there, boom, I got a baby. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6424.759999999999s)]
*  And we're over here going like, [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6426.719999999999s)]
*  covered in clothes, which is just a bizarre invention. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6428.68s)]
*  What a bizarre thing we've done to our bodies [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6432.68s)]
*  where we can no longer exist in the atmosphere, [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6435.36s)]
*  even if it's warm, people wear clothes. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6437.72s)]
*  Like it's become a thing where you're shielding [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6440.96s)]
*  your genitals from the other people [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6444.0s)]
*  because they represent your sex. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6445.76s)]
*  Well, also though, I have heard that when people, [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6448.08s)]
*  when uncontacted tribes, really like old school, [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6453.0s)]
*  sustenance living sort of iron age level tribes [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6458.92s)]
*  come out of isolation and decide to join the world, [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6460.56s)]
*  a big part, what they want is clothes. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6463.64s)]
*  I think it might be really cold out there, just in life. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6467.08s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6470.04s)]
*  With no clothes. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6471.0s)]
*  Well, it definitely is sometimes. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6471.84s)]
*  It's not perfect all the time, [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6473.36s)]
*  but I think that's why we used to be hairy. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6475.72s)]
*  Right, I still have some of that, it doesn't seem to help. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6477.56s)]
*  I mean, there's some fucking dudes in Russia. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6479.88s)]
*  There's some Russian wrestlers that look like, [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6482.04s)]
*  they look like a human lived 200,000 years ago looked like. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6485.0s)]
*  They're fucking covered in hair, like everything. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6490.08s)]
*  Their neck all the way through their back, [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6492.76s)]
*  their chest, their arms, full thick hair. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6494.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6497.04s)]
*  It's like, that's probably what we were like. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6497.88s)]
*  You ever seen a real heavy, hairy Russian wrestler? [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6500.2s)]
*  Sure, I mean. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6502.96s)]
*  Look at this dude. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6503.8s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's my guy right there. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6505.0s)]
*  I mean, this is a man that exists right now. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6505.84s)]
*  But he doesn't look like he would stay warm in the winter. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6507.92s)]
*  No, no, no, because it used to be a lot thicker. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6510.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6512.6s)]
*  That was slowly over time when we chose to wear clothes, [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6513.44s)]
*  we invented clothes and chose to wear clothes. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6518.0s)]
*  I think slowly over time, people lost all their body hair. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6519.96s)]
*  But I think at one point in time, [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6522.839999999999s)]
*  when you see these really, go to that other picture of him [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6523.96s)]
*  where you see his back and everything. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6526.639999999999s)]
*  That one, that one, perfect, perfect, that one. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6528.16s)]
*  That's a fucking different kind of hair [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6530.5199999999995s)]
*  than the average person has. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6533.28s)]
*  That dude has long hair on his shoulders. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6534.919999999999s)]
*  Do you think that, like if you have more hair, [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6537.44s)]
*  you're older school? [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6541.08s)]
*  Like your genetics are older school? [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6544.08s)]
*  Probably why they're so good at wrestling too. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6546.04s)]
*  They're probably strong as shit. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6547.919999999999s)]
*  That whole thing that we have all, [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6549.599999999999s)]
*  we all have some, a little bit of Neanderthal DNA? [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6550.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I have a shit ton. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6553.24s)]
*  Do you? [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6554.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6555.04s)]
*  Yeah, look at how fucking hairy these dudes are. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6555.879999999999s)]
*  I think this is just the 2023 version. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6558.16s)]
*  I bet if you could go back 200,000 years ago, [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6561.48s)]
*  people were just covered in hair. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6564.719999999999s)]
*  I mean, and that's what they think about [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6566.719999999999s)]
*  like ancient hominids. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6568.12s)]
*  It's not like one day they weren't hairy. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6569.08s)]
*  Do you think I might be like quite a man? [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6571.4s)]
*  Little manly there. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6573.839999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6574.759999999999s)]
*  How's the back? [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6575.599999999999s)]
*  Back is clean, dude. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6576.599999999999s)]
*  I don't know how, I don't know why, it's a blessing. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6577.719999999999s)]
*  I'm telling you, this life is magical. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6580.24s)]
*  I got a hairy back. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6581.92s)]
*  Do you really? [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6582.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6583.679999999999s)]
*  You don't, are you a shaver? [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6584.5199999999995s)]
*  I get my wife to shave my back. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6586.04s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6587.36s)]
*  Can you imagine what would happen [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6588.44s)]
*  if I asked Natasha to shave my back? [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6589.639999999999s)]
*  It would be a problem. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6591.08s)]
*  It would be a no, I can tell you that. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6591.92s)]
*  She would do it with those gloves, [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6596.04s)]
*  the ones that go all the way up to the elbow, [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6597.679999999999s)]
*  and she'd be complaining the entire time. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6599.4s)]
*  It would be hilarious. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6601.88s)]
*  It would be hilarious, she's probably filmed that. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6603.32s)]
*  She would never. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6605.48s)]
*  I cannot even, I love this image though. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6607.92s)]
*  Elbow length glove, she's got a custom made razor [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6609.96s)]
*  with golden pearls on it. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6613.0s)]
*  Face shield. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6614.28s)]
*  Shaving your back. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6616.04s)]
*  Oh yeah, one of the COVID shields. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6616.88s)]
*  Yeah, I get hairy. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6617.96s)]
*  As do I. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6624.08s)]
*  Yeah, I get itchy though too. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6624.92s)]
*  When I get too much hair, it pools up in between my tits [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6626.68s)]
*  and I get itchy. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6629.48s)]
*  Do you shave your arms? [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6630.56s)]
*  No, most of the time not, but I have a few times. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6631.88s)]
*  It makes my tattoos look better. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6635.56s)]
*  I mean, you don't look very hairy from here. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6637.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they're hair, you can see it. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6639.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, close, this is all tattoos. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6641.240000000001s)]
*  My hair, I swear to God, my hair stops here. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6643.280000000001s)]
*  It's like I have a reverse farmer's tan. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6646.080000000001s)]
*  Interesting, maybe your people for the longest time [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6647.96s)]
*  wore short sleeves. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6650.72s)]
*  That could be true. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6652.320000000001s)]
*  That's probably what it was. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6653.84s)]
*  You really think that? [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6654.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I think that's why people have hairy forearms [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6655.52s)]
*  for the most part, but they don't usually [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6658.8s)]
*  have hairy shoulders. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6660.4800000000005s)]
*  I think that's where it comes from. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6662.4400000000005s)]
*  Evolutionarily. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6663.4800000000005s)]
*  I think the whole thing comes from clothes. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6664.320000000001s)]
*  I think our whole adaptation to, [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6665.92s)]
*  I mean, if you look at it, I would imagine urban people, [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6669.6s)]
*  like if collectively, people who've lived [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6672.4800000000005s)]
*  in urban environments for longer periods of time [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6674.8s)]
*  probably have less body hair [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6677.08s)]
*  than if you follow their genetics, [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6680.76s)]
*  than people who live in very cold rural climates, [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6682.6s)]
*  like fucking Canadian men that live in Alberta. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6686.16s)]
*  They're probably hairier dudes. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6689.64s)]
*  It's weird that with what you're talking about, [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6691.0s)]
*  you're kinda talking, in a strange way, [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6693.5199999999995s)]
*  it reminds me of original sin, too. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6695.68s)]
*  It's straight up biblical. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6698.2s)]
*  Right, right, we've lost our abilities. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6699.64s)]
*  The first big event that occurs is something goes wrong [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6701.72s)]
*  and the human becomes aware of its nakedness. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6706.28s)]
*  It's not what, it's what you're talking about. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6709.64s)]
*  It's not about cold, it's about shame. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6711.84s)]
*  What I do believe, in answer to a question [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6715.36s)]
*  you asked me two hours ago, [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6717.4s)]
*  are all of these rules somehow connected to a functional, [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6718.879999999999s)]
*  nearly scientific corollary, right, [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6722.759999999999s)]
*  like trichinosis or whatever. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6725.48s)]
*  I do believe that on some level, [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6727.08s)]
*  every bit of biblical information, [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6728.959999999999s)]
*  every bit of religious information, [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6731.04s)]
*  it has some sort of allegorical and metaphorical connection [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6733.0s)]
*  to our past. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6738.08s)]
*  What does it mean that Adam and Eve saw their nakedness [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6739.2s)]
*  and realized they were naked and decided to cover up? [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6743.36s)]
*  It speaks to like a historical truth. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6745.719999999999s)]
*  Definitely, I don't think Adam and Eve saw their nakedness [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6748.44s)]
*  and were ashamed, but something occurred [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6750.719999999999s)]
*  where we realized we are naked in the world [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6752.719999999999s)]
*  and we must cover because people can't look [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6755.28s)]
*  at what we're doing. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6757.839999999999s)]
*  What just makes sense that once they started wearing clothes, [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6758.679999999999s)]
*  seeing people without clothes [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6760.96s)]
*  would be just this shocking thing. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6762.44s)]
*  I can tell you an exact corollary for that [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6764.12s)]
*  in my personal life. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6766.679999999999s)]
*  When I go to Burning Man, [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6768.08s)]
*  last year was my 24th time at Burning Man. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6769.48s)]
*  Oh my Jesus. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6771.759999999999s)]
*  And you're stone cold sober. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6772.92s)]
*  Stone sober the whole time. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6774.240000000001s)]
*  How dare you? [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6775.320000000001s)]
*  I'm the guy, I'm the designated driver. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6776.72s)]
*  When I get there, a lot of nudity, [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6779.76s)]
*  less so every year as things get [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6783.88s)]
*  a little bit more sanitary there, [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6785.4400000000005s)]
*  but over the years, lots of nudity. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6786.52s)]
*  It was one of the primary characteristics, [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6788.08s)]
*  women running around naked, everybody naked. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6789.4800000000005s)]
*  I will be like zero titillation. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6793.160000000001s)]
*  Like nothing about it is like, [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6795.56s)]
*  Hama no, ooh mama, look at that hot naked lady. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6796.88s)]
*  Because it becomes normal. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6799.92s)]
*  Then I get back to the States, a low cut dress. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6801.52s)]
*  I'm like whoa, look at that over there. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6803.76s)]
*  Oh, a little cleavage. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6805.4400000000005s)]
*  Your mind can adjust based on your circumstances. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6807.4400000000005s)]
*  It's erotic. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6810.56s)]
*  There's zero erotic charge after a week at Burning Man [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6812.120000000001s)]
*  to see a naked woman running by, fully naked. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6814.92s)]
*  Well isn't that why lingerie exists? [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6817.080000000001s)]
*  Because the whole thrill is taking it off. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6819.120000000001s)]
*  The thrill is that it's very sheer [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6821.68s)]
*  and there's very little of it. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6824.040000000001s)]
*  Ooh, look at that. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6825.6s)]
*  I feel that lingerie is a con [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6826.8s)]
*  and that I've never met a man that likes it. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6829.200000000001s)]
*  Do you love it? [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6831.599999999999s)]
*  Get to that in a moment. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6832.44s)]
*  Humans appear relatively hairless [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6833.68s)]
*  compared to our other ape relatives [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6835.68s)]
*  but the density of the hair follicles in our skin [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6837.28s)]

*  of an ape our size. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6841.4s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6842.48s)]
*  The follicle. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6843.32s)]
*  The fine hairs that cover our bodies [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6844.16s)]
*  which have replaced the thicker ones [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6846.24s)]
*  seen in our close relatives [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6848.24s)]
*  are thought to be an evolutionary leftover [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6849.72s)]
*  from our hair ancestors. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6851.8s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6852.84s)]
*  Makes sense. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6854.36s)]
*  Oh, wow, now scientists find these fine hairs [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6855.76s)]
*  are useful after all with people with more of them [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6860.16s)]
*  are better at detecting bed bugs. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6863.599999999999s)]
*  More fine hairs means you're better at detecting bed bugs? [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6866.16s)]
*  Yeah, you probably feel them more. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6868.92s)]
*  Female ancestors preferred a bug free mate [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6871.2s)]
*  and so opted for hairier guys. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6874.68s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6876.84s)]
*  Oh, that's really interesting. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6877.68s)]
*  How weird. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6878.84s)]
*  I've had crabs, you ever have that? [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6879.8s)]
*  No, I have not. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6881.5199999999995s)]
*  I've dodged that bullet. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6882.36s)]
*  The researchers found that body hair significantly enhanced [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6883.32s)]
*  how well people detected the bed bugs [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6885.8s)]
*  which participants noticing the bugs on the hairy arm [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6888.12s)]
*  quicker than they did when tested on the hairless arm. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6891.5599999999995s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6895.12s)]
*  The hair serving as motion detectors. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6895.96s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6898.28s)]
*  The hair also prolonged how long it took the parasites [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6899.599999999999s)]
*  to find places to feed [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6902.76s)]
*  presumably because they hindered movement. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6904.44s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6907.4s)]
*  So wait, it's better to have hair or worse? [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6908.4s)]
*  Yeah, follicles. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6910.36s)]
*  Better to have follicles. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6911.5599999999995s)]
*  You better have some hairs. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6912.5199999999995s)]
*  When I got crabs, I was living with my mother. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6913.88s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6916.76s)]
*  How old were you? [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6918.16s)]
*  I was probably 18, 17, something like that. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6919.0s)]
*  And they tell you at the clinic, [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6922.400000000001s)]
*  they say, anybody that lives with you, [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6923.68s)]
*  you gotta give them this insecticide too. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6926.6s)]
*  Oh, no. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6928.6s)]
*  So you had a sign to your mom that you got crabs? [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6929.4400000000005s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6932.88s)]
*  And she had to slather herself in insecticide [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6934.400000000001s)]
*  and sleep overnight with it. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6936.88s)]
*  How mad was she at you? [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6938.320000000001s)]
*  I'm lucky in that my mom is probably [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6939.68s)]
*  the most sexually open-minded woman in the universe [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6942.360000000001s)]
*  and she was not mad at all. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6945.72s)]
*  I think she thought it was funny. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6948.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, that's cool. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6949.84s)]
*  Yeah, my mom was- [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6950.68s)]
*  What a great mom. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6951.52s)]
*  Very chill about things like that. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6952.360000000001s)]
*  There was a time once- [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6953.52s)]
*  Probably happy you were getting some. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6954.56s)]
*  No, really. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6956.080000000001s)]
*  She used to sit my brother and I down on Tuesday nights [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6957.0s)]
*  and read to us from a book called Boys and Sex. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6959.320000000001s)]
*  And she was just like open. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6961.88s)]
*  When she found porn, when I hit puberty and she found porn, [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6963.56s)]
*  she took the porn and rather than yell at me, [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6967.160000000001s)]
*  she brought me to a lesbian, [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6970.360000000001s)]
*  like a feminist vibrator shop. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6972.4800000000005s)]
*  And she said, you can pick any of the [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6975.24s)]
*  lesbian text-based erotica that you want. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6976.8s)]
*  She wanted to make sure if I was looking at porn, [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6979.72s)]
*  it would have like 90 pages of prose poetry [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6981.8s)]
*  before we got to the good stuff. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6983.84s)]
*  That's the kind of woman my mother was. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6985.5199999999995s)]
*  She didn't care at all. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6986.679999999999s)]
*  Very open-minded. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6989.2s)]
*  Well, that's lucky, especially in the crab situation. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6990.24s)]
*  Well, definitely in that situation. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6993.28s)]
*  The whole idea of VD killing people is so strange. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6995.4s)]
*  But that's a lot of the ways people died back in the day. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=6999.16s)]
*  It was syphilis. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7002.04s)]
*  Right, syphilis. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7002.96s)]
*  You couldn't treat it, right? [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7004.56s)]
*  It was just pre- [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7005.400000000001s)]
*  Something they can do before antibiotics [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7006.24s)]
*  and penicillin and all that shit. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7008.68s)]
*  What the fuck did they do? [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7011.92s)]
*  I mean, that's literally your skin rotted out. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7012.84s)]
*  I've never had any of those. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7015.76s)]
*  I've only had the bugs. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7017.12s)]
*  I don't think people get it anymore. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7019.12s)]
*  If they do get it, they can cure it now. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7020.4400000000005s)]
*  Is that true? [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7021.64s)]
*  No, people must still get it. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7022.4800000000005s)]
*  Syphilis? [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7023.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7024.16s)]
*  Yeah, you can get it, but I think they can cure it. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7025.0s)]
*  They won't kill you. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7026.64s)]
*  No, I think they just give you penicillin, I believe. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7027.4800000000005s)]
*  Do you know that rabies, not to change the subject, [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7030.0s)]
*  it will kill 100% of people that display symptoms? [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7033.04s)]
*  Yeah, it kills everybody. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7035.68s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7036.64s)]
*  Yeah, if you get bit by something with rabies, [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7037.48s)]
*  you have to take painful shots. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7039.12s)]
*  I think they go into your stomach. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7040.8s)]
*  I think it's a large needle that goes into your stomach. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7042.24s)]
*  I think you have to do it multiple times, [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7044.48s)]
*  and I think if you don't do it [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7046.48s)]
*  within a certain period of time, you're done. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7048.28s)]
*  There was a crazy story about the first woman, [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7050.2s)]
*  person who ever survived symptomatic rabies [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7052.64s)]
*  that I heard on, I think, Radiolab, [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7056.6s)]
*  that basically she started displaying all these symptoms, [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7059.2s)]
*  fear of water, rage, all that kind of stuff, [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7063.28s)]
*  and that's fatal 100% of the time. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7065.639999999999s)]
*  But anyway, her parents took her to the doctor, [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7068.04s)]
*  and they go, this really made me laugh. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7071.24s)]
*  It's tragic, but it made me laugh. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7073.919999999999s)]
*  The doctor's like, has anything unusual happened? [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7075.28s)]
*  Anything that you think could have maybe brought this about? [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7077.5199999999995s)]
*  And they're like, no, nothing we can think of. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7081.12s)]
*  Nothing? [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7082.679999999999s)]
*  Not bitten by a dog or a bat? [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7083.5199999999995s)]
*  They go, oh no, yeah, she was bit by a bat. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7085.08s)]
*  Is that what you're talking about? [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7087.12s)]
*  Yeah, she was bit by a bat. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7087.959999999999s)]
*  She was at church and a bat flew under her nose and bit her. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7089.08s)]
*  I was like, yeah, I think that might have been [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7090.84s)]
*  the inflection point. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7092.4400000000005s)]
*  Anyway, they put her into a coma. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7093.6s)]
*  Because something weird about rabies, [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7096.320000000001s)]
*  apparently, like your body, [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7098.28s)]
*  it's kind of what we're talking about with human evolution. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7100.4800000000005s)]
*  Your body can beat it, [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7102.320000000001s)]
*  but I'm not gonna articulate this well. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7104.360000000001s)]
*  Your body moves to beat it, [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7106.4400000000005s)]
*  but it moves at just below the speed of the virus. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7109.08s)]
*  The virus moves faster than your body's ability to beat it. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7113.0s)]
*  If you weren't, if the virus was slower, [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7116.8s)]
*  then your body would cure it, but it goes faster. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7120.320000000001s)]
*  And so they put this girl into an imposed coma [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7124.280000000001s)]
*  and slowed down somehow, in ways I don't understand, [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7127.92s)]
*  slowed down her system in such a way [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7130.280000000001s)]
*  that the rabies went a little bit more dormant [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7133.400000000001s)]
*  and then her body was able to supersede [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7136.64s)]
*  the speed of the virus. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7139.160000000001s)]
*  Did they still do that? [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7140.0s)]
*  They do it regularly now, but it doesn't work. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7141.96s)]
*  It's not like a universal cure, I guess. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7144.96s)]
*  The Milwaukee Protocol recommends [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7147.4s)]
*  inducing therapeutic coma by ketamine and- [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7149.24s)]
*  Back to the rabies scene. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7152.2s)]
*  There it is. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7153.4800000000005s)]
*  Mitrazolem during rabies participants, [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7154.32s)]
*  the first week of ICU admittance. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7156.28s)]
*  So yeah, it's a system now, and it doesn't work well, [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7158.0s)]
*  but it works a lot better than- [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7160.84s)]
*  It's just the ability of the natural host immune response [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7162.16s)]
*  to clear the rabies virus that the patient's supported [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7164.4800000000005s)]
*  through the intense exotoxic phase [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7167.4800000000005s)]
*  is the basic premise of this strategy. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7172.36s)]
*  So that makes sense too, [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7174.44s)]
*  because you'd be able to hydrate them, [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7175.28s)]
*  because one of the things that happens to people, [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7177.2s)]
*  they no longer can drink any water. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7178.639999999999s)]
*  Fear of water, isn't it? [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7180.48s)]
*  They just start throwing it up [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7181.719999999999s)]
*  as soon as it gets in their mouth. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7182.799999999999s)]
*  They said in that podcast that rabies presents [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7183.719999999999s)]
*  in the way that an ancient, [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7189.24s)]
*  by ancient, like million year old disease present, [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7191.919999999999s)]
*  it doesn't feel similar to the more modern diseases [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7195.16s)]
*  and pathology, pathogens that we have in our systems now, [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7198.48s)]
*  but the way it presents is like an ancient killer. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7201.32s)]
*  It's like a ghost of our past. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7205.28s)]
*  It's crazy how common it is in the animal kingdom too. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7206.96s)]
*  And it's really wild that it gets animals to bite you, [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7210.5199999999995s)]
*  to give it to you too. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7214.08s)]
*  That's how it spreads. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7215.08s)]
*  It feels evil, right? [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7215.92s)]
*  It doesn't just feel like a sickness. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7217.04s)]
*  Like a vampire. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7218.96s)]
*  Yeah, all right, that's it. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7219.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, first reported fatality due to rabies [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7221.599999999999s)]
*  in the United States, [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7224.0s)]
*  despite receiving appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis, [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7224.84s)]
*  according to a recent article published [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7228.719999999999s)]
*  in Clinical Infectious, oh, he was 84. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7230.4s)]
*  84 year old man had died in 2021, [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7232.839999999999s)]
*  about six months after waking up in the morning [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7234.92s)]
*  while a rabid bat was biting on his right hand. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7237.759999999999s)]
*  Now this is what we should be afraid of. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7240.4s)]
*  Bats. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7242.0s)]
*  This is the scary thing. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7242.839999999999s)]
*  Think about it, but it is rabies, right? [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7243.679999999999s)]
*  Because it is vampires. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7244.679999999999s)]
*  Because vampire bats. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7246.2s)]
*  I think you're right. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7247.04s)]
*  And they're scared of water. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7247.879999999999s)]
*  It all seems like animals. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7248.7s)]
*  People used to use garlic to keep bats away. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7249.54s)]
*  Is that true? [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7251.719999999999s)]
*  It's not 100% effective, but that's in medieval times. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7252.5599999999995s)]
*  That's really interesting. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7255.92s)]
*  The vampire thing is probably rabies. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7256.759999999999s)]
*  How do we solve this? [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7258.08s)]
*  Bam. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7259.139999999999s)]
*  Dude, rabies, by the way, [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7260.62s)]
*  is like the fact that it killed, [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7263.5s)]
*  that article said it killed the guy who took the appropriate. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7266.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7269.58s)]
*  But he was old. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7270.419999999999s)]
*  If that happened, we're fucked. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7271.24s)]
*  You know what the Tasmanian devil? [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7272.54s)]
*  Mm-hmm, yeah. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7274.339999999999s)]
*  They're all dying of a contagious face cancer. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7275.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's like a VD, right? [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7278.66s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7280.98s)]
*  It's a cancer though. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7281.82s)]
*  Right, it's cancer. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7282.66s)]
*  Imagine cancer goes contagious. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7283.48s)]
*  Right. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7284.9s)]
*  That's the scariest thing I've ever heard in my life. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7285.74s)]
*  The fact that it can exist in one animal [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7287.339999999999s)]
*  means it could exist in all of them. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7289.54s)]
*  Very, very scary. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7291.3s)]
*  What is it from? [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7292.78s)]
*  Tasmanian devils are affected [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7293.86s)]
*  by two independent transmissible cancers [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7295.08s)]
*  known as the devil facial tumor [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7297.22s)]
*  and the devil facial tumor two. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7299.0199999999995s)]
*  Both cancers are spread by biting [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7302.34s)]
*  and cause the appearance of tumors in the face [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7304.46s)]
*  or inside the mouth of affected Tasmanian devils. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7306.5s)]
*  So that's not a sexually transmitted disease. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7308.98s)]
*  No, speaking of a disease feeling mean, [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7310.98s)]
*  like what you were saying with rabies, [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7312.82s)]
*  the reason that, oh, why? [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7313.9s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7315.54s)]
*  The reason that they transmitted so much, [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7316.38s)]
*  they have the cancer in their thing [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7318.02s)]
*  and they've got a behavioral tick [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7319.900000000001s)]
*  where the way that they, I think, fight [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7321.22s)]
*  is to like mash their faces together. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7323.18s)]
*  So they have the confluence of the disease [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7325.38s)]
*  that can spread that way [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7327.860000000001s)]
*  and the behavioral tick that allows it to spread. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7329.38s)]
*  These viruses are just like us. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7332.06s)]
*  They want out. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7333.820000000001s)]
*  They want to live. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7334.780000000001s)]
*  They wanna survive. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7336.06s)]
*  And they will somehow weirdly find a way [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7337.540000000001s)]
*  to spread themselves. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7340.9400000000005s)]
*  So that's why variants are so strange. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7342.5s)]
*  Like the virus will find out [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7345.06s)]
*  that you have some immunity to some certain aspect of it [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7346.7s)]
*  and so they just slightly change [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7351.0199999999995s)]
*  so it sneaks past your immune system. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7352.74s)]
*  I had a weird, very cosmic theory [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7354.42s)]
*  about the pandemic and COVID. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7357.82s)]
*  I know that you don't cotton [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7362.139999999999s)]
*  with conspiracy theories about COVID, but. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7363.7s)]
*  I do. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7365.7s)]
*  No, I'm joking. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7366.54s)]
*  Um, this is more sort of metaphysical though. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7367.38s)]
*  When we were raised, our family, [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7372.86s)]
*  I remember being told to wash my hands all the time. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7376.099999999999s)]
*  But I don't really feel like I told my kids that. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7380.5s)]
*  Like it wasn't like, it used to be almost religious. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7382.74s)]
*  Wash, wash, wash, wash. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7385.139999999999s)]
*  And then by the time I had my kid, [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7386.38s)]
*  I told her to wash her hands, [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7387.9s)]
*  but it wasn't like, you must. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7388.74s)]
*  And then all of a sudden a new pathogen [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7390.98s)]
*  came into the human genome and it was like, [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7393.179999999999s)]
*  obviously I don't think that washing hands [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7395.58s)]
*  is that big of a deal with COVID, [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7397.98s)]
*  but I had this thought, what if viruses go dormant [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7399.219999999999s)]
*  until we kind of, because the reason, [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7403.98s)]
*  this is my big weird theory. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7406.179999999999s)]
*  The reason that we were told wash, wash, wash [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7407.58s)]
*  is residual trauma from Spanish flu. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7410.62s)]
*  This is my theory here. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7413.0599999999995s)]
*  Right? [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7414.339999999999s)]
*  It's like your grandparents lived through that [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7415.179999999999s)]
*  and then they embedded it in your parents, [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7417.179999999999s)]
*  like wash your hands, it's super important. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7419.379999999999s)]
*  And then it got to you. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7421.0199999999995s)]
*  And then it started to fade away a little bit. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7422.139999999999s)]
*  And then all of a sudden you have a new pathogen. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7423.94s)]
*  I was like, what if these viruses have a little, [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7425.299999999999s)]
*  like a weird sort of animal consciousness of like, [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7427.219999999999s)]
*  okay, they've forgotten about the washing hands thing. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7430.86s)]
*  Let's pop up into the human population. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7433.5s)]
*  Anyway, I know it's a little kooky. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7435.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that's it. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7437.18s)]
*  The Spanish flu one's weird, [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7439.860000000001s)]
*  because people didn't really die from the Spanish flu. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7441.3s)]
*  They died of other diseases [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7444.22s)]
*  that they got while they had the Spanish flu. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7446.860000000001s)]
*  Like what did they die of? [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7448.9800000000005s)]
*  They died of meningitis and stuff. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7449.860000000001s)]
*  There was a bunch of different things [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7456.34s)]
*  that people died from. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7458.1s)]
*  All of them would be cured by antibiotics today. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7458.9800000000005s)]
*  Do you know how it got the name Spanish flu? [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7461.98s)]
*  This is an interesting story. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7463.9s)]
*  I do, but I forgot. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7465.099999999999s)]
*  Basically that it wasn't Spanish. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7466.219999999999s)]
*  It was an American thing. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7468.139999999999s)]
*  It started in America, [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7468.98s)]
*  but we were in the midst of World War I. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7470.0199999999995s)]
*  And so every country was in this like media embargo [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7471.62s)]
*  to not say, oh God, there's a new disease in America, [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7474.139999999999s)]
*  because it would have made our army look weak. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7476.82s)]
*  And every other country didn't want to admit it either. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7478.74s)]
*  But Spain was either not involved in the war [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7481.62s)]
*  or didn't have that embargo somehow. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7483.9s)]
*  They reported the disease. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7485.78s)]
*  And so for the rest of the time it's Spanish flu. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7487.259999999999s)]
*  Another weird thing I found out, [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7490.78s)]
*  the flu that you get today is the Spanish flu. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7492.74s)]
*  It's the variant that sprung off from the Spanish flu. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7497.0199999999995s)]
*  Like weakened and weakened and weakened [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7500.7s)]
*  an infinite amount of times. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7502.34s)]
*  But the thing that we get that we call flu [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7503.58s)]
*  is just the cousin of the Spanish flu. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7505.38s)]
*  Wow. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7508.139999999999s)]
*  And the reason why it's weak [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7509.54s)]
*  is because it serves the virus better to not kill you. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7511.46s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7514.62s)]
*  Because it could spread to more people. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7515.46s)]
*  What a weird fucking thing. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7516.54s)]
*  It's wild. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7518.0599999999995s)]
*  It's almost like they, [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7518.9s)]
*  I don't mean literally with my kaka-memi theory [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7519.98s)]
*  that it was consciousness. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7522.5s)]
*  Let's go back, I mean more like that. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7523.7s)]
*  Like that it'll weaken in order to be effective. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7525.5s)]
*  But just the fact that it can do that, [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7528.339999999999s)]
*  that it adjusts and changes. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7530.0599999999995s)]
*  That's what's really scary. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7532.259999999999s)]
*  Like a lot of people are scared of this disease [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7533.82s)]
*  called CWD right now. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7535.419999999999s)]
*  CWD is called chronic wasting disease [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7537.379999999999s)]
*  and it's affected a lot of deer. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7539.459999999999s)]
*  And there's deer all over the country [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7541.66s)]
*  that have this chronic wasting disease [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7543.5s)]
*  and it hasn't jumped to humans. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7545.179999999999s)]
*  I think it has jumped to some mice. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7546.54s)]
*  I think there's in some parts of the country [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7549.1s)]
*  they've tested mice and they tested positive for this stuff. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7551.46s)]
*  But it hasn't jumped, it's a prion disease. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7554.42s)]
*  So it's like mad cow. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7556.58s)]
*  Oh, uh-huh. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7557.9800000000005s)]
*  Jakob Kruetzfeld disease. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7559.860000000001s)]

*  You're fucked. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7564.58s)]
*  And the end is horrific. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7565.42s)]
*  These deer are wandering around just drooling, [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7567.860000000001s)]
*  emaciated, they look like skeletons. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7571.18s)]

*  I don't like this chronic wasting disease. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7575.820000000001s)]
*  Well it's very scary. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7577.46s)]
*  All these things are scary [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7579.58s)]
*  because occasionally they jump. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7580.42s)]
*  Because these things, they can figure out a way to change. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7583.219999999999s)]

*  Especially with large scale agriculture. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7594.94s)]

*  especially industrial agriculture, [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7599.82s)]

*  in all these different parts of the world [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7606.54s)]
*  because people were shitting in the streets [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7608.18s)]

*  And the Younger Dryas Impact Theory [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7975.26s)]
*  is based on a bunch of things, [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7976.62s)]
*  but one of the things it's based on is core samples. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7978.74s)]
*  When they've done these core samples, [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7981.38s)]
*  they show that around 11,800 years ago, [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7982.5s)]
*  without a doubt, the Earth was hit by comets, [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7984.74s)]
*  and they think this is what happened [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7987.78s)]
*  that stopped the Ice Age, [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7990.34s)]
*  this is why the polar ice caps, [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7992.099999999999s)]
*  there used to be ice covering North America, [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7994.78s)]
*  half of North America, [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7997.24s)]
*  be a mile plus sheet of ice. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=7998.139999999999s)]
*  And then it all stopped very quickly, [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8001.139999999999s)]
*  and it also caused the death, [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8003.86s)]
*  the extinction of 65% of the mammals that lived. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8007.3s)]
*  I've heard about that. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8012.5s)]
*  And they think, the people that are proponents [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8013.34s)]
*  of this theory, like Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson, [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8016.14s)]
*  they think that human beings [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8018.54s)]
*  have achieved a very high level of sophistication [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8019.7s)]
*  in probably a different direction than we have now, [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8022.3s)]
*  and that's the pyramids, that's Gobekli Tepe, [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8024.78s)]
*  that's all these ancient structures [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8027.16s)]
*  that they don't understand how people could have explained [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8028.38s)]
*  or built a long, long, long fucking time ago [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8031.02s)]
*  that we can't do now. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8033.860000000001s)]
*  And that's what happened, the impacts happened, [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8035.1s)]
*  and then society rebuilds thousands of years later. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8037.64s)]
*  So thousands of years of barbarism, [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8041.22s)]
*  and then 6,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8043.26s)]
*  written language emerges, agriculture, [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8046.02s)]
*  they start figuring things out again. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8049.06s)]
*  It's like Atlantis. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8051.42s)]
*  Yes, Natasha was into this documentary. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8053.02s)]
*  I remember this now. Ancient Apocalypse. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8055.900000000001s)]
*  That's right. It's on Netflix, it's amazing. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8057.660000000001s)]
*  And it's very likely that that's, [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8059.9400000000005s)]
*  there's physical evidence now. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8062.1s)]
*  It used to be this wacky theory, [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8063.660000000001s)]
*  and people would say, well, [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8065.3s)]
*  there's no evidence of that theory. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8066.14s)]
*  And then they started discovering things [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8067.34s)]
*  like Gobekli Tepe's the best example, [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8069.58s)]
*  that are absolutely, absolutely over 11,000 years old. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8071.38s)]
*  And so they go, okay, 11,000 years ago, [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8076.26s)]
*  people were building these complex stone structures, [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8078.5s)]
*  like how the fuck did they do that [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8081.14s)]
*  when we thought people were hunter-gatherers back then? [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8082.860000000001s)]
*  And then when they find these core samples, [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8085.3s)]
*  there's a high level of iridium in that time period. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8087.34s)]
*  And that's very common in space and very rare on Earth, [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8090.320000000001s)]
*  and it's like a sheet of it. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8092.780000000001s)]
*  Also with a sheet in a lot of these areas, [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8094.18s)]
*  it's just pure carbon, [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8096.42s)]
*  it seems like everything burned. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8098.42s)]
*  And so it's very likely that we were pelted, [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8099.820000000001s)]
*  and it's very likely it's gonna happen again. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8102.620000000001s)]
*  Every June and every November, [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8104.780000000001s)]
*  we pass through this comet storm. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8106.620000000001s)]
*  You always do this to me. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8108.42s)]
*  You're the one that told me about the super volcano. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8109.580000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8111.54s)]
*  And I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8112.38s)]
*  You should think about it. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8113.700000000001s)]
*  Why? What good does it do me? [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8114.54s)]
*  It doesn't do you any good, [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8115.780000000001s)]
*  but it's good to know that every six to 800,000 years, [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8116.860000000001s)]
*  Yellowstone goes. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8120.1s)]
*  Don't re-up this information. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8121.54s)]
*  We go. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8123.18s)]
*  It's a wrap. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8124.02s)]
*  It's a continent killer. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8124.84s)]
*  Oh, I don't want that. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8126.22s)]
*  Wasting disease, I don't want continent killer, [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8128.26s)]
*  and other things I don't want. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8131.06s)]
*  But maybe those are the things that keep us [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8132.86s)]
*  from getting to the place [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8134.86s)]
*  where we nuke each other into oblivion. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8135.78s)]
*  Maybe those are the reset buttons of the universe, [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8137.78s)]
*  where if we go down the bad path, [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8140.18s)]
*  and maybe there's this race to try to be, [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8142.54s)]
*  to have good morals and ethics, [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8146.22s)]
*  and have society evolve at the same level [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8148.02s)]
*  that the human mind and technology evolves, [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8150.7s)]
*  and to overcome this constant need for war, [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8153.22s)]
*  and controlling resources, [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8157.780000000001s)]
*  which have dominated human culture [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8158.620000000001s)]
*  from the beginning of time. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8160.42s)]
*  And that maybe it's this battle, [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8161.54s)]
*  maybe this culture war that we're all fighting [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8164.1s)]
*  that people are complaining about now. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8166.22s)]
*  Maybe part of that is this sort of struggle [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8168.06s)]
*  to achieve a higher level of existence. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8170.620000000001s)]
*  And maybe it's done in the wrong way on both sides, [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8174.54s)]
*  to a certain extent, [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8177.56s)]
*  but ultimately what it is, [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8178.64s)]
*  is trying to sort out what's right, and what's wrong, [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8180.3s)]
*  and what's good, and what's bad, [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8183.1s)]
*  and why certain things take place. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8184.620000000001s)]
*  And if we don't, if we don't get to that, [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8186.42s)]
*  and we keep engaging in wars, [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8189.38s)]
*  then we never reach a technological level of sophistication [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8191.3s)]
*  that allows us to stop natural disasters. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8195.1s)]
*  If we can get to a point [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8198.62s)]
*  where we can knock asteroids out of the sky, [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8199.86s)]
*  and do something to release the pressure [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8202.74s)]
*  of the super volcano, [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8204.78s)]
*  and figure out a way to not have people starve, [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8206.02s)]
*  and all those things could be accomplished [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8209.06s)]
*  if we get to a certain point. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8212.62s)]
*  And I think we're in a race, [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8213.68s)]
*  and I think AI plays a gigantic part of that race. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8215.04s)]
*  I think the race just got really fucking weird. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8218.160000000002s)]
*  That's what I think. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8221.34s)]
*  Yeah, well Neuralink, [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8222.28s)]
*  I mean, the doomsday scenario of AI, [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8223.76s)]
*  and by the way, you're an optimist. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8227.68s)]
*  That's interesting, I didn't know that. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8229.400000000001s)]
*  It seems like you're kind of an optimist. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8230.820000000002s)]
*  I'm optimistic. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8232.36s)]
*  I think human beings generally, [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8233.52s)]
*  society, if it exists long enough, [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8236.240000000002s)]
*  there's always going to be terrible moments, [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8239.2s)]
*  but ultimately, people want the same thing. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8241.24s)]
*  They want their community to be good. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8245.039999999999s)]
*  They want their friends to live. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8247.08s)]
*  They want their families to live. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8248.24s)]
*  You're terrified of other people [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8249.56s)]
*  that might want to take from you [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8251.38s)]
*  the thing that gives you joy, [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8252.72s)]
*  and happiness, and community, and love. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8253.8s)]
*  But ultimately, I think we're going to figure out a way [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8255.96s)]
*  if human beings can exist long enough, [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8259.8s)]
*  where we can work things out [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8261.84s)]
*  much better than we're doing right now. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8262.88s)]
*  I think one of the things that hinders [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8264.56s)]
*  our ability to work things out [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8266.14s)]
*  is just like you were talking about sign language, [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8267.32s)]
*  that your sign from America is different [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8270.560000000001s)]

*  I think if we develop a universal language [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8276.08s)]
*  through translation, through technology, [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8279.0s)]
*  we will eliminate a lot of miscommunication [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8281.04s)]
*  and a lot of this failure to understand each other, [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8284.28s)]
*  because we look at each other as the other. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8288.84s)]

*  So we can sit apart from each other. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8302.56s)]
*  And in real time, this thing could take your, [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8304.48s)]
*  if you're speaking French, [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8307.519999999999s)]
*  you can do it in your ears, in headphones, [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8308.56s)]

*  It does both. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8313.199999999999s)]
*  And if it's in headphones, we both have it. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8314.32s)]
*  I could talk to you in English, [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8316.64s)]

*  The tribal part is that people just adopt ideologies [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8336.12s)]

*  but I also, I love tribes. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8353.84s)]
*  I do love- [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8355.92s)]
*  We're not cool tribes. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8356.76s)]
*  We just need charitable, conscientious tribes [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8358.04s)]
*  that are kind to other people, [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8361.84s)]
*  and just enjoy the differences, [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8364.04s)]
*  instead of thinking the differences [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8366.04s)]
*  as being like some sort of a negative. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8367.4s)]
*  And that's what you're saying, [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8369.16s)]
*  is that hopefully we're evolving towards a situation [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8370.0s)]
*  with a universal language, [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8373.08s)]

*  You can see someone that's different, [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8376.16s)]
*  and think that they're not, [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8377.880000000001s)]
*  what are the differences between isn't that awful [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8379.12s)]
*  to isn't that interesting? [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8381.52s)]
*  Yes, and then because we're in a growth phase, [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8382.56s)]
*  you're gonna go through overcorrections. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8386.36s)]
*  I think a lot of the cultural war that we're involved in, [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8388.480000000001s)]
*  all the craziness that's happening in society, [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8390.800000000001s)]
*  it's an overcorrection, [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8392.960000000001s)]
*  and then people are gonna get fed up with it, [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8394.68s)]
*  and they're gonna move into a more conservative direction, [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8396.640000000001s)]
*  and they'll get fed up with that, [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8399.24s)]
*  and then they'll move to a more liberal direction. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8400.400000000001s)]
*  And it's like, it goes back and forth, [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8401.84s)]
*  because we're trying to figure out [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8404.08s)]
*  what's the right way to do it, [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8405.52s)]
*  and we're basing life on what we were taught by people [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8406.68s)]
*  who didn't know what the fuck they were doing, [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8410.720000000001s)]
*  which is most of our parents and most of their parents. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8412.32s)]
*  They didn't know what the fuck they were doing. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8415.32s)]
*  My grandparents didn't know [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8417.16s)]
*  what the fuck was going on in the world. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8418.24s)]
*  They raised kids who didn't know [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8419.96s)]
*  what the fuck was happening. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8421.24s)]
*  They raised me. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8422.36s)]
*  I barely know what the fuck is going on. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8423.2s)]
*  My kids know more than me. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8424.88s)]
*  Their generation will figure it out a little bit better, [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8426.6s)]
*  and if we can stay alive, [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8428.64s)]
*  we can eventually get to some commonality, [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8430.4s)]
*  and we can realize that a lot of this stupidity [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8432.56s)]
*  is based on our human system of these tribal interactions [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8435.88s)]
*  that's kind of ingrained in our genetics. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8440.8s)]
*  Or we need to make a enemy. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8442.8s)]
*  Maybe that's AI. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8444.08s)]
*  We all come together as a tribe. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8444.92s)]
*  Or UFOs. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8445.76s)]
*  Or UFOs. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8446.6s)]

*  I think they're here already. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8451.24s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8452.52s)]
*  I think they've always been here. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8453.36s)]
*  Why don't they just be like, hey, what's up? [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8454.28s)]
*  I think they're interdimensional, [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8455.12s)]
*  and I think, I've been reading this, [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8456.8s)]
*  I've been reading Diane Pasolka's new book, [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8459.08s)]
*  the other book, the first one. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8461.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's the one I got through. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8462.8s)]
*  Yeah, so this lady who's a religious scholar, [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8464.0s)]
*  I'm reading American Cosmic now. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8466.72s)]
*  We gotta get you out of here. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8468.76s)]
*  Oh, sorry, yeah. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8469.64s)]
*  I have a book event tonight. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8470.68s)]
*  I know you do. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8471.64s)]
*  Tonight's the night. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8472.48s)]
*  With Duncan. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8473.56s)]
*  With Duncan, tonight. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8474.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8475.24s)]
*  I'm super excited. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8476.08s)]
*  But I could fucking talk to you all night. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8476.92s)]
*  Yeah, we'll wrap this up, [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8479.039999999999s)]
*  but I'll recommend this book to people. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8480.039999999999s)]
*  It's called American Cosmic, [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8481.16s)]
*  and it's essentially about this whole flying saucer. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8482.439999999999s)]
*  I just did a whole podcast with the woman. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8487.8s)]
*  But now this is a previous book that I'm reading, [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8489.84s)]
*  and it connects it to religion, [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8492.56s)]
*  and it connects it to the stories in the Bible of Ezekiel, [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8494.8s)]
*  that Ezekiel is essentially seeing a UFO, [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8497.64s)]
*  and that these things are not just a physical thing, [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8500.4s)]
*  there's some sort of a psychological aspect to them. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8504.039999999999s)]
*  There's some sort of a frequency [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8507.52s)]
*  that we connect to occasionally as human beings, [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8509.06s)]
*  as thinking creatures. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8512.0s)]
*  You're saying we get to a state of kind of enlightenment [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8513.32s)]
*  where the dimensional portal opens up for a split second, [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8517.02s)]
*  and that's what we see. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8519.96s)]
*  I don't know if you would call it enlightenment. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8521.36s)]
*  Or frenzy, spiritual frenzy? [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8524.039999999999s)]
*  A state of being able to receive [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8525.72s)]
*  whatever the frequency these things operate on. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8528.96s)]
*  And I think it's based on, [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8532.08s)]
*  I think there's a lot of stories from ancient religion [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8535.9s)]
*  that's probably based on this. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8538.52s)]
*  And I think as we get more and more of an understanding [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8539.96s)]
*  of quantum physics and this concept of dimensions, [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8544.08s)]
*  and this concept of the ability of something [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8547.86s)]
*  that's far more advanced than us to manipulate dimensions [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8551.68s)]
*  and to visit back and forth, [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8554.4s)]
*  and that the potential is that maybe that is [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8556.16s)]
*  where all intelligent life forms eventually evolve to [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8558.92s)]
*  if given enough time and they do it correctly. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8562.8s)]
*  They become interdimensional travelers. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8564.88s)]
*  And that what we're looking at, [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8567.599999999999s)]
*  when we're looking at these grays, [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8569.08s)]
*  these weird looking things, that's us in the future. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8571.039999999999s)]
*  Coming back to visit. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8573.72s)]
*  Yeah, interdimensionally. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8574.779999999999s)]
*  That this is our path. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8576.64s)]
*  That we'll become these genderless things, [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8578.439999999999s)]
*  the giant heads that use telepathy. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8580.56s)]
*  Well, just like this Elon Musk invention, [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8583.64s)]
*  this neural link that's gonna allow you to scroll. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8586.48s)]
*  And so paralyzed people can use the internet. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8589.16s)]
*  It's going to be able to operate machinery. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8591.24s)]
*  One of the things that Bob Lazar said [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8593.08s)]
*  about that craft right there, the sport model, [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8594.84s)]
*  that he allegedly worked on in Area 51, Site 4, [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8597.0s)]
*  was that they didn't have controls in them. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8601.28s)]
*  They operated them with their minds. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8603.880000000001s)]
*  And it's so funny because when he first said that, [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8606.42s)]
*  it probably sounded, I mean, [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8609.36s)]
*  it still sounds a little bit like bullshit. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8610.84s)]
*  But it probably sounds crazy. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8612.32s)]
*  But when you look at neural link, you go, wait a minute. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8613.960000000001s)]
*  I guess I could see operating a craft with my mind [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8617.24s)]
*  in a thousand years from now. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8620.56s)]
*  There's that idea that AI, when robotics catches up to AI, [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8622.34s)]
*  and AI can implant itself in a robot warrior, [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8626.36s)]
*  then they are like an entity. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8629.4s)]
*  And then they look and they go, [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8631.6s)]
*  what is the only threat to us? [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8632.6s)]
*  Oh, it's humans. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8633.92s)]
*  Terminator. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8635.24s)]
*  Let us get rid of the Terminator. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8636.08s)]
*  So that makes it so that our only hope is neural link. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8637.64s)]
*  Hopefully we can fuse and the AI will not say [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8642.24s)]
*  what's our threat? [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8646.24s)]
*  They go, oh no, that's us. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8647.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we will emerge. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8648.4s)]
*  That's our meet us. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8649.24s)]
*  I think that's what's gonna happen no matter what. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8650.08s)]
*  Because I think once it happens, [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8652.64s)]
*  the people that have it will have such a massive advantage [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8654.119999999999s)]
*  over everyone else that has to use a device. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8656.64s)]
*  It's like steroids. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8659.68s)]
*  Yeah, well it's not just like that. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8660.64s)]
*  It's like having a car, living in a house, [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8661.92s)]
*  having a television, having the internet. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8664.64s)]
*  If you live in the woods by yourself with no language, [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8666.4s)]
*  you're fucked, right? [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8668.68s)]
*  It's like the tribe coming out of the jungle [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8669.6s)]
*  and saying I want some clothes. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8671.24s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8672.32s)]
*  But on a mega, mega level. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8673.16s)]
*  On a mega, mega level. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8674.24s)]
*  I think that's where we're going. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8675.12s)]
*  I think that's what the UFOs are. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8676.880000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean do you think that in this universe [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8678.84s)]
*  my book is a best seller? [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8682.04s)]
*  I think it's gonna be fucking huge. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8683.04s)]
*  Thank goodness. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8684.76s)]
*  Now this is what's important. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8685.6s)]
*  There it is right there. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8687.08s)]
*  Subculture of Vulture, a memoir in six scenes [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8687.92s)]
*  by Moshe Kasher, available now. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8691.2s)]
*  Did you do the audio book? [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8693.560000000001s)]
*  I did do the audio book, yeah. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8694.76s)]
*  Yes. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8696.08s)]
*  Thank God you let an actor do it. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8696.92s)]
*  No, never. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8698.08s)]
*  Although what's really funny is there's a part. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8698.92s)]
*  Did they try to pressure you to do it? [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8700.160000000002s)]
*  No, no, no, they wanted me to do it. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8701.400000000001s)]
*  I think they like when comics do it. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8702.640000000001s)]
*  But there's a funny part in there where my friend Larry, [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8703.8s)]
*  early in my life, throws me up against a wall [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8707.359999999999s)]
*  at an AA meeting and tells me to stop saying the N word. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8709.88s)]
*  And he's black kid, a black friend of mine. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8712.359999999999s)]
*  And it was like when I was like, [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8714.519999999999s)]
*  thought that I had a pass or whatever. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8716.16s)]
*  And it's a moment about like, you know, [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8718.279999999999s)]
*  popping your head out of your ass basically. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8721.8s)]
*  Like he basically threw me up against a wall [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8723.359999999999s)]
*  and like shifted my perspective into like, [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8724.759999999998s)]
*  of course that's not what I'm supposed to be doing. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8726.679999999998s)]
*  But I had this passage in the book where I was like, [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8729.08s)]
*  I mean it's a very short passage, but I'm like, [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8732.039999999999s)]
*  I'm not reading that shit. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8733.56s)]
*  And so I went forensically into my past [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8734.8s)]
*  and contacted Larry and said, Larry, [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8738.56s)]
*  it would be awesome if you would read the part of Larry. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8741.4s)]
*  And I found him and he did it. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8744.88s)]
*  That's amazing. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8746.359999999999s)]
*  So it's me and Larry. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8747.199999999999s)]
*  That's great. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8748.019999999999s)]
*  That's awesome. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8748.88s)]
*  It's out now. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8749.72s)]
*  I'm gonna see you tonight. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4pTEXSZE-E&t=8751.64s)]
