*  Good to see you, brother. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=14.0s)]
*  Good to be back. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=15.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=16.0s)]
*  I miss you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=17.0s)]
*  I miss you too. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=18.0s)]
*  I used to get to see you every week. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=19.0s)]
*  I thought about that the other day. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=20.0s)]
*  Like, yeah. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=21.0s)]
*  You forget that that's like a period of time and it's not going to be forever sometimes, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=22.0s)]
*  you know? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=25.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=26.0s)]
*  Well, it almost was. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=27.0s)]
*  You were the first people to take the trip out here. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=28.0s)]
*  I was. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=30.0s)]
*  It was clear as day when I first came out. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=31.0s)]
*  I'm like, why wouldn't you be out here? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=32.0s)]
*  Because I remember I had this writing job, right? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=34.0s)]
*  And so I was just like on Zoom every day. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=36.0s)]
*  And life kind of sucked because you couldn't go out. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=39.0s)]
*  So I was just trapped in my house. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=41.0s)]
*  And then in between a lunch break, I'm on Instagram and I see Tony, you know, Tony Hinchcliffe's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=43.0s)]
*  post. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=48.0s)]
*  This is like in the infancy of him coming out here, you know? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=49.0s)]
*  He's like, sold out, Anton's. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=51.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=53.0s)]
*  It seemed like this bizarro universe where like life is still happening. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=54.0s)]
*  And I love stand up so much. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=58.0s)]
*  And I was just kind of miserable. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=60.0s)]
*  And I'm like, if this is happening out there, I can do stand up. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=61.0s)]
*  So then I started asking questions. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=65.0s)]
*  I hit up the EPs. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=68.0s)]
*  I'm like, yo, because we're on Zoom, could I could I just write from Austin? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=69.0s)]
*  Zoom by day and then do stand up out here with like all you guys at night. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=73.0s)]
*  And they're like, we don't see why not. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=77.0s)]
*  So it's awesome. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=79.0s)]
*  I got an apartment out here. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=80.0s)]
*  I would zoom by day. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=81.0s)]
*  I would just be doing awesome shows at Vulcan and stuff at night. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=82.0s)]
*  It was it felt like a life hack. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=85.0s)]
*  It was a life hack. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=87.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was great. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=88.0s)]
*  I'm so glad I did that. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=89.0s)]
*  Have you been to the mothership yet? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=90.0s)]
*  Of course, dude. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=92.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's amazing. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=93.0s)]
*  I got to do I think you're on vacation. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=94.0s)]
*  Then Adam had me do where you normally do in the middle of the week. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=97.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=99.0s)]
*  The Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=100.0s)]
*  So I got to do like six shows in that beautiful big room. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=102.0s)]
*  Both rooms are great. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=107.0s)]
*  You know, I like that small one for a six or seven people. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=108.0s)]
*  I like that one for working on stuff. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=111.0s)]
*  It's kind of like the belly. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=113.0s)]
*  It's very much like the small rooms, the combination of the belly and the or. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=114.0s)]
*  It's a little bit bigger than the belly room and a little more locked in. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=118.0s)]
*  Yeah, the belly room. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=123.0s)]
*  And then the big room is like combination of the or the main room. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=124.0s)]
*  That's what I tell everybody because they go, what's it like? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=127.0s)]
*  And it is it's like if those rooms had babies like they're in the middle of both of all three of those rooms. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=129.0s)]
*  They're both perfect. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=135.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're the perfect size. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=136.0s)]
*  You know, it's kind of funny. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=138.0s)]
*  I think the store has started to like get a facelift because of what you've done at Mothership, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=139.0s)]
*  because so many comics would come back and be like, you know, they just give you all your sets. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=144.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=148.0s)]
*  The sounds amazing. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=149.0s)]
*  Like because it's so state of the art. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=151.0s)]
*  Well, there's also the screens in the green room that show you what's going on on stage and the time. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=152.0s)]
*  You can't miss your spot. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=156.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can't miss your spot. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=157.0s)]
*  And there's lights everywhere. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=159.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=160.0s)]
*  So let you know there's lights and there's two sets of lights in the hallway, one in the beginning of the hallway, one of the top of the stairs. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=161.0s)]
*  You always know when the guys got the light. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=166.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=168.0s)]
*  So I think if you have any suggestions, by the way, just throw them out. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=169.0s)]
*  We'll use them. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=173.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=174.0s)]
*  Half of the club is built on suggestions. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=175.0s)]
*  Well, you can tell, you know, like this. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=177.0s)]
*  I think it was Tony's idea to have the lights in the green room. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=180.0s)]
*  It might have been Tony's idea also to have the monitors in the green room. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=183.0s)]
*  It was Louis's idea to lower the ceiling. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=186.0s)]
*  It was Louis's idea to change the size of the stage in the little room and lower the ceiling in the little room. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=188.0s)]
*  How big was the stage before Louis suggested the change? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=194.0s)]
*  It was like four feet more on each side. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=197.0s)]
*  Too big? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=199.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was too big. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=200.0s)]
*  It was too big. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=201.0s)]
*  He was right. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=202.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=203.0s)]
*  He's like, why do you have all this extra stage? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=204.0s)]
*  You don't really see the intimate room. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=205.0s)]
*  Like, yeah, you're right. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=206.0s)]
*  But it was just, you know, we just kind of like walked into this empty space when it was just a movie theater. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=207.0s)]
*  So when it was a movie theater, it was we had to change everything. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=213.0s)]
*  Right. So we changed the way the stairs are. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=217.0s)]
*  So in a movie theater, the stairs slant way down at a steep angle. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=219.0s)]
*  Right. So you could all watch the big screen. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=222.0s)]
*  We raised the floor up. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=224.0s)]
*  So we had to build a concrete like a rebar and concrete floor. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=226.0s)]
*  So it's a totally different floor. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=231.0s)]
*  Yes. It's crazy. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=233.0s)]
*  So we raised it up. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=234.0s)]
*  And then Louis wanted me to lower the ceiling even more. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=235.0s)]
*  So I did that as well. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=238.0s)]
*  After the fact when it was all said and done? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=239.0s)]
*  No, it wasn't all said and done. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=240.0s)]
*  We were in the middle of everything. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=241.0s)]
*  Luckily, we did have to recut the stage in the small room because we it was the but the concrete hadn't been poured yet. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=242.0s)]
*  So they just had to recut the steel and put it on. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=250.0s)]
*  But it's very interesting. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=252.0s)]
*  It's very interesting. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=254.0s)]
*  I've never been a part of building anything like that before. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=255.0s)]
*  Yeah. You could tell though, because you're a stand up of several years, you could tell it was designed by a comedian. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=257.0s)]
*  It's all done with comics. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=264.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=265.0s)]
*  Comics input and also Richard the architect, who is amazing. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=266.0s)]
*  Shout out to Richard Wies. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=269.0s)]
*  He's the man. He's the man. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=271.0s)]
*  He's so good. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=273.0s)]
*  I'll have him on the podcast someday. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=274.0s)]
*  He's a really interesting guy. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=275.0s)]
*  And he he also came up with the idea of making the tunnel. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=276.0s)]
*  Oh, the tunnel. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=280.0s)]
*  The tunnel is the shit. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=281.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's such a cool hangout. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=282.0s)]
*  The whole thing is just such it's all just set up just for a hang. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=284.0s)]
*  Uh huh. You know, everybody feels good. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=287.0s)]
*  The most valuable asset to comedians, especially nowadays, is getting that footage, dude. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=289.0s)]
*  The footage is big. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=293.0s)]
*  It's a film you. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=294.0s)]
*  And then also it's like really high quality. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=295.0s)]
*  Yes. It's eight K. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=298.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=299.0s)]
*  The sounds great. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=300.0s)]
*  So I've been pushing for that at the store and I think they're starting to. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=301.0s)]
*  It's just it's just a process. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=304.0s)]
*  But you also have to put people's phones in bags so they pay attention. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=305.0s)]
*  People are so goddamn distracted, me included. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=309.0s)]
*  It's so hard to sit there. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=311.0s)]
*  It's one of the things that I love about podcasts is for three hours, I'm not going to see what's going on in the world. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=313.0s)]
*  And I'm locked in. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=318.0s)]

*  Just come into the woods and pose for me. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=619.64s)]
*  So he turned his truck into a camera. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=621.44s)]
*  He built his own camera. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=623.44s)]
*  And the whole thing is like the dark room, you know, everything. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=624.96s)]
*  And then he does the chemical process. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=628.7199999999999s)]
*  It makes really cool photos on metal. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=630.1999999999999s)]
*  He's printing them right to metal. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=632.64s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=634.24s)]
*  That is kind of the most of the photos we have is like a transfer to metal. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=635.24s)]
*  These are directly to metal. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=637.48s)]
*  Is that how they first started making photos? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=638.56s)]
*  Did they put them on metal? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=640.4s)]
*  I don't think it was metal. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=641.4s)]
*  Well, plates. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=642.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think it would be plates. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=643.4s)]
*  He's returning to nature. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=644.4s)]
*  Oh, that one didn't work. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=645.4s)]
*  So he's just throwing it. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=646.4s)]
*  Hey, dude, don't litter. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=647.8s)]
*  Come on. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=649.6s)]
*  I know you're mad that your fucking homemade camera doesn't work, but you better pick that [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=651.6s)]
*  up, bitch. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=655.68s)]
*  That's the beauty of YouTube. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=656.68s)]
*  I don't think I just littered. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=658.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=659.1999999999999s)]
*  You think that's not natural? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=660.1999999999999s)]
*  You can't litter in those places, bro. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=661.1999999999999s)]
*  There's too many people visit. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=662.52s)]
*  Think about how many people visit national parks. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=664.0s)]
*  It looks so important not litter. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=666.3199999999999s)]
*  No one's going in there cleaning up after you fucking animals. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=668.7199999999999s)]
*  Don't do it. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=672.12s)]
*  Don't litter. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=673.12s)]
*  And you're in the woods, man. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=674.12s)]
*  My friend, Adam Green Tree, he goes on these big backpacking hunts where he'll go into [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=675.12s)]
*  the Montana mountains, Colorado mountains for like a month at a time. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=679.3599999999999s)]
*  And he's just picking up bags of people's shit that they left behind, bags of empty [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=683.68s)]
*  water bottles, bags of trash. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=689.1999999999999s)]
*  And he just brings a bag with him and he collects it while he's out there hunting. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=692.62s)]
*  He said, it's disgusting. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=696.2399999999999s)]
*  Nice of him to do. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=697.2399999999999s)]
*  I'm sure there's tons of stuff out there. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=698.2399999999999s)]
*  So disturbing, though, that people do that. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=699.64s)]
*  It's the worst aspect of us, this just total willingness through completely being selfish [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=703.7199999999999s)]
*  of just destroying one of the most amazing things we have in this country, which is national [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=712.0400000000001s)]
*  parks and public lands and place where you could just walk out into the woods. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=718.44s)]
*  There's tons of places in this country where you can just go on a hike in the fucking woods [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=723.72s)]
*  with bears and moose and all kinds of shit. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=729.6800000000001s)]
*  You can just go out there, man. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=732.6800000000001s)]
*  Hopefully you know what you're doing, but nobody really tests you. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=734.64s)]
*  Nobody says, hey, Fahim, how long can you hike before you die? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=737.5600000000001s)]
*  Let's find out. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=742.8s)]
*  Hey, Fahim, do you do any cardio at all? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=743.8s)]
*  Hey, Fahim, do you know how to use a compass? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=745.08s)]
*  Hey, Fahim, do you guys have fucking something to start fire with? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=747.16s)]
*  Well, that's when you make the local news and then a file photo of me and like the search [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=750.72s)]
*  has been on for six days. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=754.48s)]
*  Bro, it's so hard to stay alive. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=755.8s)]
*  It's so hard. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=758.04s)]
*  Yeah, I've never like stayed alive. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=759.04s)]
*  You know, I'm obviously just talking out of my ass, but I have been camping. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=761.16s)]
*  And one of the things that you realize when you go camping, if you just go camping just [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=766.44s)]
*  a few nights in a row, you realize like what fucking bitches people are. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=770.4399999999999s)]
*  These animals, they sleep on the ground every night. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=774.92s)]
*  They don't give a fuck. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=777.4399999999999s)]
*  They're out there wild. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=779.12s)]
*  There's no doors. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=780.76s)]
*  There's no borders. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=781.76s)]
*  And they have all these defense mechanisms they developed to protect them from predators [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=782.76s)]
*  because of that, because there's no hiding. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=786.68s)]
*  Every day is war. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=790.0s)]
*  If you're a fucking deer, every day is like listening for branches snapping. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=791.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's just life. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=796.4s)]
*  Every day. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=797.84s)]
*  I was snorkeling in Hawaii and you get to see all that marine life down there. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=799.2800000000001s)]
*  And I just saw the sea turtle so peaceful. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=803.2800000000001s)]
*  And then part of me was like, he doesn't have to worry about rent or anything. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=805.72s)]
*  He doesn't have to make money to exist, which was like an interesting concept. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=809.2s)]
*  But he has so many other problems too. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=812.9200000000001s)]
*  He's got problems. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=814.6800000000001s)]
*  He's got problems. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=815.6800000000001s)]
*  But there's just something about like that being enough for this turtle just kind of [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=816.6800000000001s)]
*  floating whereas like I got to get a job. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=820.0s)]
*  I got to go on tour. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=822.1600000000001s)]
*  I got to make money. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=823.1600000000001s)]
*  I have to have an apartment. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=824.1600000000001s)]
*  I have to, you know what I mean? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=825.1600000000001s)]
*  What do you think humans need to do to exist? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=826.48s)]
*  The turtles are residual effect of evolution that's no longer necessary. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=829.0s)]
*  But we think they're beautiful. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=833.04s)]
*  I think they're beautiful, man. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=834.24s)]
*  We think they're cool. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=835.24s)]
*  Cool guys. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=836.24s)]
*  They live a long time. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=837.24s)]
*  When you see a turtle, you're like, hey bro, this design is not going to survive. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=838.24s)]
*  Man, I can watch a turtle eat lettuce forever. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=841.12s)]
*  Doesn't Stallone still have his turtle from Rocky? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=843.7199999999999s)]
*  Whoa, is it that old? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=845.8s)]
*  It's old, man. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=847.48s)]
*  They live a long time. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=848.48s)]
*  I had turtles. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=849.6s)]
*  I had to get rid of them when I had babies because turtles are dirty little creatures. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=850.6s)]
*  You don't want to have that stuff around. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=855.4399999999999s)]
*  But they were ruthless. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=856.68s)]
*  I would slowly root them. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=859.92s)]
*  No, I would feed them goldfish. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=861.52s)]
*  Dude, I had piranhas at one point in time. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=863.3599999999999s)]
*  Of course you did. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=866.68s)]
*  That's like the most Joe Rogan pet. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=867.68s)]
*  And they were not nearly as ruthless as these fucking turtles. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=868.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=872.8s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=873.8s)]
*  Rocky, you still got the same turtle. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=874.8s)]
*  44 years old. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=876.8399999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=877.8399999999999s)]
*  This was five years ago. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=878.8399999999999s)]
*  The turtle looks great. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=879.8399999999999s)]
*  He looks 10. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=880.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm sure they're not dead yet. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=881.8399999999999s)]
*  I bet they do because tortoises live like a thousand years, don't they? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=883.88s)]
*  Something a long time. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=887.6s)]
*  I think sea turtles live a long fucking time too, which is like the saddest thing. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=888.6s)]
*  We just think people kill them and eat them. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=891.88s)]
*  You're like, oh. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=893.44s)]
*  But how good must they be though? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=894.44s)]
*  How tasty if they're doing that? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=896.36s)]
*  You think so? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=897.72s)]
*  Sometimes I think of like shark fin soup. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=898.72s)]
*  You're like, how good must it be? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=900.8000000000001s)]
*  Aquatic turtles will commonly live 20 to 30 years in captivity, but many can live much [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=903.1600000000001s)]
*  longer. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=908.52s)]
*  Tortoises are some estimated live 100 to 150 years. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=910.68s)]
*  So it's not tortoises. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=915.08s)]
*  Is it sea turtles that live forever? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=916.08s)]
*  Who are the old ones? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=918.12s)]
*  So some of them can live up to 250 years. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=920.4399999999999s)]
*  What about sea turtles? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=924.04s)]
*  Maybe it's sea turtles. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=925.52s)]
*  Do you think there's like a family that has a turtle that's been in the family for generations? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=926.52s)]

*  That's a solid question. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=936.56s)]
*  That'd be awesome. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=937.56s)]
*  I think there's sharks that are alive today that are the oldest living creatures. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=939.04s)]
*  I think there's sharks. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=945.0s)]

*  Wrap your head around that. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=981.6s)]
*  You're a baby turtle. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=983.16s)]
*  You're just fucking chilling. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=984.76s)]
*  All of a sudden these boats pull up. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=985.76s)]
*  This isn't going to be anything. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=987.76s)]
*  Do you think some of these turtles are not that progressive because they're pretty old [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=988.96s)]
*  and they haven't been... [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=992.36s)]
*  They're probably super conservative. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=993.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=994.36s)]
*  They probably watch Fox News. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=995.36s)]
*  They're like women are wearing pants? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=996.36s)]
*  What is this? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=997.36s)]

*  I think maybe that's what they call it. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1017.84s)]
*  Alligator snapping turtle. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1019.4s)]

*  Look at the size of that one. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1037.6000000000001s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1038.6000000000001s)]
*  Like that guy has. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1039.6000000000001s)]

*  If that maw gets a hold of one of those fingers, that shit is so gone. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1042.52s)]
*  You're trusting your grip. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1047.8400000000001s)]

*  That is a monster. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1056.16s)]
*  If that was big and storming into a village in Mongolia a thousand years ago in some crazy [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1057.16s)]
*  movie, you'd be like, oh my God, you have some Lord of the Rings type movie? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1063.8s)]
*  That would exactly be what it would look like. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1067.96s)]

*  Oh yeah, yeah. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1073.56s)]
*  Right? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1074.56s)]
*  That's like those scenes in the movies where the heroes are against the wall, but then [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1075.56s)]
*  the people riding these things come in from the side. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1079.1399999999999s)]
*  You go, yeah, bro, we are so weak. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1081.24s)]
*  What, just humans in general? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1084.0s)]
*  Humans. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1085.0s)]
*  We're so weak. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1086.0s)]
*  What an amazing trade-off, though. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1087.0s)]
*  But we have bombs. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1088.32s)]
*  Yeah, we have guns, we have everything. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1089.32s)]
*  We have houses, we have cars, we have so many different things. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1091.28s)]
*  We way made up for it. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1095.0s)]
*  But isn't it interesting that as you make up for it, you have to give away your physical [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1096.52s)]
*  defenses. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1102.92s)]
*  We're the most vulnerable. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1103.92s)]
*  A good house cat could fuck you up. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1106.24s)]
*  A house cat could fuck you up, dude. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1108.4s)]
*  A rat for sure. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1111.32s)]

*  You'd be so scared of that. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1115.24s)]
*  Yeah, I saw this video, you know, you see videos on Twitter and stuff. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1116.24s)]
*  This guy in New York, there's a possum just on the side of this building. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1119.08s)]
*  And then this white guy helps the neighborhood out, he just grabs it off the wall and it's [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1123.48s)]
*  like, and everyone's just thanking this guy and he just knows how to handle the possum. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1127.9599999999998s)]
*  And he walks it down the street and he just like throws it into an alley. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1132.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, my dog Marshall likes possums. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1136.6s)]
*  That's the person who grew up on a farm. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1139.1999999999998s)]
*  That lady just grabs it. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1140.9199999999998s)]
*  This is a sub genre on the internet. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1142.24s)]
*  That lady just grabbed that thing like she knew exactly what the fuck she was doing. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1143.96s)]

*  Like does she have experience? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1152.96s)]
*  I wouldn't. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1153.96s)]
*  She must. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1154.96s)]
*  She must. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1155.96s)]
*  Unless it's hers. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1156.96s)]

*  Roscoe. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1168.4s)]
*  They have a disease, a very specific disease, right? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1169.88s)]
*  Don't possums have like something nasty? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1172.76s)]
*  I think they have something nasty. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1177.0800000000002s)]
*  I was worried because my dogs got them a couple of times. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1178.0800000000002s)]
*  They just lock up. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1181.0400000000002s)]
*  They don't even fight back. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1182.0400000000002s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1189.0400000000002s)]
*  It's a weird response. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1190.0400000000002s)]
*  So me and the possums have the same technique. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1191.0400000000002s)]
*  They don't know if it's a response to escape coyotes because coyotes sometimes will kill [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1192.0400000000002s)]
*  you and not eat you immediately. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1197.3200000000002s)]

*  She got a... [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1210.2s)]
*  Toxoplasmosis. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1211.2s)]
*  Parasite, toxo, and then something called leptos. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1212.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1215.2s)]
*  All kinds of bad shit. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1216.2s)]

*  You went to college. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1225.2s)]
*  I mean, I didn't study this. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1226.2s)]
*  I didn't study possums. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1227.2s)]
*  How do you say that? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1228.44s)]
*  Coccidiosis. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1229.44s)]
*  Coccidiosis. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1230.44s)]
*  A microscopic parasite found in a possum feces spreads a disease known as coccydiosis. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1231.44s)]
*  When a possums are immune to this disease, they're carriers and spread it to other animals. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1239.8400000000001s)]

*  Oh, shit. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1254.76s)]
*  This one sounds tough. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1255.76s)]
*  Death by parasites. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1256.76s)]
*  You know what they give you when you have parasites? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1258.32s)]
*  What? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1259.32s)]
*  Iveractin. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1260.32s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1261.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1262.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it's originally for. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1263.32s)]
*  This is... [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1264.32s)]
*  Dogs are susceptible to this one. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1265.32s)]
*  Dogs are susceptible to leptospirosis. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1266.32s)]
*  Bacterial infection through contact with a possum, urine, or contaminated water. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1273.32s)]
*  Both pets and humans can... [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1277.8799999999999s)]
*  I wonder if that means if they bite them. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1279.36s)]
*  If they bite them, they definitely can get toxo if they eat them. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1281.6s)]
*  So the moral of the story is just stay away from possums if you can, right? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1284.76s)]
*  I would imagine. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1287.4799999999998s)]
*  Toxo is the wildest. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1288.4799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1289.4799999999998s)]
*  Do you know that they think that somewhere in some places like at France at one point [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1290.4799999999998s)]
*  in time, 50% of the population was positive for toxo? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1294.9599999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1298.6s)]
*  Why? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1299.6s)]
*  From what? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1300.6s)]
*  Cats. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1301.6s)]
*  From feral cats. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1302.6s)]
*  Feral cats leave cat shit around, and that's why they tell pregnant women never touch cat [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1303.6s)]
*  litter. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1307.6399999999999s)]
*  It's really bad for the kid if the woman's pregnant and she gets toxo. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1308.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1312.52s)]
*  But it's a parasite that infects your brain. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1313.6s)]
*  The wildest thing about it is what it does to rats, because it rewires the rat's sexual [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1316.92s)]
*  reward system, this parasite does, and gets the rat horny for cat piss. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1321.96s)]
*  So the cat is pissing somewhere. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1327.2s)]
*  The rat finds where the cat's pissing, and he's literally erect. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1329.76s)]
*  Is he just fucking a liquid or what? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1332.56s)]
*  He has no fear of cats. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1334.72s)]
*  Zero fear of cats. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1336.6399999999999s)]
*  Their fear of cats completely goes away to the point where they pursue cats. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1337.6399999999999s)]
*  So the cats eat the rats, because toxo can only grow and can only reproduce inside the [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1341.36s)]
*  cat's digestive tract. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1347.1999999999998s)]
*  So inside the cat's gut, it's reproducing. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1349.9599999999998s)]
*  The cat shits it out, and then the cycle repeats itself. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1352.6s)]
*  The rats eat it, the rats eat the cat shit, rats always eat shit. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1356.0s)]
*  They get toxo, they give it to other cats. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1360.4399999999998s)]
*  Vicious cycle. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1363.4799999999998s)]
*  And it gets to people, and it makes people reckless. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1364.8799999999999s)]
*  Is a disproportionate amount of high instances of toxo are connected to successful soccer [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1368.24s)]
*  teams? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1373.56s)]
*  How do you know so much about toxo? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1374.56s)]
*  I'm fascinated by it. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1376.04s)]
*  There's this guy, Robert Sapolsky, out of Stanford? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1377.04s)]
*  Is he out of Stanford? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1379.8s)]
*  Yeah, I believe so. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1381.8400000000001s)]
*  Brilliant guy. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1383.56s)]
*  But he did all this work on toxoplasmosis. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1384.72s)]
*  One of the things they found when he was a resident, or maybe it was one of his friends [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1387.76s)]
*  that was a resident, they found that there was a disproportionate amount of motorcycle [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1391.16s)]
*  victims who tested positive for toxo. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1395.88s)]
*  So they started testing motorcycle victims for toxo, and they found that there was a [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1398.48s)]
*  disproportionate amount. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1401.68s)]
*  Enough to indicate that there's probably something going on there, that maybe the toxo makes [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1403.6000000000001s)]
*  people more reckless. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1407.68s)]
*  That's so weird how that can make you do that. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1409.8400000000001s)]
*  It's nuts, dude. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1412.3200000000002s)]
*  You think of how many people have feral cats, how many people probably have it. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1413.3200000000002s)]
*  You can have it and not even have any idea, have no inclination that you have it. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1416.3600000000001s)]

*  X has porn on it, which is so wild that during the time where they were trying to take people... [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1504.76s)]
*  Take their accounts away for COVID information that they didn't think was correct at the [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1510.1200000000001s)]
*  time, they were allowing hardcore porn. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1514.88s)]
*  I know. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1517.72s)]
*  You forget it's the Wild Wild West on there. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1518.72s)]
*  And I'm not saying they shouldn't. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1520.04s)]
*  Sure. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1521.04s)]
*  I'd love that it's the Wild Wild West. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1522.04s)]
*  But it's such whiplash. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1523.04s)]
*  I'll be watching a cat video and then there's just some guy getting hit by a car. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1524.04s)]
*  I'm like, Jesus. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1529.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1530.72s)]
*  Give me a minute. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1531.72s)]
*  Let me brace myself. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1532.72s)]
*  Instagram knows that I watched those motherfuckers. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1533.72s)]
*  It's just serving you up. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1535.72s)]
*  It knows your alibis. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1536.72s)]
*  It's just serving me up. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1537.72s)]
*  I'm not even following these accounts. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1539.48s)]
*  You like this guy dying. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1541.1200000000001s)]
*  You may like this guy. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1542.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1543.2s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1544.2s)]
*  Should your feed be only people you follow or should they show you a bunch of shit? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1545.2s)]
*  Well, that's what these companies are struggling with because when it was all just your circle, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1549.3600000000001s)]
*  people weren't consuming as much as the suggested videos. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1553.92s)]
*  You know, what's funny is I got shadow banned on Instagram around Thanksgiving. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1556.56s)]
*  What did you do? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1562.24s)]
*  Hardly anything. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1563.3600000000001s)]
*  It sucks because I'm trying to do a special via non-traditional means, you know? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1565.0s)]
*  It's not Netflix. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1569.28s)]
*  It's not Comedy Central. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1570.28s)]
*  This is a model now because of you and YouTube. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1571.76s)]
*  This is a viable alternative to the Netflix Comedy Central special, whatever. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1575.28s)]
*  So it's like you need the power of these social media companies to reach people. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1579.84s)]
*  So doing podcasts and you do the YouTube special, that's an arm of it. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1584.1999999999998s)]
*  And then you disseminate. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1589.12s)]
*  Ari Shafir has been very helpful with trying to self-release a special. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1590.8799999999999s)]
*  So you chop it up into clips. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1595.08s)]
*  This is what I did in my last one. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1596.6s)]
*  And you just chop up because most people are going to access you via clips. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1599.04s)]
*  Everyone has time for 30 seconds. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1603.1999999999998s)]
*  Because the hour long special is kind of for jazz heads. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1605.84s)]
*  You got to be a real stand-up comedy nerd to sit down and watch an hour. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1608.52s)]
*  Jazz head. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1612.52s)]
*  For real. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1613.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1614.52s)]
*  I swear it is because I was talking to Roy Wood Jr. and sometimes because we're [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1615.52s)]
*  in stand-up, we just think it's the world because it is our world. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1620.04s)]
*  And we think that it translates to the rest. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1624.6399999999999s)]
*  And he kind of he like bird's eye viewed it for me. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1626.8s)]
*  He's like, yo, when you go on Spotify, stand-up is under jazz. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1630.1599999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1635.92s)]
*  It goes as an art form. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1636.92s)]
*  It's under jazz. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1638.32s)]
*  Jazz is more popular. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1640.52s)]
*  And I'm like, it kind of put everything into focus for me where, you know, I don't have [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1641.6s)]
*  to be as invested. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1646.44s)]
*  I'm like, OK, there's a ceiling to what you can do. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1648.2s)]
*  But anyway, you I need the clips. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1650.36s)]
*  I need the arm of the clips because I had some clips do like 12 mil and stuff. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1653.0s)]
*  And people were able to find me via Instagram reels. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1659.12s)]
*  So when they shadow ban me, it tells you, you can look at your account status and there'll [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1662.94s)]
*  be marks on there. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1668.04s)]
*  It'll say there's like three strikes and stuff. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1669.52s)]
*  And then one of the things it said is your content will not be shown to non followers. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1672.0s)]
*  And that's kind of how the machine works. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1678.02s)]
*  Like your stuff gets suggested to people who may not have known about you. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1679.86s)]
*  So you need that as an artist if you want to grow, like to see your special and your [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1684.06s)]
*  stand-up. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1688.7s)]
*  So you're being suppressed. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1689.7s)]
*  You're being limited. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1690.7s)]
*  How do you know you were shadow banned? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1691.94s)]
*  Because it tells you on your account status. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1693.62s)]
*  And then I had people talking to people who work at IG or Meadow or whatever. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1695.98s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, it's shadow banned. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1700.86s)]
*  What did you do? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1702.58s)]
*  I think it's because it's an election cycle or something. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1704.3s)]
*  It's not even a human doing it. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1707.02s)]
*  I think it just scrapes for buzzwords and just blanket has these suppression on it. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1709.1399999999999s)]
*  So I had this joke. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1716.26s)]
*  That sounds so creepy. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1717.26s)]
*  It sucks because there's no nuance to it. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1719.1399999999999s)]
*  It was just a joke. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1721.2199999999998s)]
*  You know my Fahim Works on Stuff show? [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1722.9799999999998s)]
*  I do it on YouTube sometimes where I'm just working on material. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1724.62s)]
*  I just do it to feed the algo. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1727.5s)]
*  And sometimes there's a great joke that works. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1728.9399999999998s)]
*  And I just post it on a reel because it's like 80% of the way there and I'm just feeding [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1731.32s)]
*  the algo. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1734.6599999999999s)]
*  So this joke, I post it on all of them. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1736.06s)]
*  I do a clip and then I post it on all the social media platforms. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1739.5s)]
*  So it remained on TikTok and all the other ones was fine. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1742.5s)]
*  And usually TikTok is very draconian. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1744.62s)]
*  They don't like it because it's mostly kids. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1746.86s)]
*  So the joke, it's a non sequitur. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1749.4199999999998s)]
*  I don't know where I'm like, I just want to let you guys know Hamas is hiding at my ex-girlfriend's [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1753.3s)]
*  house. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1758.26s)]
*  So that's the joke. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1759.26s)]
*  It's like saying something without saying something. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1762.06s)]
*  It's just a joke. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1765.06s)]
*  It's a joke. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1766.62s)]
*  Oh my god, we can't have jokes about where Hamas is hiding? [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1767.62s)]
*  That's all I said. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1770.4199999999998s)]
*  And then I think I just saw Hamas on the thumbnail when you post on the grid. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1773.3s)]
*  And then I got a strike for that. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1778.26s)]
*  And then there was no way to reach people and I'm just fucked. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1780.02s)]
*  So any mention of Hamas gets you shot? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1783.26s)]
*  Yes, pretty much. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1785.54s)]
*  I think it's just machine learning or whatever it is. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1786.94s)]
*  It's just scraping the internet for buzzwords. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1789.3799999999999s)]
*  So that was like a hot button issue and stuff. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1791.7s)]
*  And there's no nuance applied to the situation or the joke. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1794.1399999999999s)]
*  So it just sees Hamas and then my account got hit like that. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1798.58s)]
*  So is it any joke about Hamas or just mentioning Hamas? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1802.58s)]
*  I don't think the joke was even taken into consideration. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1806.02s)]
*  I think they just saw Hamas on a thumbnail or Hamas on a caption, not knowing that it's [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1809.86s)]
*  a guy on stage doing a joke. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1814.6999999999998s)]
*  And there's layers to this. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1817.4599999999998s)]
*  Did you appeal it? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1818.4599999999998s)]
*  Yes, I tried to appeal it and then it was just stuck in review forever. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1819.4599999999998s)]
*  So nothing was going to happen. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1822.66s)]
*  I was pretty much fucked. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1825.3000000000002s)]
*  So I know influencers in LA and stuff. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1826.5800000000002s)]
*  And sometimes when they're pretty high up on IG, they have a contact or something more [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1829.8600000000001s)]
*  than a nebulous. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1833.9s)]
*  Because these companies are so... [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1834.9s)]
*  There's no point person. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1837.18s)]
*  I think it's like that for a reason. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1838.3000000000002s)]
*  So they tried to help me out. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1840.42s)]
*  They had a guy and we're going back and forth and nothing was getting done. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1842.5s)]
*  And luckily I met a large agency, like a talent agency, and they were going at it too, trying [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1845.98s)]
*  to help. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1850.42s)]
*  Just a week ago, it got lifted. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1852.58s)]
*  A week ago? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1854.4599999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1856.02s)]
*  And then so the joke is up, whereas before it wasn't. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1857.02s)]
*  So it's like it didn't even happen. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1859.6599999999999s)]
*  It's like I had someone vouch for me and then they... [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1861.1799999999998s)]
*  Hands were off. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1863.86s)]
*  It was fine. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1864.86s)]
*  But only because I had the might of this talent agency. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1865.86s)]
*  If I was a regular guy, I would just be fucked. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1868.1s)]
*  Well that is the thing about an agency, you can get in contact with someone who... [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1870.1s)]
*  There's a value in that for sure. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1874.62s)]
*  Yeah, so much. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1876.02s)]
*  Especially in this weird time. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1877.02s)]
*  You also have to realize from their perspective, they're managing at scale literally billions [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1878.5s)]
*  of people. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1882.8999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1883.8999999999999s)]
*  I mean Facebook and Instagram are all the same company, right? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1884.8999999999999s)]
*  It's all meta. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1888.3799999999999s)]
*  So how many meta customers are there? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1889.3799999999999s)]
*  Let's just guess. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1892.3799999999999s)]
*  So many. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1893.6599999999999s)]
*  Isn't it like a small nation when you add up how many Facebook users? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1894.6599999999999s)]
*  I don't think it's a very small nation. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1896.58s)]
*  I think it's a really big one. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1898.98s)]
*  I think it's a really big one. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1900.6599999999999s)]
*  I want to say it's north of two billion. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1902.3s)]
*  That's a big ass country. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1906.6599999999999s)]
*  It's an imperfect solution. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1909.26s)]
*  Daily active users on meta products is 3.19 billion. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1910.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1918.6599999999999s)]
*  That's half. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1919.6599999999999s)]
*  That's so many people. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1920.6599999999999s)]
*  That's a lot of people. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1921.6599999999999s)]
*  You have to think from their perspective that they think they have an obligation somehow [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1923.1s)]
*  to maintain a certain level of discourse on their platform. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1930.06s)]
*  This is how you could establish it initially. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1936.98s)]
*  But then when you get people in there that are very politically biased and you get people [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1939.74s)]
*  in there that are socially biased and they only want one perspective being heard and [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1944.02s)]
*  then you get a lot of people self-censoring because they self-censor because they're like, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1950.26s)]
*  hey, I don't know what I can say and what I can't say. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1954.06s)]
*  Now I'm like that. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1956.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1957.7s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1958.7s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1959.7s)]
*  Twitter does not do that. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1960.7s)]
*  X does not do that. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1961.7s)]
*  I don't like calling it X. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1962.7s)]
*  I still call it Twitter. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1963.7s)]
*  I'm old school, bro. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1964.7s)]
*  I'm old school. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1965.7s)]
*  Because it's not an X. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1967.42s)]
*  You can't make an X. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1968.42s)]
*  You make a tweet. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1969.42s)]
*  I tweeted it. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1970.42s)]
*  You X'd it. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1971.42s)]
*  No, I say X'd it. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1972.42s)]
*  I ride hard for Elon. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1974.3400000000001s)]
*  I'm like I was on X and I was just drafting a bunch of X's and then I X'd it. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1975.3400000000001s)]
*  What do you call it? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1979.98s)]
*  Tweet? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1980.98s)]
*  Oh, that's Jack Dorsey. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1981.98s)]
*  This is Elon. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1982.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1983.98s)]
*  The old days, kids. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1984.98s)]
*  It's just ... [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1985.98s)]
*  So it's nice to have my account back. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1986.98s)]
*  But I love that it's wild. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1989.98s)]
*  The Twitter thing is ... I mean some of it is disturbing. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1992.06s)]
*  Some people get comfortable enough to just really speak their mind about things. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1995.46s)]
*  They're like oh my God. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1998.5s)]
*  Well, that's the thing about social media too is sometimes when you're in a close knit [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=1999.5s)]
*  circle your buddies kind of check you like hey what are you doing? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2004.8600000000001s)]
*  But social media, some people have a lot of rope and you're like oh no. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2007.54s)]
*  Yeah and especially isolated people. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2011.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2013.78s)]
*  I see my friends get nutty on the road. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2014.78s)]
*  I'll get nutty. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2016.26s)]
*  You could tell your buddy has been on the road for too long. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2017.26s)]
*  They do a video in a hotel room or something and you're like oh no, they're losing their [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2020.22s)]
*  mind. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2023.94s)]
*  I've been guilty of that too. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2025.42s)]
*  Just when you're not surrounded by community and people and you're just a brain floating [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2026.98s)]
*  on the road. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2031.7s)]
*  The number one key that I found very early is go on the road with your friends. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2032.7s)]
*  I'm lucky. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2036.5s)]
*  I've entered a phase in my career where now I'm starting to be able to do that. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2037.5s)]
*  Whereas before you're not making enough money. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2041.06s)]
*  So you're just beholden to whoever they book as a feature. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2043.46s)]
*  And you're just stuck in a hotel. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2047.8200000000002s)]
*  You're walking across a freeway to go to a Cracker Barrel and kill time. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2049.86s)]
*  I just had a long time ago, like 98 to do that. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2053.02s)]
*  Just bring, just pay more money. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2057.62s)]
*  Give them the money. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2060.66s)]
*  Just make less money but have a good time. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2062.18s)]
*  It's worth it. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2065.18s)]
*  Dude it's everything. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2066.18s)]
*  It's everything. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2067.18s)]
*  Make less money, have a good time. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2068.18s)]
*  Make more money, have a bad time, not fun. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2070.48s)]
*  You don't like that. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2073.4s)]
*  That's not a good feeling. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2074.4s)]
*  Make less money, have a good time. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2075.54s)]
*  And have everybody else have a good time too. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2077.4s)]
*  So it's a bunch of guys who are really good friends. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2079.86s)]
*  Who love each other. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2082.9s)]
*  Been on the road forever. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2083.9s)]
*  Going to dinners forever. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2085.6600000000003s)]
*  I've had hundreds of dinners with Ari and Joey Diaz and Duncan. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2086.6600000000003s)]
*  So when we get together it's just joy. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2091.9s)]
*  It's the best. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2093.38s)]
*  It's just joy. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2094.38s)]
*  It's just being with your favorite people. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2095.38s)]
*  Having a good time. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2097.42s)]
*  And doing a thing that you can't believe you get paid to do. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2098.42s)]
*  I'm able to do that now. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2102.1s)]
*  I think, you know, I mean I have to say thank you for. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2103.7400000000002s)]
*  No, you're able to do it from your talent. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2106.42s)]
*  I know. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2108.46s)]
*  This is a platform. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2109.66s)]
*  Because I wasn't a Netflix guy. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2110.66s)]
*  I wasn't a Comedy Central guy. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2112.58s)]
*  Which doesn't make any sense to me. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2114.9s)]
*  That just shows me that Comedy Central and Netflix don't. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2116.18s)]
*  Look at how many of my friends and peers are just skyrocketing and they weren't the guys [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2119.38s)]
*  they picked. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2124.16s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2125.16s)]
*  So it's kind of validating and refreshing. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2126.16s)]
*  And it's cool to see comedy policing itself. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2127.66s)]
*  And just promoting guys who are in the trenches and know what's up. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2131.14s)]
*  Not some guy who has a communications degree. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2134.34s)]
*  I think there's a lot of comedy nerds now too. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2136.82s)]
*  That are really into comedy. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2139.9s)]
*  They're really, because they get to see how the sausage is made from all the podcasts. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2141.2200000000003s)]
*  You know, it's so like really before that I always said this. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2146.1000000000004s)]
*  Like there's so few conversations with great standups that exist like from the George Carlin [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2149.9s)]
*  days or Richard Pryor days. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2156.86s)]
*  There's not hours and hours of Pryor just sitting around talking about things. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2158.98s)]
*  Which would have been amazing. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2162.98s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2164.94s)]
*  Can you imagine Richard Pryor or George Carlin had a podcast? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2166.54s)]
*  It's pretty nuts I know. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2169.58s)]
*  Oh my god it would be insane. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2170.58s)]
*  It would be insane. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2172.38s)]
*  And George has done some conversations where he talked about his writing process. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2173.66s)]
*  He talked about the art form itself. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2178.2200000000003s)]
*  But he had a very specific way of doing it that most people don't do it that way. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2180.5s)]
*  He would write a monologue. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2184.14s)]
*  Yeah, I saw that. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2185.14s)]
*  And then he would just sort of punch it up a little bit. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2186.14s)]
*  That monologue would be his monologue for the year. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2188.02s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2189.78s)]
*  But it was rigid and he knew his beats and stuff. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2190.78s)]
*  Totally different process. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2193.2200000000003s)]
*  Totally different process. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2194.5s)]
*  Because in the end he became this guy who was a comic as much as he was a social critic. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2195.5s)]
*  It was like both things were the same. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2203.1s)]
*  It was still a great comic clearly. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2205.14s)]
*  But he was also a great social critic. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2207.3799999999997s)]
*  And he had, because he didn't have a podcast, his view of the world came out in a standup [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2210.8199999999997s)]
*  and he had to figure out a way to make that funny. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2218.62s)]
*  And that was like his great challenge. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2220.3799999999997s)]
*  Well it gets so distilled when that's here. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2222.02s)]
*  Because we can talk at length and approximate it. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2224.06s)]
*  And you can go back on what you said and go, you know, actually now that I'm thinking about [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2227.7s)]
*  it, I can see how you would look at it the other way too. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2231.8199999999997s)]
*  Which is so goddamn important. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2235.5s)]
*  Comedy fans are getting very granular. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2237.74s)]
*  It's kind of cool. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2239.42s)]
*  I think comedy has always been popular but not like this. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2240.42s)]
*  And I almost feel like people are discovering standup this day and age sort of like the [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2243.74s)]
*  way they used to discover music. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2249.46s)]
*  People are taking ownership of discovering comedians. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2251.1s)]
*  Because even me, I'm kind of like under the radar. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2254.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm pretty niche. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2258.02s)]
*  And when a comedy fan likes me, there's just like a level of fandom. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2259.2200000000003s)]
*  It's like they found a cool record at a record shop. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2263.82s)]
*  Because of the advent of YouTube and Instagram, people aren't just accepting whatever is being [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2267.1400000000003s)]
*  fed to them through a corporate pipe. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2273.02s)]
*  Right, which used to be the case. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2275.82s)]
*  Like if you weren't picked before, you couldn't do anything. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2277.7799999999997s)]
*  That was the only way to even get in front of people. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2281.3799999999997s)]
*  It was like you had to be the corporate pick. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2283.18s)]
*  Otherwise you were just toiling in obscurity. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2285.4599999999996s)]
*  There was no way to even be seen. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2287.2599999999998s)]
*  But now there's all these ways to circumvent the traditional, like Schultz was saying something [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2289.5s)]
*  is like, like younger generations and stuff, they don't know where they saw it or like [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2293.66s)]
*  what the medium is of the branding. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2299.74s)]
*  They just know they saw it on a TV. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2301.22s)]
*  Whether it's YouTube, whether it's Netflix, whether it's Amazon. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2303.2999999999997s)]
*  That type of branding is almost like legacy thinking from when I was coming up and you [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2307.2999999999997s)]
*  were coming up and there was a way to do it. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2311.06s)]
*  People just like good now. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2314.46s)]
*  Well they like what they like too and there's plenty of variety. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2316.82s)]
*  There's all sorts of different comics out there now that are really popular. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2319.94s)]
*  It's a really interesting time. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2323.22s)]
*  I think like for stand-up, like for the art form, I don't think there's ever been a better [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2324.66s)]
*  time. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2328.2599999999998s)]
*  There's never been more of it. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2329.2599999999998s)]
*  There's never been more good ones. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2330.94s)]
*  There's never been more good ones coming up. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2332.34s)]
*  And that's one of the more interesting things about watching the club is occasionally I [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2334.9s)]
*  get to see these people that audition to be door people. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2338.46s)]
*  Those are all comics. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2341.9s)]
*  And I get to see them grow. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2343.54s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2345.06s)]
*  It's fun to watch, man. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2346.06s)]
*  It's fun to watch people inspired and that energy is in the whole room, you know, because [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2347.14s)]
*  there's all these different levels. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2352.2599999999998s)]
*  These guys like Assan and Derek who are now going on the road and killing it on the road. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2354.18s)]
*  David Lucas is killing it on the road. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2357.98s)]
*  William Montgomery is killing it on the road. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2359.54s)]
*  And then there's like the headliners that come in that are there all the time like Shane [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2362.1s)]
*  and Duncan and Tom Segura and all these people that come in to fuck around. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2365.34s)]
*  But there's this feeling that starts at the bottom. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2369.86s)]
*  It starts with the base. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2373.34s)]
*  It starts with the people that are inspired about making it still. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2375.1s)]
*  And then there's the people that are just getting in and there's the people that are [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2379.22s)]
*  in and then there's the people that are on television and everybody knows who they are [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2382.46s)]
*  and they scream when they go on stage. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2385.94s)]
*  And then there's Ron White. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2386.94s)]
*  You know, there's those people. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2387.94s)]
*  So it's like you get to see how we're all just the same thing. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2389.82s)]
*  We're all just artists for lack of a pretentious word. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2393.6200000000003s)]
*  We're like Pokemon, just different evolution. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2396.46s)]
*  We're just doing a weird art form. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2397.94s)]
*  We're doing a weird art form that hasn't really until now been documented as to how to go [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2399.5800000000004s)]
*  about doing the process and how each one of us went about doing the process. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2405.02s)]
*  And I think people are interested in that. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2409.42s)]
*  Just like I'm interested in that motherfucker that makes wood, wood tools. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2410.7000000000003s)]
*  I love when people love things. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2414.9s)]
*  I do. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2417.3s)]
*  I give it something that I don't do. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2418.3s)]
*  I love when people love things. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2419.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2421.82s)]
*  Anything, man. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2422.82s)]
*  Anything. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2423.82s)]
*  Well, it's so interesting how the blueprint is to make it whatever you want to call it [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2424.82s)]
*  in comedy has shifted so fast in the past couple of years because when I was coming [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2429.7400000000002s)]
*  up it was SNL. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2434.7000000000003s)]
*  It was doing like a late night set. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2436.7000000000003s)]
*  It was doing premium blend, like these smaller showcase type sets. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2439.02s)]
*  And then you do a half hour, like a half hour on Comedy Central was huge. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2443.38s)]
*  Dane had a monster half hour. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2446.7400000000002s)]
*  Just gaffe again. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2449.5s)]
*  Louie, you know, these were like people's entry points to these people. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2450.5s)]
*  And then now there's really those things don't exist. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2454.26s)]
*  I was taking... [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2458.1800000000003s)]
*  What's the viral clip now? [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2459.1800000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2460.46s)]
*  So I was on the road and I took, I was doing cobs and I brought Matt Lockwood, he's a comedian [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2461.46s)]
*  from the store. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2465.26s)]
*  And we're just sitting eating ice cream on the bench and I'm talking to the young comics [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2466.26s)]
*  and I'm like, what do you guys pine for now? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2470.94s)]
*  What is the thing? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2474.6600000000003s)]
*  When I was coming up, I knew what the thing was, like what we all wanted. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2475.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2478.42s)]
*  It was like a JFL showcase. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2479.42s)]
*  It was a late night set. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2481.3799999999997s)]
*  Just for laughs. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2482.7s)]
*  Just for laughs. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2483.7s)]
*  Montreal. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2484.7s)]
*  The big set of your life is in French Canon. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2485.7s)]
*  It is. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2486.7s)]
*  And then you make an Arby's joke and you're like, oh, you don't have Arby's? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2487.7s)]
*  Panic. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2490.8599999999997s)]
*  That would have been good to know in front of all these suits. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2491.8599999999997s)]
*  What else is in the news? [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2494.2999999999997s)]
*  So I go, what's your thing? [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2496.5s)]
*  What are you... [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2498.1s)]
*  And he's like, there's really nothing. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2499.1s)]
*  That was weird to me that they had no touchdown. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2501.42s)]
*  And then he goes, maybe like a clip goes viral or a podcast. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2503.74s)]
*  It's just so nebulous now. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2508.8599999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2510.58s)]
*  There's no hard blueprint. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2511.58s)]
*  Well, the blueprint before was kind of... [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2513.14s)]
*  The problem was it involved other stuff. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2516.66s)]
*  The blueprint involved like getting a sitcom, getting a talk show, getting a something. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2518.9399999999996s)]
*  It always involved that. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2523.1s)]
*  A means to an end, a springboard. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2524.8199999999997s)]
*  You couldn't just be a comic. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2526.66s)]
*  You had to be a wacky neighbor. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2527.66s)]
*  But that was the thing that always bummed me out the most about Richard Jenney. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2529.22s)]
*  Richard Jenney, when he died, was one of the best comics ever, but was felt like a failure [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2533.14s)]
*  because he didn't become Jim Carrey, because he didn't become the guy who did the movies. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2540.02s)]
*  He had a TV show, it was called Platypus Man, that was on like one of those burgeoning networks, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2545.22s)]
*  one of those new networks. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2549.5s)]
*  Like what was it? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2550.5s)]
*  WB. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2551.5s)]
*  WB, one of those. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2552.5s)]
*  It was the 2B of it today. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2553.5s)]
*  It was one of those weird networks where like they started offering people deals to do shows [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2554.5s)]
*  that maybe wouldn't have got a show at NBC or ABC. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2559.3799999999997s)]
*  But he was a great comic, man. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2562.4s)]
*  A great fucking comic. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2564.08s)]
*  And he never liked the fact that he was just a comic. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2566.08s)]
*  What was crazy is if you plug him in today, he'd be a killer. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2570.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2574.2000000000003s)]
*  The renaissance. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2575.2000000000003s)]
*  It's like you're enough. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2576.2000000000003s)]
*  As a comic, you're enough. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2577.2000000000003s)]
*  Whereas that used to never be the case. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2578.6800000000003s)]
*  It was like what else do you do? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2579.92s)]
*  What such a disrespected art form. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2581.52s)]
*  It's something that everybody loves, but nobody takes that seriously because it seems like [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2584.56s)]
*  the person on stage is doing what you can do. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2590.56s)]
*  They're just talking. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2592.7200000000003s)]
*  I know, I know. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2593.7200000000003s)]
*  But they get up there and they learn very quickly. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2594.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, well what if they get up there? [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2595.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2596.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, you ever have a drunk person who's like, I'll do it sometimes. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2597.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm like, all right, let's try it. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2599.7200000000003s)]
*  Let's see what you got. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2600.7200000000003s)]
*  And then everyone hates them. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2601.7200000000003s)]
*  You wanted this, dude. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2604.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2605.96s)]
*  Well, it's just people think, and then there's people that want to do it and just don't know [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2606.96s)]
*  how to do it. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2610.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2611.6s)]
*  There's a lot of that. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2612.6s)]
*  I'll get that after shows, some young comics. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2613.6s)]
*  What do I do? [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2614.6s)]
*  I've been writing stuff. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2615.6s)]
*  I'm like, you just got to get up. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2616.6s)]
*  You just got to walk under the fire. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2617.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2618.6s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to do that first open mic night. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2619.7599999999998s)]
*  After the first one, it'll be a lot easier. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2621.44s)]
*  The first one's the hardest one for sure. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2623.2s)]
*  I always tell them. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2625.2s)]
*  The first one, I was fucking terrified. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2626.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2627.2s)]
*  But the fact, if you even do it, do three minutes, and even if it's terrible, that is [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2628.2s)]
*  99% further than most people ever do. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2632.52s)]
*  So many people talk, but they never even, like bomb for three minutes. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2635.92s)]
*  That is a win even, for real. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2640.16s)]
*  Because you know what it feels like at least. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2642.2s)]
*  If you have gotten laughs and then you bomb, I think that's better. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2644.04s)]
*  Because at least you know you can get laughs. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2650.72s)]
*  But if you start off bombing, the road to actually getting laughs, like if you bomb [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2652.48s)]
*  out of the gate, first time on stage, just death. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2656.68s)]
*  Not even a chuckle. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2659.52s)]
*  Well if you come back after that happens, then- [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2661.92s)]
*  Yeah, you're an animal. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2665.04s)]
*  Or you're a crazy person. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2666.04s)]
*  Sure. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2668.04s)]
*  But those are both great assets as a stand-up comedian. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2669.04s)]
*  Occasionally. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2672.04s)]
*  The crazy person isn't always, you know, the crazy person isn't always, that's not really- [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2673.04s)]
*  Right, you have to harness the crazy. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2678.52s)]
*  Yeah, some people it's not harnessable. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2680.24s)]
*  You know, it's a thousand horsepower engine on a fucking kid's bike. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2682.96s)]
*  Like what do I do with this? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2685.24s)]
*  They have like a little kid's bike with a fucking giant four-bed engine on it. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2686.24s)]
*  Oh, I also gotta thank you because, I mean it reminds me, I brought my parents to tonight [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2691.04s)]
*  show, and that's because of your podcast. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2697.92s)]
*  I remember I was doing, I forget which one, I've been on a few times, but like, you're [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2700.24s)]
*  like, have your parents seen you before? [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2704.72s)]
*  And I'm like, uh, nah, they saw me do the Apollo when I was 18, and then I got booed [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2707.04s)]
*  at the Apollo. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2713.6s)]
*  And that was the first, I was like a few months into doing stand-up. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2714.6s)]
*  And they're from Afghanistan, and this is not a thing you do, and they wanted me to [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2718.92s)]
*  quit, and it was just very disgraceful of me doing this, and they see me get booed by [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2723.16s)]
*  4,000 people. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2728.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm telling the story on the, I think, one or two, I guess. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2730.0s)]
*  So I get booed off stage and all that, and then you're like, they gotta come see you [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2733.7200000000003s)]
*  again, man, you're great. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2739.32s)]
*  And I go, I just have this mental block because that was so bad that I just, it's like an [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2740.32s)]
*  emotional thing you just put in a closet and you just ignore it. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2747.76s)]
*  Because I just wanted to keep on doing comedy on my own and keeping my parents and stuff [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2751.8s)]
*  separate, and then you're like, they gotta come see you. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2758.08s)]
*  And then on the podcast, I was like, I just always had this fantasy of like, when they [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2761.2599999999998s)]
*  see me, it being so good to counteract how bad that experience was, that it would be [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2766.3799999999997s)]
*  like a celebration that everything is okay, your son turned out okay, all the worries [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2772.8199999999997s)]
*  you had, you don't have to worry anymore. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2777.7599999999998s)]
*  So I think after I spoke it into existence on your pod, I actually went about doing it, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2781.5s)]
*  so I hit up the booker of The Tonight Show, and I'm like, I mean, I guess I could have [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2787.26s)]
*  always done it, I just never, I know the booker, I go, can I do The Tonight Show? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2791.2200000000003s)]
*  I'd love to do it, I told him the whole story of like, my parents have never seen me since [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2795.5400000000004s)]
*  that thing, this is like an emotional thing I need to take care of. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2798.7400000000002s)]
*  Like this isn't even about comedy anymore, this is just like healing. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2801.7000000000003s)]
*  It's been this monkey on my back for 20 years, 21 years, you know? [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2805.94s)]
*  And then he's like, send me a tape. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2810.6600000000003s)]
*  I sent him a tape. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2812.46s)]
*  So I actually did the work, I finally just went about doing the work. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2814.5400000000004s)]
*  I went to the improv, I put a tape together, I sent it to him, he's like, this is great, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2817.06s)]
*  come and do it. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2821.22s)]
*  So then I flew my parents out to New York, and it was just very therapeutic to be able [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2822.9s)]
*  to give this to my parents because they know what The Tonight Show is, it was a celebration. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2827.98s)]
*  This is way bigger than, like I love The Tonight Show, thank you for letting me do it and all [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2835.2599999999998s)]
*  that stuff, but in the grand scheme of like, entertainment and needle moving, it's not [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2837.94s)]
*  what it used to be, you know? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2842.2999999999997s)]
*  We used to do The Tonight Show when people were honking and shouting your name from cars [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2844.06s)]
*  and shit. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2847.54s)]
*  That's how I found out about Richard Jennings. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2848.54s)]
*  Oh, his Tonight Show appearance? [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2849.54s)]
*  Yeah, I saw him on The Tonight Show. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2851.02s)]
*  But this was just to give my parents a night out and a memory and a story for their parents, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2852.82s)]
*  so I wore a suit, I brought them out, they got to meet Jimmy, they got to meet The Roots, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2857.14s)]
*  The Roots came in, because I'm like friends with The Roots somehow. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2862.86s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2867.46s)]
*  Yeah, they're like, oh, your son is amazing, blah, blah, blah, you raised a good kid and [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2868.46s)]
*  all that. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2873.02s)]
*  So it was everything I could ever dream of it being, and that stems from your pod, you [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2874.22s)]
*  know? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2880.9s)]
*  Well, it stems from you, dude. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2881.9s)]
*  I know. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2882.9s)]
*  You put it together. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2883.9s)]
*  But still, just when you talk about things and you speak something into existence, I [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2884.9s)]
*  think that's valuable, you know? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2889.14s)]
*  Sure, but you also have to work at it. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2890.14s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2892.42s)]
*  You had to put that set together, you had to work at it. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2893.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2895.66s)]
*  You've got to be real careful with that speak things into existence talk, because you're [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2896.66s)]
*  a very dedicated and disciplined writer. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2900.7s)]
*  You write all the time, you're always working on new material, you're always working on [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2903.94s)]
*  your material, you put a lot of time and effort into stand-up comedy. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2906.78s)]
*  People say that, that's nice, thank you, but I mean, I just develop systems where it doesn't [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2910.78s)]
*  feel, because when people are like, oh, you write a lot, it doesn't feel like I write [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2914.66s)]
*  a lot because I just have systems and processes where over time I look at my notes and I just [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2918.34s)]
*  have a bunch of stuff. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2924.38s)]
*  I think people have such an aversion to writing, they think that you have to go to a log cabin, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2926.3s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2930.94s)]
*  And there's a typewriter and then you like do a pipe and you're like, what's funny? [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2931.94s)]
*  Whereas I've gotten my process to a point where I just live life and if something happens, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2937.34s)]
*  I jot it in my phone and you jot enough things in your phone, that list is pretty long. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2941.98s)]
*  And then I developed that Fahim works on stuff and his friends drop by show. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2947.46s)]
*  I developed it during COVID on accident, like the jam in the van was the only venue doing [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2951.98s)]
*  shows and I had already headlined there. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2957.3399999999997s)]
*  They go, you want to do another one? [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2959.62s)]
*  I'm like, how about this for an idea? [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2961.2599999999998s)]
*  I go, I just have all these bits that I never get around to trying. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2963.3399999999997s)]
*  I emcee the show, I have a piece of paper up there. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2966.9s)]
*  I'm just kind of like a reading. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2969.42s)]
*  I'm just like spaghetti against the wall. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2970.74s)]
*  And this goes back to people, comedy fans being savvy now where they know the process [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2972.22s)]
*  and I have enough fans at this point now where like they want to see how the sausage gets [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2977.14s)]
*  made. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2981.2599999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2982.2599999999998s)]
*  I do like 10 minutes in between acts, just trying stuff out and then I bring up people [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2983.42s)]
*  doing great sets, you know what I mean? [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2987.42s)]
*  So the bulk of the integrity of the show isn't based on me trying new stuff because I have [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2989.1400000000003s)]
*  great comics interspersed. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2994.46s)]
*  So it's a very low stakes way for me to try a bunch of new material. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2996.6200000000003s)]
*  So after the great act goes, I do 10 more minutes of bullshit or whatever, bring up [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=2999.92s)]
*  the next comic. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3004.1000000000004s)]
*  So it's a safe space for me to be able to try new stuff. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3005.38s)]
*  And they know what you're doing too. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3008.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3009.42s)]
*  I think he works on stuff and his friends drop by. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3010.58s)]
*  So I think it's a good name of a show. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3013.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3015.1s)]
*  And it mitigates expectations. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3016.1s)]
*  I think a lot of times comics when they're like, oh man, I'm so afraid. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3017.6s)]
*  I can't write stuff. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3021.06s)]
*  It's like make the show where you can. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3022.1s)]
*  Because I'm Bobby sometimes. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3025.42s)]
*  First of all, it's very cool to see Bobby on the pod. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3027.1s)]
*  I'm surprised it took. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3028.7000000000003s)]
*  I know it took forever. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3029.7000000000003s)]
*  It took forever. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3030.7000000000003s)]
*  I told Bobby, I'm like, I'm so glad that you finally did it. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3031.7000000000003s)]
*  He wouldn't do it forever. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3033.7400000000002s)]
*  Forever. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3034.7400000000002s)]
*  Bobby's weird like that sometimes. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3035.7400000000002s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3036.7400000000002s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3037.7400000000002s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3039.06s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3040.06s)]
*  I don't even remember. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3041.06s)]
*  We talked about Duda like a hundred times whenever I'd see him at the store. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3042.06s)]
*  I know. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3045.5s)]
*  And he's just knocking the middle. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3046.5s)]
*  What made him want to do it this time? [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3048.74s)]
*  What put him over the top? [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3049.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3050.74s)]
*  I should ask him. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3051.74s)]
*  He just, you know, he's going to be in town. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3052.74s)]
*  One of the times, right. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3053.74s)]
*  We hooked it up. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3054.74s)]
*  It was fun. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3055.74s)]
*  It was fun hanging out with him. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3056.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3057.74s)]
*  He's awesome. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3058.74s)]
*  I love Bobby. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3059.74s)]
*  He was the first comic to take me on the road. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3060.74s)]
*  Like a headliner to actually take me on the road with him. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3062.7s)]
*  He's a genuinely sweet guy. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3064.62s)]
*  Genuinely sweet guy. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3067.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3068.62s)]
*  He's always good with other comics too. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3069.62s)]
*  He's fucking hilarious. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3070.62s)]
*  So funny. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3071.62s)]
*  He's hilarious to hang out with too. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3072.62s)]
*  He's a feral cat dude. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3073.62s)]
*  I had him on my pod one time and like I had an idea of where I wanted the pod to go and [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3075.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm just kind of like mentally trying to corral Bobby and there's no way you can't. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3081.46s)]
*  That's silly. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3086.54s)]
*  You need like a red cape. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3087.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3089.54s)]
*  I need a possum guy just to grab Bobby off the wall. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3090.54s)]
*  I spent, this is how stupid I am. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3093.58s)]
*  I spent 20 minutes today watching dudes do flips over bowls. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3095.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3101.38s)]
*  Because there's dudes, this is a new sport where the bowls run at them and they flip [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3102.38s)]
*  over the bowls. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3107.78s)]
*  They do like front flips. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3108.78s)]
*  So they're acrobats. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3109.98s)]
*  The red cloth isn't enough? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3110.98s)]
*  Not enough. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3112.7400000000002s)]
*  You're now counting. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3113.7400000000002s)]
*  This is the next evolution. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3114.7400000000002s)]
*  You're counting on your knees and your ankles. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3115.7400000000002s)]
*  These guys, oh that guy got hit. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3118.1000000000004s)]
*  Look at this motherfucker. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3120.38s)]
*  The leaping of the bowls. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3121.78s)]
*  Look at this shit. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3122.78s)]
*  I watched this for 20 minutes today. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3123.78s)]
*  I can't do that without the bowl. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3124.98s)]
*  Bro, this is, you have to be so athletic. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3126.7s)]
*  You're avoiding horns. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3130.26s)]
*  That goes up your asshole. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3132.3s)]
*  You're a dead person. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3133.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3134.38s)]
*  And it happens. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3135.38s)]
*  All the time, man. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3136.38s)]
*  Do you think one of these guys is undefeated? [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3137.38s)]
*  Nope. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3139.02s)]
*  I guarantee you Father Time catches them just like it catches great fighters. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3140.02s)]
*  I bet there's a few of those guys that hang in there a little too long. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3144.82s)]
*  The bowl fighter? [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3148.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3149.3s)]
*  Front flip gets a little sloppy. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3150.3s)]
*  Maybe you got that one bad ankle, but I'll compensate with my right ankle. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3151.76s)]
*  Uh-uh. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3155.0s)]
*  Not this time. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3156.0s)]
*  It's not even a flip. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3157.0s)]
*  It's a somersault. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3158.0s)]
*  This time, you're going headbutton. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3159.0s)]
*  A fucking bowl. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3160.0s)]
*  It's just a, I mean, but it's such a weird, listen, I prefer it to the other thing, the [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3162.5200000000004s)]
*  other bowl fighting thing they do. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3168.36s)]
*  Oh, when they kill it. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3169.96s)]
*  When they stick them full of spears and they compromise it. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3170.96s)]
*  Flipping is just good fun. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3174.4s)]
*  Well, it's just the whole bowl fighting thing. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3175.4s)]
*  I get it back in the dis-eh. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3177.96s)]
*  You ever try to flip? [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3180.28s)]
*  No, I've never tried to flip. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3181.8s)]
*  I used to be able to flip. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3182.8s)]
*  Really? [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3183.8s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3184.8s)]
*  I believe you. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3185.8s)]
*  Yeah, I learned for the high school musical. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3186.8s)]
*  That's like the least manly story, like you ever flip? [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3188.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3192.76s)]
*  How long did it take you to learn? [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3193.76s)]
*  You know, during the summertime, you just have so much free time that I had my best [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3195.76s)]
*  friend across the street. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3199.4s)]
*  I'm like, yo, come over. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3200.4s)]
*  I'm going to try to do a back flip. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3202.0s)]
*  Tell me what I'm doing wrong. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3203.6000000000004s)]
*  So he just had eyes on me and I would try to just do it on the side yard of my parents' [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3204.96s)]
*  house. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3209.6400000000003s)]
*  So I would run. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3210.72s)]
*  Grass is pretty soft. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3211.72s)]
*  You know, I'm not doing it on concrete. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3212.72s)]
*  Sort of. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3213.72s)]
*  It's soft enough. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3214.72s)]
*  But you're 18. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3215.72s)]
*  You have rubber bones. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3216.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3217.72s)]
*  So I would just run, do a round off to back flip. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3218.72s)]
*  But I was doing it sideways. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3222.7599999999998s)]
*  I think when you first start, you want to see the ground the whole time because you're [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3223.7599999999998s)]
*  too afraid to totally let go. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3226.72s)]
*  So he's like, stop going diagonal, go more. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3230.48s)]
*  And then finally I got it. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3232.96s)]
*  So I was doing, I wasn't doing a standing back flip. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3234.52s)]
*  I was doing a round off to back flip. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3237.4s)]
*  And then I learned how to go off a wall. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3239.76s)]
*  And then that's actually easier because you just push off the wall. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3242.44s)]
*  It takes a lot of the rotation out. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3245.7200000000003s)]
*  And then I learned how to have my buddy launch me. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3247.6s)]
*  I actually posted on my Instagram because when I was shadow banned, I was just posting [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3252.6800000000003s)]
*  dancing. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3255.92s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3256.92s)]
*  Because I was in jail. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3257.92s)]
*  I was in jail. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3258.92s)]
*  So I just like. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3259.92s)]
*  How banned were you? [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3262.32s)]
*  Did I still see your stuff? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3263.76s)]
*  I'm unbanned. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3265.76s)]
*  But at the time when you were shadow banned, would that mean I would have a hard time seeing [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3267.1600000000003s)]
*  yourself? [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3270.6800000000003s)]
*  Is it people that follow you? [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3271.6800000000003s)]
*  New people wouldn't be able to see me. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3272.6800000000003s)]
*  I would be able to reach some of. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3274.5200000000004s)]
*  Follows you could see you? [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3276.5200000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3278.0s)]
*  Everybody? [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3279.0s)]
*  Maybe not the entire pie, but if my ceiling was going to be people who already follow [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3280.0s)]
*  me, I wasn't going to reach any new people. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3283.6400000000003s)]
*  That's weird, isn't it? [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3286.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3287.48s)]
*  So then I didn't want to, because I had all these jokes and stuff and I go, I don't want [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3288.48s)]
*  to burn these clips on a suppressed audience. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3291.2400000000002s)]
*  So I just went to my archives and just reposted dance shit. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3295.56s)]
*  But what's funny is like sometimes when you post dance stuff, it brings people who like [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3300.24s)]
*  dance that you wouldn't think. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3305.08s)]
*  Like sometimes you'll like a dance thing and it throws me. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3306.68s)]
*  It throws me for a loop because I wouldn't think Joe Rogan likes a dancing video from [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3309.24s)]
*  me. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3312.96s)]
*  I like all kinds of things, man. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3313.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3315.72s)]
*  And then Juliette Lewis started liking some of this stuff. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3316.72s)]
*  It's like a fucking crazy world. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3318.92s)]
*  And then she asked a question in one of the IGs and I'm like, she's like, oh yeah, did [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3321.0s)]
*  you used to do this for talent shows and stuff? [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3325.76s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, I did it for the high school musical. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3327.52s)]
*  So is there, can you pull it up on? [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3330.92s)]
*  It's a, I have too many dance videos. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3334.4s)]
*  Let me, let's explore this. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3339.32s)]
*  Why is musicals not manly? [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3341.36s)]
*  Probably the singing and dancing. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3345.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3346.4s)]
*  Why is singing and dancing not manly? [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3347.4s)]
*  Particularly evolutionarily speaking, because women have always been impressed by singing [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3349.48s)]
*  and dancing. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3354.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3355.56s)]
*  But you think about Saturday Night Fever. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3356.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3358.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3359.76s)]
*  But think about all the jealous guys and they just call Travolta gay or whatever. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3360.76s)]
*  Because if the girls like, if the girls like something that kind of blends feminine, haters [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3365.72s)]
*  is going to say he's gay. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3371.52s)]
*  Blends feminine. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3373.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3374.44s)]
*  Singing and dancing. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3375.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3376.44s)]
*  But why? [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3377.44s)]
*  If women like it and if it's difficult to do, what makes those two things that are difficult [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3379.16s)]
*  to do that women like? [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3387.64s)]
*  Because it's not a masculine. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3389.52s)]
*  Because men like it watching it too though. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3390.52s)]
*  If it was rock, like if it's leather, guys can get behind that. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3392.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3396.04s)]
*  But if a guy can really dance, that shit's impressive. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3397.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3400.08s)]
*  But it has to be next level. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3401.08s)]
*  It has to be like Michael Jackson or Prince. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3402.08s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3404.56s)]
*  Or like Lance. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3405.56s)]
*  Or like Lance. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3406.56s)]
*  Lance Canstopolous. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3407.68s)]
*  When's Lance coming back? [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3408.68s)]
*  You know? [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3411.24s)]
*  When's Lance coming back? [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3412.24s)]
*  Lance, yeah, I don't know. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3413.24s)]
*  Fahim does a character on stage called Lance Canstopolous and it was always a favorite [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3414.72s)]
*  at the comic store. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3418.88s)]
*  Is he doing Lance tonight? [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3419.88s)]
*  Is he doing Lance tonight? [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3420.88s)]
*  I think he irritated you. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3422.2s)]
*  Well, nah, I mean it's fun. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3424.2799999999997s)]
*  Like stop asking for Lance, I'm right here. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3427.2s)]
*  Fahim's right here motherfucker. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3429.68s)]
*  Like Lance is cannibalizing Fahim. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3430.68s)]
*  It's like that movie, what was it, The Dark Half? [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3433.72s)]
*  What was that book? [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3436.0s)]
*  The Stephen King book with the writer, like he's got like an evil writer in his brain [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3438.2400000000002s)]
*  that writes all the hits. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3441.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3442.6s)]
*  And he comes to life. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3443.6s)]
*  Well, I mean Lance is a part of me. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3444.6s)]
*  The thing is, I almost feel like Lance is who I would be if I didn't have parents. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3447.36s)]
*  I swear to God. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3451.84s)]
*  Because my parents raised me a certain way. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3455.04s)]
*  And even when I have thoughts and stuff, there are so many gates before I kind of say, you [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3457.76s)]
*  know, what I say. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3463.8s)]
*  I'm careful sometimes. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3465.44s)]
*  But then Lance is just pure id and it's dancing and it's candy. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3466.48s)]
*  And it's so fun. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3474.08s)]
*  Also, as an artist too, just as a standup. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3475.08s)]
*  Because when I write jokes and shit, I'm like, it's intricate, you know? [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3477.64s)]
*  What goes here, blah, blah. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3481.88s)]
*  It's mentally taxing. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3483.4s)]
*  But Lance, there's no jokes. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3485.12s)]
*  You show up, they play dance music. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3486.84s)]
*  And I'm going out to the comedy store where they've seen so much high level, cerebral, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3490.36s)]
*  great jokes and stuff. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3496.88s)]
*  And then they're like Lance against Opel is. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3498.92s)]
*  Oh yeah, here Bert bringing Lance up. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3501.36s)]
*  Like pure nonsense. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3516.4s)]
*  No, amazing. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3517.4s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3518.4s)]
*  I know, I know. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3519.4s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3520.4s)]
*  But it really sets. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3521.4s)]
*  Do you have the wig with you? [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3522.4s)]
*  I packed Lance. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3523.4s)]
*  Lance is going on stage tonight. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3524.4s)]
*  Oh shit. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3525.4s)]
*  Lance is going on stage tonight. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3526.4s)]
*  I just love the phrase, I packed Lance. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3527.4s)]
*  Lance is going on stage tonight. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3529.84s)]
*  It's like I get mad if Duncan doesn't bring little hobo. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3530.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3533.12s)]
*  Like where's little hobo? [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3534.12s)]
*  So one time when Adam was still at the store, he was, you know, the manager there, I went [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3535.12s)]
*  up earlier in the night in the OR as me. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3539.6800000000003s)]
*  And then my set's done and Whitney's running late. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3543.04s)]
*  And then Adam tracks me in the hallway. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3547.0s)]
*  He grabs me by the shoulders and he goes, Whitney's running late. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3548.68s)]
*  Get Lance. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3552.2s)]
*  So I'm like Superman. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3558.08s)]
*  So I go into the trunk of my car and then I turn into Lance. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3559.56s)]
*  So this is like three or four comics later and they bring, they go, who's next? [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3565.6s)]
*  They go Lance. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3569.6s)]
*  Comics like what the fuck? [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3570.6s)]
*  They go, all right, Lance against Opel. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3571.6s)]
*  And I go back up for the same audience, but I'm as Lance this time and I dance and shit. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3573.24s)]
*  And then I sit on the stool and I'm like, you guys look strangely familiar. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3578.7599999999998s)]
*  So then I'm like, I do a 10 minute Lance set and then I see Whitney in the back and then [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3583.4399999999996s)]
*  I'm like, ladies and gentlemen, Whitney comics. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3591.52s)]
*  So I got them out of a pinch. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3594.52s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3597.04s)]
*  But I've never done, I guess one other time I did do Lance on the same show, like as Fahim. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3598.04s)]
*  Lance will become Dice. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3602.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I can see that because it's so much fun to do. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3603.92s)]
*  Do you know the Dice story? [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3607.44s)]
*  So no, what was that? [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3609.24s)]
*  Dice's name is Andrew Silverstein. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3610.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3612.24s)]
*  I know he was like a great impressionist and great actor. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3613.24s)]
*  He used to go on stage and he used to do all these characters. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3615.44s)]
*  He used to do John Travolta. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3617.3599999999997s)]
*  He does an amazing John Travolta. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3619.0s)]
*  And then he would do this character called the Dice Man. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3621.48s)]
*  And then the Dice Man became him. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3624.7599999999998s)]
*  What's it? [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3627.96s)]
*  Just singing Elvis in front of like Madison Square Garden. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3649.96s)]
*  I mean, how do you not love him? [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3653.96s)]
*  And it's so good. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3654.96s)]
*  It's amazing. He's amazing. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3655.96s)]
*  Dice is amazing. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3656.96s)]
*  But anyway, that became him. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3657.96s)]
*  He became that character. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3661.96s)]
*  That's him. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3664.16s)]
*  This is it, man. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3665.16s)]
*  You're Lance. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3666.16s)]
*  This is my evolution. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3667.16s)]
*  You are Lance. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3668.16s)]
*  I was a caterpillar. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3669.16s)]
*  You are Lance. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3670.16s)]
*  I am. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3671.16s)]
*  This is my suggestion for your next special after this one that you just did. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3672.16s)]
*  Half Hour of You. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3678.08s)]
*  Short break. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3681.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3682.32s)]
*  Half Hour of Lance. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3683.32s)]
*  It's like speaker box and level below. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3684.6800000000003s)]
*  Like the Outkast album. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3686.2400000000002s)]
*  Like half this, half that. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3687.4s)]
*  That's pretty great. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3689.2000000000003s)]
*  You leave the stage. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3690.2000000000003s)]
*  The stage goes black for like three minutes. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3692.78s)]
*  You fucking swap out clothes, put the wig on, hit yourself a little Dior. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3696.8s)]
*  What do they wear? [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3703.32s)]
*  For the front row? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3704.32s)]
*  What do people that like to wear cologne? [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3705.32s)]
*  What does dudes who like to party and go to clubs wear? [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3706.32s)]
*  Aqua Velvet for sure. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3709.32s)]
*  A guy who goes to clubs. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3710.32s)]
*  A guy's like, what's up girls? [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3711.32s)]
*  What's that guy wearing? [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3713.32s)]
*  Gold chains. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3714.32s)]
*  What's that guy wearing? [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3715.32s)]
*  Jean jacket obviously. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3716.32s)]
*  Wife beater underneath. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3717.32s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3718.32s)]
*  What is the smell though? [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3719.32s)]
*  Probably. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3720.32s)]
*  I typed in cheesy guy cologne in this bottle. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3721.32s)]
*  Some people are really into cologne, man. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3722.32s)]
*  Did you ever get in a cologne? [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3725.32s)]
*  When I was a kid I had Drakkar Noir. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3728.32s)]
*  Oh that was a big one? [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3730.32s)]
*  Drakkar was the bigger one. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3731.32s)]
*  I heard of that. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3732.32s)]
*  All the guys, hey you gotta get Drakkar. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3733.32s)]
*  Girls love it. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3734.32s)]
*  Do they? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3735.32s)]
*  That was good. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3736.32s)]
*  I have no idea. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3737.32s)]
*  Do you think some girls like, ugh. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3738.32s)]
*  No. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3739.32s)]
*  Drakkar. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3741.32s)]
*  No one knows what the fuck he's doing. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3742.32s)]
*  Cool water was big in the 90s. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3744.32s)]
*  Cool water? [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3745.32s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3746.32s)]
*  Oh Tommy was big for me growing up and then Polo Sport was a hot fragrance. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3747.32s)]
*  I used to do the Old Spice aftershave. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3752.32s)]
*  You fucking splash it on your hands, you sting your face. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3755.32s)]
*  Woo! [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3759.32s)]
*  Maybe that? [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3760.32s)]
*  It's functional though too because if I don't do that and I shave with a razor you'll get [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3761.32s)]
*  ingrown. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3764.32s)]
*  Listen to you, it's functional. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3765.32s)]
*  It's functional dude. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3766.32s)]
*  You just go back to being an engineer. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3767.32s)]
*  Just do that. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3768.32s)]
*  It burned but it feel good. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3769.32s)]
*  You just fucking splash that on your face. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3770.32s)]
*  Yeah that's what I'm saying. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3771.32s)]
*  You're like Kevin McCallister. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3772.32s)]
*  Dude I think Lance. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3773.32s)]
*  It's fun. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3774.32s)]
*  Like I'm bringing it back. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3775.32s)]
*  I've been doing it more at the store. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3776.32s)]
*  Would you do that though? [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3777.32s)]
*  That my idea for a special? [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3778.32s)]
*  I would. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3779.32s)]
*  I'll produce it. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3780.32s)]
*  Oh yeah? [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3781.32s)]
*  How about that? [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3782.32s)]
*  Also because this is my third traditional special. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3783.32s)]
*  Like I've done it. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3785.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3786.32s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3787.32s)]
*  So it's kind of, you get bored and there's enough digital IP out there of me doing straight [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3788.32s)]
*  stand up. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3794.32s)]
*  Well you can do both though. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3795.32s)]
*  That's the best part. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3796.32s)]
*  Well you can do both though. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3797.32s)]
*  That's the beauty of what you've got going on. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3798.32s)]
*  So you could just do an entire Lance tour if you wanted to. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3800.32s)]
*  Or an entire Fahim tour if you want. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3804.32s)]
*  You can do whatever you want. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3805.32s)]
*  I also had this idea too because Lance just loves everything. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3806.32s)]
*  He thinks he can do everything. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3811.32s)]
*  He can be an actor. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3812.32s)]
*  He wants to be in action movies. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3813.32s)]
*  He wants to sing and do music. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3814.32s)]
*  So I might want to do where it's like a documentary of Lance putting out an album and an EP. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3817.32s)]
*  So he like tours America doing like shitty venues. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3824.32s)]
*  But he has like three songs on an album. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3829.32s)]
*  And then the in between of doing songs he's just like doing crowd work. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3831.32s)]
*  Like thank you for supporting live music and everything. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3834.32s)]
*  And like how I came up with this song. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3837.32s)]
*  I was taking a shit at Jibole and like just the chords came to me. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3839.32s)]
*  Hit it. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3843.32s)]
*  You know? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3844.32s)]
*  So it's like half music, half comedy. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3845.32s)]
*  That could be a fun different type of special to do. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3847.32s)]
*  Yeah I just love when someone busts out a character. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3850.32s)]
*  You know? [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3853.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3854.32s)]
*  There's a few things you don't see that much in stand up anymore. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3855.32s)]
*  You don't see like a character. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3857.32s)]
*  Because it's scary. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3859.32s)]
*  You'll get shit on a lot. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3861.32s)]
*  When you're a young comic if you do something kind of non-traditional you can get shit on. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3862.32s)]
*  So like luckily Lance happened after I was really established at the comedy store. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3868.32s)]
*  No no no. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3872.32s)]
*  Lance is good. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3873.32s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3874.32s)]
*  I know. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3875.32s)]
*  But even if you weren't established. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3876.32s)]
*  If you came in and just did Lance people would think oh my god that's hilarious. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3877.32s)]
*  But Lance was able to thrive because I already had the... [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3879.32s)]
*  For real. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3882.32s)]
*  Lance is another person dude. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3883.32s)]
*  He is. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3884.32s)]
*  What is that Stevie King book? [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3885.32s)]
*  He is. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3886.32s)]
*  Is it a dark half? [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3887.32s)]
*  Lance was able to thrive because I was already beloved at the store. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3888.32s)]
*  Like I had earned their respect and stuff. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3891.32s)]
*  Because if you start killing with a character and no one knows who you are. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3894.32s)]
*  You're going to get shit on by the like elders and stuff. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3898.32s)]
*  Oh not at the store. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3901.32s)]
*  It's a harder sell than if you have no history as a traditional comic. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3904.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3908.32s)]
*  Because it seems like hacky or a trick. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3909.32s)]
*  So the fact that I can do straights. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3910.32s)]
*  But it's not if it's the dark half. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3912.32s)]
*  Thad Beaumont. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3914.32s)]
*  A parasitic twin removed from inside his skull when he was 12. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3915.32s)]
*  What? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3919.32s)]
*  Since then he's become a critically acclaimed literary writer and a blockbuster crime writer. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3920.32s)]
*  Under the pseudonym George Stark who goes on a murderous rampage when Thad kills him off. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3924.32s)]
*  Is that what you were thinking of? [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3930.32s)]
*  Yeah that's the book. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3932.32s)]
*  It's a crazy, crazy book. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3933.32s)]
*  I mean it's fun doing different character and music stuff. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3935.32s)]
*  Lance is inside of you. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3938.32s)]
*  I did a promo. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3939.32s)]
*  Can you pull it up because I uploaded it. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3940.32s)]
*  You need to feed Lance. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3941.32s)]
*  I will feed Lance for sure. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3942.32s)]
*  Lance is going to go on a murderous rampage. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3943.32s)]
*  This is going to be sort of the way that Tonight Show thing was spoken into existence. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3944.32s)]
*  This is the new thing. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3948.32s)]
*  Can you pull up, I did a promo like a music video for my special. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3951.32s)]
*  It just reminded me of the music. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3955.32s)]
*  I think comics are open to anybody trying anything. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3957.32s)]
*  As long as it's really good. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3962.32s)]
*  But we don't put that same scrutiny on someone trying to stand up for the first time. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3965.32s)]
*  You know like when you see someone doing an open mic night you expect them to suck. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3970.32s)]
*  It's just so fucking hard. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3973.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3974.32s)]
*  But if you see someone doing an open mic night and sucking as a character you're like you ain't never going to make it bitch. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3975.32s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3981.32s)]
*  Can you turn it up? [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3982.32s)]
*  What is this? [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3983.32s)]
*  I have a special promo for new comedy special. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3984.32s)]
*  House money. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3987.32s)]
*  Instead of doing a trailer for my special I'm like let me just do a music video. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3988.32s)]
*  So this kid McCone he directed it. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=3997.32s)]
*  He does a lot of bad friend stuff too. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4002.32s)]
*  So we bang this out in a day. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4004.32s)]
*  You know what's disturbing that that that guy could be a very popular music artist. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4006.32s)]
*  That could be your third career. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4011.32s)]
*  The British actor is so thick. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4014.32s)]
*  Satirical British emo songs. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4018.32s)]
*  I'm not kidding. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4021.32s)]
*  I was listening to tears for fears and I'm like this has to be my promo. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4022.32s)]
*  Bro if you go like way over the top tears for fears like over to the next level of dismay. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4025.32s)]
*  So British. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4032.32s)]
*  Yeah over the top. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4033.32s)]
*  Obnoxiously. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4034.32s)]
*  You could be that's your next career. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4035.32s)]
*  Bro. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4037.32s)]
*  That's your third career. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4038.32s)]
*  I'm just stacking careers today. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4039.32s)]
*  Yeah you're going to stack careers. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4040.32s)]
*  You're going to be a mock emo singer from the UK. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4041.32s)]
*  Somewhere where it never is sunny. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4045.32s)]
*  Scotland or some shit. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4048.32s)]
*  On a lineup who goes where. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4050.32s)]
*  Obviously I can't follow Lance. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4052.32s)]
*  So Lance closes up. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4053.32s)]
*  So it would be me. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4054.32s)]
*  Lance has to close. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4055.32s)]
*  This guy opens. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4056.32s)]
*  Oh he opens. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4057.32s)]
*  He opens with his corny songs. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4058.32s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4059.32s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4060.32s)]
*  You have these songs. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4061.32s)]
*  Everybody goes nuts. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4062.32s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4063.32s)]
*  Short break. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4064.32s)]
*  You come back as Fahim. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4065.32s)]
*  And then everyone's dicks are hard for. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4066.32s)]
*  Short break. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4067.32s)]
*  You kind of hear like. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4068.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4069.32s)]
*  Lance. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4070.32s)]
*  Lance. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4071.32s)]
*  Lance. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4072.32s)]
*  Lance. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4073.32s)]
*  Like on a bleachers. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4074.32s)]
*  And then a spotlight. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4075.32s)]
*  The first one's probably a bad idea. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4076.32s)]
*  The singing's probably right. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4077.32s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4078.32s)]
*  But the other two are really good. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4079.32s)]
*  Those are real. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4080.32s)]
*  But the singing could make it if you really like. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4081.32s)]
*  I don't want it to make it. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4082.7200000000003s)]
*  It was just a fun promo to do. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4083.7200000000003s)]
*  If you wanted to prove a point. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4085.32s)]
*  If you had like this thing in the back of your head and you're like you know what. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4086.32s)]
*  I don't fucking think. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4089.04s)]
*  Like get my Eddie Murphy on. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4090.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4091.84s)]
*  My party all the time. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4092.84s)]
*  That's a jam. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4093.84s)]
*  That is a fucking jam. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4094.84s)]
*  Let's put that on the green room playlist. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4096.52s)]
*  My girl. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4097.92s)]
*  What the money on the time. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4098.92s)]
*  That was produced by Rick James right. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4102.28s)]
*  Joey Diaz you're on the podcast. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4106.96s)]

*  You don't write. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4110.96s)]
*  I called you yesterday. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4111.96s)]

*  Oh don't tell everybody. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4124.8s)]
*  They'll know. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4127.2s)]
*  Now the whole world's going to know. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4128.32s)]
*  Yes. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4129.599999999999s)]

*  And you were a part of the beginning of this. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4162.32s)]
*  You really were because you were like one of the first comics that took a chance to [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4165.860000000001s)]

*  like how big can it get. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4174.6s)]
*  It can get pretty fucking big. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4175.84s)]
*  It can get pretty big man. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4176.84s)]
*  It can get pretty big because there's a lot of new people that are doing it and they're [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4177.84s)]
*  really dedicated. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4180.72s)]
*  And if you're a young comic this seems way more viable than a place like New York or [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4181.88s)]
*  LA that's super saturated. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4187.96s)]
*  And even if you're funny it's hard to get on stage whereas there's more stage time out [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4188.96s)]
*  here. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4193.84s)]
*  There's a ton of stage time. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4194.84s)]
*  And it's just a different environment. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4196.56s)]

*  Yeah but we can't play music anymore. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4214.2s)]
*  Imagine. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4215.96s)]
*  Imagine the song in the back. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4216.96s)]
*  So whack. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4217.96s)]
*  Do you think that we should do my girl wants to party all the time. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4218.96s)]
*  It's the Rogan remix. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4223.12s)]
*  Yeah if I do it too good it'll pick up on the algorithm. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4224.12s)]
*  Is there a way we can just say put the full things on Spotify and just cut out the music [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4228.08s)]
*  chunks and tell people we're doing it? [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4233.56s)]
*  Just trying to figure it out on the fly. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4235.76s)]
*  We might have to tell people we're doing it. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4237.92s)]
*  I don't like being hindered by this nonsense. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4239.8s)]
*  We want to hear party all the time. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4242.9800000000005s)]
*  But it's also it's like what is fair use. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4244.38s)]
*  You know how does that work. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4247.16s)]
*  I don't know the rulings on stuff. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4248.2s)]
*  They should be able to talk about one of the greatest fucking things. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4250.8s)]
*  Songs by a comedian. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4254.400000000001s)]

*  That's nuts. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4258.52s)]
*  Well that's what's crazy. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4259.52s)]
*  He did one or how many specials two two or three in his all time great. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4260.52s)]
*  Beverly Hills Cop comes out I think. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4265.2s)]
*  Oh that's so cool. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4267.52s)]
*  Dude if he wanted to stand up right now if he just wanted to jump back on stage right [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4270.72s)]
*  now he would start murdering. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4273.56s)]
*  Of course. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4274.56s)]
*  Right away murdering. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4275.56s)]
*  Even watching his comedians in cars just being talking to Jerry. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4276.56s)]
*  There's so many great bits in conversation with him. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4281.6s)]
*  Great tragedy that guy doesn't do stand up. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4284.02s)]
*  But he doesn't want to so whatever. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4286.56s)]
*  Did you watch SNL? [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4288.84s)]
*  I watched Shane's monologue. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4291.04s)]
*  Yeah and I watched the Trump sneakers bit. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4292.6s)]
*  That's great man. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4295.16s)]
*  He's such a good sketch performer. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4296.16s)]
*  He's amazing. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4298.12s)]
*  It's rare that someone is really good at stand up and is great at sketch like that too. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4299.64s)]
*  He said he had a good time. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4303.4s)]
*  He said they were for the most part they were cool to him. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4304.4s)]
*  He said it was a good experience. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4308.0s)]
*  He's glad he did it. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4309.72s)]
*  I'm glad he did too. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4310.72s)]
*  It's one of the few times that it's been appointment viewing for SNL. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4313.08s)]
*  Especially for comics and stuff. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4316.72s)]
*  I bet the ratings are bananas. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4318.84s)]
*  My favorite from there when he was on is that Lemu Emu sketch. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4323.96s)]
*  But it got cut for time. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4327.759999999999s)]
*  I'm watching on the internet and I go they didn't air this? [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4328.759999999999s)]
*  This is the best sketch. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4331.44s)]
*  They run their show. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4337.08s)]
*  There's a certain order and maybe it got cut for time or something. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4338.08s)]
*  But when I'm watching I'm like this is the best. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4341.92s)]
*  Imagine putting together a new show every week and it not sucking. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4343.5599999999995s)]

*  What are the odds? [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4348.5199999999995s)]
*  That's so hard to do. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4349.5199999999995s)]
*  Put together a new show every week? [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4351.48s)]
*  That's so hard to do. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4353.16s)]
*  Did that show mean anything to you growing up? [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4354.5599999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4356.8s)]
*  Definitely. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4357.8s)]
*  The John Belushi days. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4358.8s)]
*  I used to watch that. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4362.24s)]
*  If you watch some of those episodes now you could never do any of what they were doing. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4364.320000000001s)]
*  They had some of the wildest shows. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4369.92s)]
*  Those shows were great. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4373.52s)]
*  The old Saturday Night Lives were fucking great. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4374.84s)]
*  They were really fun. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4377.96s)]
*  That was the only place to see something like that too. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4378.96s)]
*  Only place. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4381.4400000000005s)]
*  It was nuts. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4382.4400000000005s)]
*  Then In Living Color came around. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4383.92s)]
*  I loved In Living Color. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4385.68s)]
*  I loved SNL too. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4386.68s)]
*  In Living Color was insane. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4387.68s)]
*  People forgot how good that was. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4388.68s)]
*  I remember I was at a pool hall the first time I saw it. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4391.400000000001s)]
*  I think it was one of those Super Bowl days where they had In Living Color on during halftime. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4394.6s)]
*  I think that was the deal. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4400.12s)]
*  Because everybody was watching In Living Color. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4402.04s)]
*  I was watching Jim Carrey's Fire Marshal Bill with his face all burned off. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4405.8s)]
*  I'm like this is insane. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4409.320000000001s)]
*  What is this? [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4410.8s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4411.8s)]
*  There was nothing like that that had ever been on television before. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4412.8s)]
*  It was on Fox. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4415.36s)]
*  Fox took more chances back then. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4416.36s)]
*  They had The Simpsons. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4418.679999999999s)]
*  They had a little wilder stuff. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4419.679999999999s)]
*  Married with children. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4421.48s)]
*  A little more racy. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4422.48s)]
*  I saw that and I was like are you out of your fucking mind? [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4425.12s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4427.719999999999s)]
*  You're mocking a bird victim? [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4428.719999999999s)]
*  I know. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4430.44s)]
*  On TV? [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4431.44s)]
*  He auditioned for SNL. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4432.44s)]
*  The show was nuts. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4433.44s)]
*  How about Handyman? [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4434.44s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4435.44s)]
*  He had a handicapped superhero. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4436.44s)]
*  Yeah with Damon Wayans. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4437.44s)]
*  Damon Wayans as Handyman was hilarious. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4438.44s)]
*  He did a movie called Handyman. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4441.28s)]
*  I forgot they did a movie. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4443.2s)]
*  Are you saying they couldn't do Handyman today? [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4446.04s)]
*  Are you saying they couldn't do Men on Film? [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4449.88s)]
*  Yeah, Men on Film was hilariously... [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4451.88s)]
*  I got to work with David Allen Greer when I did a small guest star on Gerard's show [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4457.92s)]
*  when it was on NBC, that Carmichael show. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4462.28s)]
*  And I was just so starstruck because I grew up watching. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4464.76s)]
*  But he's this thesbian guy. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4467.92s)]
*  Even before Living Color he was just this tremendous actor. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4469.72s)]
*  But he has this crazy comedy gear as well. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4472.88s)]
*  But that was so cool. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4475.64s)]
*  Oh my God! [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4476.64s)]
*  Jimmy Foxx is Wanda! [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4477.64s)]
*  Oh my God! [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4478.64s)]
*  You could never! [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4479.64s)]
*  Not in a fucking million years! [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4480.64s)]
*  Did you see him come by the store and stuff? [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4484.84s)]
*  Bro, Dave Schmell talked about this. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4485.84s)]
*  But it is a real thing. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4487.68s)]
*  Why do they in so many scripts want masculine black men to dress like women? [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4490.68s)]
*  How many times has that happened? [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4498.56s)]
*  It's a thing. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4500.2s)]
*  It's a trope, right? [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4501.2s)]
*  That's a crazy trope. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4502.8s)]
*  I don't remember who Dave was talking to. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4505.120000000001s)]
*  I forget who he was talking to when he was explaining this. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4508.120000000001s)]
*  Wasn't Cat talking about that too? [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4512.120000000001s)]
*  Can't we just rewrite it to where that's not in there? [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4514.120000000001s)]
*  Well, it's a real thing. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4517.120000000001s)]
*  How many examples are there? [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4520.120000000001s)]
*  And who's writing it? [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4523.120000000001s)]
*  You would think at this point it's such a cliché that you would censor yourself. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4525.120000000001s)]
*  Be like, okay, this is almost hack at this point. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4530.120000000001s)]
*  Like, let me not put this in here. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4532.120000000001s)]
*  It's a weird thing to ask someone to do. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4534.12s)]
*  It's a weird thing to say, hey, that guy with all the big muscles, let's put him in a dress. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4541.12s)]
*  It'll be fine. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4547.12s)]
*  Give him lipstick and give him a wig and give him high heels and call him Wanda. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4548.12s)]
*  It's got to be tough too where you go, because it's a big break for some people and you go, I don't want to do this. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4553.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4559.12s)]
*  Well, the Jamie Foxx one guaranteed was their idea because it's just a funny character. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4560.12s)]
*  It's just you couldn't do that today. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4563.12s)]
*  Right. You couldn't do that today. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4565.12s)]
*  What would that be? [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4567.12s)]
*  I'm kind of like that when it comes to like terrorist shit, you know? [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4568.12s)]
*  Because when you're a young performer and actor, sometimes the opportunities come through. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4571.12s)]
*  They go, hey, will you say Alokbar on CSI or some shit? [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4577.12s)]
*  I go, I don't know how much this helps my career. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4581.12s)]
*  Like, how am I going to level up from saying Alokbar and just like disappearing? [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4585.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4590.12s)]
*  So it's really not net positive. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4591.12s)]
*  And I'm trying to be a stand up comedian. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4593.12s)]
*  So if I was trying to be an actor, then sometimes you're stuck doing like Samuel L. Jackson had to do some parts that maybe he didn't love doing earlier. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4595.12s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4603.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4604.12s)]
*  For sure. But it's just that that particular one, getting black men to dress up like women. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4605.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4609.12s)]
*  That's a fucking weird one, man. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4611.12s)]
*  That's a real one and a weird one. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4613.12s)]
*  Like, there's so many examples of it. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4615.12s)]
*  And if you think about white men like muscular white men, how many times have muscular white men been asked to dress up like women for funny? [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4617.12s)]
*  Way less. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4625.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4626.12s)]
*  Fucking way less. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4627.12s)]
*  Way more white men in movies. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4628.12s)]
*  Way less white men wearing dresses. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4630.12s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4633.12s)]
*  You got Mrs. Doubtfire, but that's a character that he's doing. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4634.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4637.12s)]
*  That's kind of different because he's not. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4638.12s)]
*  Because he's immersed. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4639.12s)]
*  He looks like Mrs. Doubtfire. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4640.12s)]
*  Yeah, he's all in. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4641.12s)]
*  It's not a bad. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4642.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4643.12s)]
*  You don't even know that's Robin Williams under that. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4644.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4645.12s)]
*  That's the one from Toowong Fu. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4646.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4647.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4648.12s)]
*  That was like they were all drag queens. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4649.12s)]
*  John Lekwesamo. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4650.12s)]
*  But that's drag queens. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4651.12s)]
*  Okay. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4652.12s)]
*  A little different, right, because they're all drag queens. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4653.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4655.12s)]
*  So Wesley Snipes gets a pass on that one. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4656.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah, Wesley Snipes. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4658.12s)]
*  Because he's one of the drag queens. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4659.12s)]
*  Yo, I love Wesley Snipes. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4660.12s)]
*  But it was just Wesley in a dress. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4661.12s)]
*  He'd be like, what the fuck is going on with this movie? [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4662.12s)]
*  Do you think it was initially Wesley? [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4664.12s)]
*  Yes. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4667.12s)]
*  And then they said. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4668.12s)]
*  Let's surround him so it's not so obvious. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4669.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4670.12s)]
*  Let's get some friends. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4671.12s)]
*  That's how you pull it off. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4672.12s)]
*  I think that's when you get condoms at the store, but then you have a banana and then [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4673.12s)]
*  like some candy just to throw you off the scent. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4676.12s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4681.12s)]
*  Lekwesamo, man. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4682.12s)]
*  I love him. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4683.12s)]
*  He's so good. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4684.12s)]
*  He's great in John Wick. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4685.12s)]
*  Oh, he's in that? [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4686.12s)]
*  Is that the last one? [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4687.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4688.12s)]
*  No, he was in the first one. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4689.12s)]
*  He's the guy that tells John Wick who killed his dog. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4690.12s)]
*  I always think it's so funny, man. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4693.12s)]
*  That's how much Americans, just people in general, love dogs where this guy's dog gets [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4696.04s)]
*  killed and then John Wick murders like thousands of people. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4701.2s)]
*  And then everyone in the movie theater is like, yeah, that checks out. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4706.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's how it works, bro. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4708.2s)]
*  A thousand human lives for a dog. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4710.2s)]
*  You don't kill a puppy, you piece of shit. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4712.2s)]
*  It's a fucking puppy. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4713.2s)]
*  And he stole his car too, don't forget that. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4714.2s)]
*  I was trying to watch that movie with my girlfriend because I had heard it was. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4717.2s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4720.2s)]
*  Yeah, and then she's like, no, I don't want to watch it. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4721.2s)]
*  Like a puppy gets hurt. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4722.2s)]
*  I go, they don't show it. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4723.2s)]
*  It's not like the whole, like they don't show it like, you know what I mean? [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4724.2s)]
*  Also, it's just a jumping off point for the movie. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4729.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4731.24s)]
*  It's not like it's a puppy is getting worked over for two hours. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4732.24s)]
*  You know, like where are the diamonds puppy? [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4734.24s)]
*  I'll tell you when the part's over. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4739.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4741.24s)]
*  And she just didn't even like the thought that a puppy gets hurt. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4742.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4744.24s)]
*  So she mentally couldn't ever get into John Wick. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4745.24s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4748.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4749.24s)]
*  You got to get fast forward to that part. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4750.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4753.24s)]
*  I'd be like, no, the puppy lives in this version. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4754.24s)]
*  Just past the puppy part. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4756.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4758.28s)]
*  Even that wasn't enough. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4759.28s)]
*  I couldn't trick her into watching it. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4760.28s)]
*  I had to do a solo. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4761.28s)]
*  But that's like the Barbie movie for dudes. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4763.28s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4765.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4766.28s)]
*  It's basically the same thing because girls do not want to sit there and watch this handsome [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4767.28s)]
*  man assassinate 150 people. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4770.28s)]
*  But every guy does. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4773.28s)]
*  You're like, babe, wake up. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4774.28s)]
*  Come on. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4775.28s)]
*  Every guy. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4776.28s)]
*  You're missing him. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4777.28s)]
*  Dude, there's a scene where John Wick goes into the bathhouse and he's trying to kill [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4778.28s)]
*  Vigo's son. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4783.32s)]
*  And he essentially assassinates all the assassins in the bathhouse. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4785.32s)]
*  It's like one of the most intense scenes in the history of fucking action movies. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4789.32s)]
*  It's so good that when I was doing the Sober October challenge with Tom and Ari and Bert [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4794.36s)]
*  and we had a fitness challenge and I just stayed on the elliptical machine watching [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4800.8s)]
*  that scene like over and over and over again. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4804.88s)]
*  This fucking scene is intense, man. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4807.24s)]
*  The first John Wick is absolutely my favorite John Wick. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4811.44s)]
*  How many are they up to now? [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4814.44s)]
*  There's four. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4815.44s)]
*  They get a little cartoony. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4816.44s)]
*  They're still fun, but it's a different thing. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4818.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4820.44s)]
*  Well, once you get deep in the franchise, it gets cartoony. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4821.44s)]
*  Yeah, the first John Wick was the shit. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4823.44s)]
*  It was the shit. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4826.44s)]
*  Such a good movie. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4828.44s)]
*  It's just fun. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4829.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4830.44s)]
*  Yee-haw. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4831.44s)]
*  Brainless. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4832.44s)]
*  Take me away brainless for two hours. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4833.44s)]
*  Oh, there's a place for that. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4835.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4836.44s)]
*  Oppenheimer, I'm like learning all this stuff, you know. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4837.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4839.44s)]
*  Like, I feel like if they wheel, I mean, they don't wheel TVs in anymore, but when the teachers [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4840.5199999999995s)]
*  turn on Oppenheimer, you know the classes are fucking lit. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4845.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4848.5599999999995s)]
*  Because that's like educational and awesome. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4849.679999999999s)]
*  Educational awesome and today's. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4851.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4853.839999999999s)]
*  I think a lot of kids are going to get into science because of the fucking. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4854.839999999999s)]
*  That's the crazy thing about scientists, man, is that they were all like intellectual rock [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4856.919999999999s)]
*  stars. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4862.12s)]
*  They were like these wild renegade people. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4863.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4865.2s)]
*  And a lot of them did some fucking. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4866.2s)]
*  And I think that was also part of the appeal of being a great scientist is that you had [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4868.32s)]
*  like groupies, you know, just like singers. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4872.44s)]
*  Well, I've noticed that about any profession or art form form. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4875.5599999999995s)]
*  If you're a guy, you just excel in whatever field it is you are. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4880.639999999999s)]
*  There are going to be women who are attracted to that field, even if it's stamp collecting. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4883.86s)]
*  Just women are attracted to excellence and no matter how niche a thing might be. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4888.04s)]
*  Professional pool players would always bat way over the heads with girls who played pool. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4893.599999999999s)]
*  Guys who are really good pool players. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4898.28s)]
*  They always did way better with girls than they should have. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4899.96s)]
*  Even stand up. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4902.56s)]
*  Like if I didn't have stand up, I don't think I would bat. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4903.56s)]
*  If I was still an engineer at Boeing. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4905.64s)]
*  You're a handsome guy. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4907.16s)]
*  You'd find a nice girl. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4908.16s)]
*  No, but comedy comedy. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4909.16s)]
*  You'd have a family by now. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4910.16s)]
*  I would. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4911.64s)]
*  You'd have a bunch of kids and a dog. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4912.64s)]
*  I think about that. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4913.64s)]
*  Had to get the dog trained because it runs in this train. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4914.64s)]
*  Pretty much. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4916.88s)]
*  Damn it. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4917.88s)]
*  Like entertainment is such a rest of development because all that all the trappings of a traditional [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4918.88s)]
*  life are weight if you're trying to make it with a certain thing. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4923.64s)]
*  I think we hit these benchmarks later in life and it's hard. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4928.0s)]
*  Especially when you have parents who there's a certain time to be doing certain things. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4931.040000000001s)]
*  I should have a house. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4937.280000000001s)]
*  I should have a wife. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4938.64s)]
*  I should have kids. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4940.6s)]
*  I should have a dog. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4941.6s)]
*  But to do what we do is so labor intensive and hard. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4943.120000000001s)]
*  It delays your life a few years. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4947.84s)]
*  Or at least for these traditional benchmarks. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4950.040000000001s)]
*  If you're going to go down this road, it's 10 years before you're any good. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4954.8s)]
*  It's a long ass road. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4958.4400000000005s)]
*  You can get pretty good before then, but to really get say like, I think that's okay. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4960.0s)]
*  I think other people can listen to this. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4965.4800000000005s)]
*  I think other people can watch this. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4966.88s)]
*  It's like 10 years. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4968.360000000001s)]
*  And also to get some footing career wise and financially. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4969.52s)]
*  Only in the last couple of years have I felt kind of comfortable in this as a profession. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4973.88s)]
*  Because when I left Boeing, it just felt like, did I make a mistake? [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4978.84s)]
*  You can't see the other end of the shore. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4982.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4984.5199999999995s)]
*  So it's hard operating from that space of like, is this a viable career? [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4985.04s)]
*  Have I planted enough roots in the comedy game? [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4993.04s)]
*  And like things are better now. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4995.44s)]
*  If you're good and you believe you're good, you got to burn the boats. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=4997.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5001.76s)]
*  You got to burn the boats. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5002.28s)]
*  Well, I wouldn't have been doing it if I didn't believe that I had the aptitude. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5003.28s)]
*  If you have a boat to get back to your air conditioned house and eat mangoes, [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5007.72s)]
*  you're going to get back on the boat. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5013.56s)]
*  You got to burn the boat. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5015.52s)]
*  100% burn the boat. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5016.96s)]
*  And Gattaca. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5019.320000000001s)]
*  You ever watch Gattaca? [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5020.12s)]
*  It's one of my favorite movies. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5021.240000000001s)]
*  I watched a little bit of it. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5022.08s)]
*  It's so good. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5023.2s)]
*  Ethan Hawke. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5023.72s)]
*  Yes. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5024.6s)]
*  Uma Thurman. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5025.12s)]
*  I think, yes. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5025.76s)]
*  It's about genetics and stuff. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5026.96s)]
*  I was confusing it with a television show. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5028.2s)]
*  But there's this poignant scene. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5030.400000000001s)]
*  Which one am I confusing it with? [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5031.8s)]
*  Battle Star Galactica. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5032.76s)]
*  No, I watched all of that. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5033.88s)]
*  That's great too. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5034.76s)]
*  Battle Star Galactica is fucking amazing. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5035.4400000000005s)]
*  Gaius Baltar. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5036.64s)]
*  That is one of the most underrated series. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5037.84s)]
*  The second one. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5040.0s)]
*  I was watching it when it was on Syfy and they were shooting it in Vancouver. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5040.52s)]
*  The movie about CRISPR before CRISPR existed. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5043.200000000001s)]
*  Gattaca. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5045.400000000001s)]
*  That's it. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5046.12s)]
*  So good, man. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5046.6s)]
*  That's right. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5047.200000000001s)]
*  So there's two brothers. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5048.12s)]
*  One of them is genetically designed and everything. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5050.0s)]
*  He has all the gifts of technology. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5052.320000000001s)]
*  And then Ethan Hawke is like a natural baby, which is kind of a second class citizen. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5054.52s)]
*  So they're kind of shut. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5060.0s)]
*  They clean. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5061.08s)]
*  They're like janitors and stuff. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5061.72s)]
*  And there's this point in the movie where they used to race or they used to swim. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5063.44s)]
*  And the genetically superior brother would always beat the natural baby, Ethan Hawke. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5067.839999999999s)]
*  And then they kind of lose touch. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5074.08s)]
*  And at the end, they do it one last time. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5075.5199999999995s)]
*  And so Ethan Hawke is winning. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5078.879999999999s)]
*  And this isn't supposed to be happening. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5080.759999999999s)]
*  And he's like, how are you doing this? [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5082.5599999999995s)]
*  And he's like, I never saved anything for the swim back. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5084.32s)]
*  And just that quote, it just fucking hits me. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5087.48s)]
*  Oof. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5090.839999999999s)]
*  Because he's doing what's not supposed to be happening. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5092.08s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5095.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5096.16s)]
*  It's a good movie. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5097.24s)]
*  It's my favorite. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5098.0s)]
*  I mean, there's one takeaway from me doing Joe Rogenpock. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5099.24s)]
*  It's watch Gattaca. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5102.0s)]
*  One time I showed it to a girl friend and she didn't like it. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5103.92s)]
*  I don't think I've seen this whole movie. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5105.12s)]
*  I think this is one of those movies that I started and something happened and I got [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5106.76s)]
*  distracted and I stopped watching. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5109.44s)]
*  Please watch it. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5110.64s)]
*  I will. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5111.6s)]
*  I saw many of them and I can't keep up. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5112.12s)]
*  I can't keep up. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5114.48s)]
*  I did watch Oppenheimer though. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5115.72s)]
*  Fucking fascinating. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5117.8s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't know him and Einstein were boys. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5119.5199999999995s)]
*  That was cool. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5121.36s)]
*  I didn't know they talked at a pond that much. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5121.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5123.4400000000005s)]
*  I wonder how much that's legit. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5124.24s)]
*  You know, you can write a lot of- [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5125.8s)]
*  It looks good. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5126.68s)]
*  You can write a lot of nonsense into a movie after someone's dead. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5127.6s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5131.4400000000005s)]
*  And then he said, bitches ain't shit. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5131.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5137.28s)]
*  I never said that. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5137.68s)]
*  I never fucking said that. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5138.64s)]
*  I didn't say that. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5139.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, you can really, you can kind of like, pain a person. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5140.88s)]
*  For sure. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5144.56s)]
*  You know. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5145.2s)]
*  That was a thing that, a big criticism that people had from the Bruce Lee scene in, [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5146.24s)]
*  Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5151.76s)]
*  But that was obviously comedy. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5153.280000000001s)]
*  That was interesting when that- [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5155.280000000001s)]
*  Sort of. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5156.08s)]
*  Really? [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5156.72s)]
*  No. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5157.360000000001s)]
*  I read it as comedy. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5157.68s)]
*  Tarantino kind of defended it. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5158.88s)]
*  And he said that Bruce Lee was like known for being very arrogant and he said something [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5161.280000000001s)]
*  about he had beat Muhammad Ali in a fight. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5165.360000000001s)]
*  I'm like, that's crazy. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5168.24s)]
*  If he really said that, that's so insane. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5169.2s)]
*  Bruce Lee was 135 pounds. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5172.24s)]
*  Muhammad Ali at the time was 220, 225, the greatest boxer of all time. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5174.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5180.0s)]
*  Knock it out of heavyweight. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5180.959999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5182.0s)]
*  That would have been a great UFC match. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5182.32s)]
*  Especially if you're talking about him in like 1967 before they made him retire for three [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5183.839999999999s)]
*  years. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5189.839999999999s)]
*  He was insanely good. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5190.16s)]
*  Like if you want to watch how good Muhammad Ali was, watch Muhammad Ali in 1967 when he [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5191.839999999999s)]
*  fights Cleveland Big Cat Williams. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5196.879999999999s)]
*  Always tell him watch that fight because Cleveland Williams is this murderous puncher [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5198.799999999999s)]
*  and Muhammad Ali is putting on a show. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5202.879999999999s)]
*  He's dancing and moving like you can't believe. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5206.0s)]
*  No heavyweight before him. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5209.5199999999995s)]
*  Remotely moved like him. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5211.92s)]
*  It's so hard to put it in perspective now because we think about fighters now. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5214.0s)]
*  Like we've seen so many great heavyweights. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5218.56s)]
*  We've seen so many great welterweights and light heavyweights in this. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5220.64s)]
*  The world of boxing, we have so much footage. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5224.0s)]
*  But back then in 1967, there was nobody doing that. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5226.88s)]
*  Where's your footage? [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5231.5199999999995s)]
*  Where you want you? [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5232.4s)]
*  You're going to get a projecting screen and sit down. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5233.2s)]
*  If it's not on TV, you're not going to see it. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5236.08s)]
*  So you watch whatever the fuck they show you on TV and no one had ever seen a guy move [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5240.0s)]
*  like that, especially in the heavyweight division. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5245.2s)]
*  He moved like Sugar Ray Robinson, who was 147 pounder. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5247.5199999999995s)]
*  Is there anyone comparable? [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5250.96s)]
*  You would say no like that? [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5252.0s)]
*  No, there's no one that there's no one comparable in terms of like how different they were [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5253.6s)]
*  than everyone before them. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5259.04s)]
*  He was so different. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5260.8s)]
*  Can you please show me some of the Cleveland Big Cat Williams Muhammad Ali highlights? [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5262.32s)]
*  Bro, he was so different. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5267.2s)]
*  He would knock guys out moving backwards. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5268.96s)]
*  You know, he he decided when he would take it up a notch. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5271.44s)]
*  He put put different paces on you, pop the jab on you, move, make you miss a bunch of [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5275.44s)]
*  times, make you feel stupid, drop his hands, pop you again, pop you again, move around, [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5281.44s)]
*  move around. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5286.5599999999995s)]
*  You can't catch him. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5287.12s)]
*  And when you're thinking about boxing in 1967, there's no heavyweights that move like this. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5289.28s)]
*  They don't exist, man. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5296.16s)]
*  This guy is a freak. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5298.24s)]
*  So everybody before him moves like Cleveland does, you know, moving forward, looking to [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5300.16s)]
*  land the big power shots and look how big Cleveland was. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5304.88s)]
*  Jesus Christ, is he jacked? [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5307.84s)]
*  Look at the fucking arms on that guy. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5309.5199999999995s)]
*  Murderous puncher, very dangerous guy. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5311.44s)]
*  And Ali is just dancing in front of him, just shuffling and dancing. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5314.32s)]
*  Just out of range. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5319.2s)]
*  And then eventually he starts catching them, just starts tuning them up. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5320.639999999999s)]
*  Scooch ahead a little bit here. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5324.32s)]
*  So once he gets loose, he starts opening up with combinations and he moves away. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5327.44s)]
*  And Cleveland moves forward and pops him with the jab, pops him with the hook. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5332.24s)]
*  And now Cleveland's befuddled, right? [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5336.5599999999995s)]
*  Because now, you know, I can't hit this fucking guy and he can hit me anytime he wants, [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5338.32s)]
*  which is just that's not how boxing is in the heavyweight division. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5342.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5346.48s)]
*  You have big power punchers with big jabs and guys with great technique. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5347.2s)]
*  You got Joe Lewis and you know, you got Floyd Patterson. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5351.6s)]
*  You got all these different great heavyweights, but none of them fight like this fucking guy. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5354.96s)]
*  None of them fight like this guy. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5359.68s)]
*  Did they just slowly charge kind of was the style before Ali, just sort of like slow and steady? [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5360.64s)]
*  Well, everybody was just power punchers in the heavyweight division. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5364.56s)]
*  They just moved forward. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5367.6s)]
*  They would throw good jabs. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5368.64s)]
*  They had good boxing fundamentals, but they didn't move with the footwork like that. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5369.68s)]
*  That footwork was insane. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5373.6s)]
*  So if you're standing in front of them, the realization after three or four rounds of this [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5375.36s)]
*  is like, I can't take too many more of these. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5379.04s)]
*  He's not hitting me with one knockout punch, but he's hitting me 150 times in the face. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5381.44s)]
*  And he's hitting me in a way that I can't hit him back. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5386.4s)]
*  Look at this popping this jab, just moving and effortlessly. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5388.88s)]
*  He would run miles backwards. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5392.88s)]
*  There's the one, two. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5394.48s)]
*  That's it. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5395.28s)]
*  That's the beginning of it. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5395.759999999999s)]
*  He would run miles backwards, backwards, run backwards. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5396.96s)]
*  So just insane cardio, too. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5401.04s)]
*  Insane cardio, insane dedication. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5402.48s)]
*  So this is one of the most tragic from a boxing fan's perspective. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5405.36s)]
*  One of the most tragic things in boxing is that they took it away from him for three years, [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5411.12s)]
*  and he was never really this guy again. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5416.16s)]
*  This guy that you see here in 67, he stopped training. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5418.719999999999s)]
*  When he came back and fought after that, he just didn't look like the same guy. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5421.839999999999s)]
*  He wasn't the same guy physically. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5426.32s)]
*  He didn't maintain his training during those three years off. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5428.5599999999995s)]
*  Look at that, dude. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5431.92s)]
*  Look how good he was. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5433.36s)]
*  I mean, are you fucking kidding me? [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5435.04s)]
*  Are you fucking kidding me? [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5438.5599999999995s)]
*  So that was like the most revolutionary thing in boxing, like that guy in 1967. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5440.24s)]
*  Like one of the most revolutionary things ever. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5447.36s)]
*  See a heavyweight move like that. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5449.12s)]
*  And then you got Tyson in the 80s. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5451.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5453.12s)]
*  And then he was out of his prime, too, for a bit, right? [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5453.44s)]
*  Yep. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5456.24s)]
*  Yeah, but he had already... [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5457.2s)]
*  Was he saved by the bell right here? [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5458.32s)]
*  I thought this was the end of the fight. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5459.5199999999995s)]
*  No, it's not. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5460.96s)]
*  He gets up. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5461.679999999999s)]
*  Bro, they just let people fucking... [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5463.2s)]
*  They let people just be out cold. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5464.88s)]
*  Right, there's like the famous photo though, right? [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5466.96s)]
*  Were you standing over him or is that something else? [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5468.719999999999s)]
*  No, no, that's the Sonny Liston photo. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5469.92s)]
*  That's when he knocked Sonny Liston out in Lewiston, Maine, and they said it was a fixed fight. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5471.679999999999s)]
*  And it looks a little suspicious. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5476.24s)]
*  Have you ever seen that one? [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5478.5599999999995s)]
*  No. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5479.36s)]
*  Knowing that a lot of people suspect that this is a fake fight [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5481.04s)]
*  and that Liston really wasn't hurt that bad that he took a dive, watch this. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5484.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5487.5199999999995s)]
*  Because you watch like how he's trying to get up, [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5488.08s)]
*  as a person who's seen a lot of people get knocked out, [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5490.96s)]
*  I've seen probably more people get knocked out. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5493.599999999999s)]
*  Watch it. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5496.4s)]
*  Here's the right hand. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5496.72s)]
*  It's a solid right hand. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5497.36s)]
*  Absolutely legit. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5498.4s)]
*  No doubt about it. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5499.28s)]
*  But watch how Liston goes down. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5500.32s)]
*  So a lot of people said that it was a phantom punch. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5501.92s)]
*  It's not a phantom punch. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5503.68s)]
*  It's an absolute... [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5504.72s)]
*  Watch this. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5505.44s)]
*  Over the top. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5506.16s)]
*  Boom. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5506.8s)]
*  See the jaw shift? [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5507.04s)]
*  That's a real punch. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5508.16s)]
*  That's a real knockdown. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5509.36s)]
*  That's not a dive. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5510.72s)]
*  But what happens is when Liston goes down, [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5512.0s)]
*  so he throws his jab, [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5516.24s)]
*  Ali comes over the top and bang. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5517.84s)]
*  That's a 100% legit punch. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5521.12s)]
*  But when Liston goes down, that's when it gets shenanigans. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5523.12s)]
*  See if they scoot ahead to watch... [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5528.639999999999s)]
*  If they... [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5530.16s)]
*  Is this just... [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5530.88s)]
*  It's just a punch. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5531.44s)]
*  Okay. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5532.48s)]
*  Just show me the actual knockout. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5533.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5535.44s)]
*  There it is. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5536.88s)]
*  Is that it? [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5537.92s)]
*  See, you got to see when he gets up. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5540.0s)]
*  Because when he gets up, that's when it looks fake. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5542.48s)]
*  When he gets up, when he's down... [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5545.68s)]
*  No, this is like a bunch of different fights. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5550.32s)]
*  See if you can find it. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5553.52s)]
*  Did you box or you're always doing... [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5555.04s)]
*  I did some kickboxing. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5557.04s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5558.4800000000005s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5558.8s)]
*  Right here. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5559.2s)]
*  So he hits him. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5560.72s)]
*  He knocks him down. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5562.400000000001s)]
*  Now watch. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5563.2s)]
*  Watch. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5564.0s)]
*  He goes down. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5564.32s)]
*  Now this is where it gets a little shenanigan-y. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5565.52s)]
*  See, I'm watching him roll around. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5570.0s)]
*  He gets to his knees. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5572.32s)]
*  And he falls back down again. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5574.08s)]
*  It just looks a little like he's not trying to stop himself from going to his back. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5575.28s)]
*  It looks a little funky. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5580.4s)]
*  It looks a little funky. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5582.72s)]
*  So like he gets up and look, he's looking away. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5584.5599999999995s)]
*  He's not even looking at Ali. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5587.2s)]
*  So they're not deciding yet whether or not the fight is stopped. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5589.2s)]
*  And now Ali is fucking teeing off on him. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5592.4s)]
*  And then they stop the fight. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5597.44s)]
*  It was very shenanigan-y. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5600.24s)]
*  You know? [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5602.5599999999995s)]
*  It looked a little shenanigan-y. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5603.68s)]
*  He made contact though. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5605.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5606.32s)]
*  But it's also like the humiliation that Liston suffered from the first fight. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5606.88s)]
*  The first fight was 100% legit. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5610.88s)]
*  The first fight when he fought Sonny Liston. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5613.52s)]
*  Sonny Liston was this murderous puncher, man. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5615.28s)]
*  He was one of the most murderous punchers ever. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5617.68s)]
*  He fucked up Floyd Patterson so bad. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5620.08s)]
*  He was so dangerous. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5622.08s)]
*  He was so scary. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5623.28s)]
*  And he was a thug. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5624.96s)]
*  Like he was a crazy dude. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5626.24s)]
*  Like during one of the press conferences. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5627.28s)]
*  See if you can find this. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5629.04s)]
*  Ali was talking crazy shit. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5630.8s)]
*  Liston pulled out a fucking gun. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5632.0s)]
*  He pulled out a gun and shot through the fucking ceiling. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5633.92s)]
*  Are these people being... [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5637.28s)]
*  Everybody scrambled. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5638.0s)]
*  Are they legit nutty like that? [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5639.28s)]
*  Or is this partly PR for the fight? [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5640.64s)]
*  Like if I shoot a gun this will draw eyeballs. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5642.4s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5644.56s)]
*  That was who Sonny Liston was. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5645.44s)]
*  And what Muhammad Ali was doing was trying to get into his head. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5647.36s)]
*  Shoot its blanks. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5652.4s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5660.48s)]
*  Sonny Liston came to a head when Clay approached Liston at the Desert Inn in Las Vegas where the champ was shooting craps and losing. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5662.0s)]
*  Liston was in no mood to be harangued by the mouth from the south. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5668.56s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5673.52s)]
*  He was set on fire, frightening his young tormentor into a hasty retreat. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5674.56s)]
*  The gun was filled with blanks. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5678.56s)]
*  Yo. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5681.92s)]
*  He just put it in his coat pocket to prove it's a blank. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5683.92s)]
*  I'd be terrified, dude. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5687.44s)]
*  By the way, those kids still kill you. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5688.48s)]
*  People that put blanks up to their head, the force of the gas coming out of the barrel of the gun can kill you. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5691.2s)]
*  And it has killed people. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5697.36s)]
*  A guy did it on a set once. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5698.64s)]
*  He was just fucking around with a blank. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5700.8s)]
*  They have so much protocol whenever there's a gun on set. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5703.84s)]
*  Bro, that's so scary. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5705.44s)]
*  Move quick. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5707.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, look how fast his fucking reflexes were. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5708.88s)]
*  He dodged a bullet. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5711.2s)]
*  Legitimately. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5712.8s)]
*  He's talking shit. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5713.5199999999995s)]
*  He dodged fast. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5714.32s)]
*  Bro, but he would constantly talk shit at every press conference. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5715.6s)]
*  It got so bad to the point where when they did his like the weigh-in thing, [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5719.84s)]
*  like after the weigh-in, his heart rate was so high, his blood pressure was so high, [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5724.96s)]
*  that they had to calm him down or they weren't going to let him fight. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5729.2s)]
*  Because he just like worked himself up into a frenzy to fuck with Liston. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5732.0s)]
*  He would show up in front of Liston's house and yell on his front lawn. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5736.24s)]
*  Like he climbed into that dude's head. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5740.8s)]
*  Oh, I'm sure. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5743.76s)]
*  How crazy to be that gifted as a fighter and that gifted as a shit talker as well. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5744.64s)]
*  Unprecedented shit talker. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5749.04s)]
*  No one before him did poetry. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5750.72s)]
*  No one did rhymes. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5753.44s)]
*  Like you don't understand. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5755.12s)]
*  He did his work to get inside that. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5756.0s)]
*  My parents were hippies and they had to watch [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5757.92s)]
*  when Muhammad Ali was rematching Leon Spinks because on television. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5761.84s)]
*  That's how much of like a cultural icon that guy was. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5767.5199999999995s)]
*  Because he stood against the Vietnam War and that's why he lost three years of his career [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5771.12s)]
*  when he was in his prime. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5776.24s)]
*  In 1967, he's like, I'm not going to Vietnam. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5777.6s)]
*  He goes, no, Viet Cong ever did shit to me. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5780.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm not doing this. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5783.04s)]
*  And they took away his ability to box for three years. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5784.64s)]
*  And, you know, my parents are like very anti-war. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5788.8s)]
*  They were like, this is our guy. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5792.0s)]
*  Like the whole country was like this. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5794.72s)]
*  This is a person who represented sense. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5796.96s)]
*  He made sense when the world was going crazy [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5799.68s)]
*  and they were talking people into fighting this nonsense war in Vietnam. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5802.88s)]
*  And you could possibly lose your life or lose a leg or lose a friend [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5807.6s)]
*  or lose your father or lose your what? [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5811.04s)]
*  And he was like, fuck that. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5814.72s)]
*  And he was right. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5816.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5817.6s)]
*  It was one of those things that it took years to get clarity on it [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5817.92s)]
*  as a collective whole society. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5821.120000000001s)]
*  Whereas at the time, he's probably raked over the coals, right? [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5822.400000000001s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5824.96s)]
*  There's a lot of people that didn't look weird. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5825.84s)]
*  We had associated wars before Vietnam with these just wars, [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5829.4400000000005s)]
*  like World War One and World War Two. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5833.6s)]
*  We thought of those as just wars, like you're trying to stop evil. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5835.84s)]
*  There's a guy who's hopped up on meth in Germany [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5839.2s)]
*  and he literally, literally hopped up on meth. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5841.84s)]
*  That was a simple one. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5843.76s)]
*  Try to take over the world. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5844.400000000001s)]
*  That's a simple one. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5845.6s)]
*  These are just wars, right? [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5846.4800000000005s)]
*  By the way, they're not simple. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5848.400000000001s)]
*  They're super complicated. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5849.84s)]
*  And there's a lot of... [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5851.28s)]
*  In terms of cartoony bad guys. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5852.4800000000005s)]
*  Bad guy, good guy. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5854.08s)]
*  We're the good guys. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5855.12s)]
*  And we like to think of ourselves like that. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5856.08s)]
*  So when we're at war, if we're at war to stop communism in Vietnam, [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5857.84s)]
*  we, at the time, I think collectively, there was a lot of like hardcore [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5862.72s)]
*  fucking blue collar Republican type people that were like, [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5867.6s)]
*  yeah, you got to do what the fuck you have to do to protect freedom. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5871.68s)]
*  Right? [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5875.04s)]
*  And you got... [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5875.6s)]
*  But then they didn't know that the whole thing was staged. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5876.0s)]
*  They didn't know that that Gulf of Tonkin incident was a false flag [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5878.4800000000005s)]
*  just to justify us getting into that crazy ass war for who knows what reason. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5882.24s)]
*  But there's a lot of them, a lot of reasons. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5887.28s)]
*  So now people have a different sort of feeling. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5889.2s)]
*  When it comes to war. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5892.0s)]
*  So you think that was the first time people became... [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5893.36s)]
*  At this point, I would like to play [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5894.16s)]
*  Fuck A War by the Ghetto Boys. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5895.92s)]
*  But Spotify will allow this. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5898.56s)]
*  And do you know that song? [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5902.32s)]
*  Maybe if I heard it. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5905.76s)]
*  Bro, give me a little bit of this. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5906.8s)]
*  Willie wrote that in 45 minutes. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5908.56s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5910.72s)]
*  How do you write that in 45? [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5911.6s)]
*  It's a fucking great song, man. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5912.56s)]
*  It's a great song. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5913.68s)]
*  And it's so... [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5914.4s)]
*  It's right. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5915.4400000000005s)]
*  He's right. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5916.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5917.04s)]
*  He's right. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5917.36s)]
*  And, you know... [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5918.16s)]
*  It's interesting to see the evolution of rap, you know? [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5919.28s)]
*  When it started, it was very socially conscious and stuff. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5922.160000000001s)]
*  I know they're still doing that. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5924.8s)]
*  But in terms of what becomes popular on a pop scale for rap... [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5927.280000000001s)]
*  Do you know Russ at all? [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5931.92s)]
*  It's interesting hearing him talk about it. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5932.88s)]
*  He's this hip hop artist who's independent. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5934.240000000001s)]
*  He was on Flagrant talking about rap. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5937.200000000001s)]
*  And what happens is a certain type of rap gets popular. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5940.160000000001s)]
*  And then it becomes uncool. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5943.6s)]
*  You move to the next thing. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5945.6s)]
*  Like being socially conscious is cool. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5946.96s)]
*  And then just having fun and whiling out is cool. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5948.72s)]
*  And then what's the next phase? [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5951.2s)]
*  So it's not like it doesn't exist. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5953.679999999999s)]
*  It just becomes a smaller piece of the larger genre pie. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5955.36s)]
*  And now rap is so big, there's subgenres of it like rock. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5959.36s)]
*  There's indie rock. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5962.96s)]
*  And now there's emo rap. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5964.08s)]
*  Well, there always kind of was different genres. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5965.599999999999s)]
*  Even back in the day, I was always a big De La Soul fan. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5968.4s)]
*  Yeah, same. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5971.2s)]
*  Three's the magic number. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5971.84s)]
*  That's a jam, son. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5972.96s)]
*  That's a jam. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5974.4s)]
*  And that was very different. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5975.36s)]
*  Very different kind of hip hop. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5977.36s)]
*  But now it's getting so granular. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5979.04s)]
*  Even more so. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5980.8s)]
*  So that's just kind of interesting. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5983.84s)]
*  I was like, oh yeah. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5984.96s)]
*  Did you start this like a social? [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5986.400000000001s)]
*  Remember Third Base? [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5987.360000000001s)]
*  How did Third Base, were they white guys? [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5988.16s)]
*  Pop goes the weasel because the weasel goes pop. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5989.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they're white guys. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5992.88s)]
*  You don't remember that? [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5993.68s)]
*  Did one of the flat top? [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5994.4800000000005s)]
*  They had like a diss track against Vanilla Ice. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5995.6s)]
*  Yeah, I like that battle. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=5999.84s)]
*  That's fun. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6000.72s)]
*  Pop goes the weasel. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6001.2s)]
*  And Vanilla is the weasel? [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6003.360000000001s)]
*  It's people that go pop. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6004.96s)]
*  They were hardcore. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6006.72s)]
*  Third Base. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6008.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6009.28s)]
*  Oh, Yannis was talking about this. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6009.44s)]
*  What's interesting is that dude eventually went on to host a daytime talk show. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6010.879999999999s)]
*  What was it about? [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6015.759999999999s)]
*  Which is like the poppiest thing of all time. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6016.24s)]
*  Like a Ricky Lake type thing? [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6017.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like one of them things. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6019.04s)]
*  Did he have the flat top? [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6020.96s)]
*  I believe he kept the flat top when he hosted his show. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6022.24s)]
*  That's impressive though. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6024.48s)]
*  That's an impressive flat top. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6025.28s)]
*  It's a serious flat top. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6026.24s)]
*  I don't even know how you get that going on as a white guy. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6027.919999999999s)]
*  There must be some products involved. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6032.0s)]
*  MC Search. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6034.4s)]
*  MC Search. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6035.5199999999995s)]
*  They're good though, man. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6036.48s)]
*  Third Base was good. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6037.36s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6038.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6039.280000000001s)]
*  They had some great jams and MC Search had a great album himself too. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6039.84s)]
*  It was great. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6043.76s)]
*  They were good but for whatever reason, the white guy rapper, there's only one. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6044.8s)]
*  The big one. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6050.8s)]
*  Eminem. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6051.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6052.240000000001s)]
*  There's other ones. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6053.12s)]
*  There's other great white rappers. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6054.400000000001s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6055.92s)]
*  He had to be so technically proficient and it's amazing what he had to do to be able to be accepted. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6057.68s)]
*  He needed the vouch. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6063.12s)]
*  He needed to have the skill set that he has. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6064.240000000001s)]
*  Before him, I think young people don't realize, that's what's kind of cool about the younger [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6067.28s)]
*  generation like Gen Z and stuff is they just like art. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6070.959999999999s)]
*  They don't care what your vessel is. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6074.5599999999995s)]
*  There's a rapper, Rich Brian. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6076.719999999999s)]
*  He's Asian and he's great at rapping but he's an Asian kid. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6078.24s)]
*  Whereas before, you weren't able to receive music from a vessel that looks different than [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6082.879999999999s)]
*  what the norm is. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6088.32s)]
*  And then there was my man, Everlast, House of Pain. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6090.48s)]
*  That was the best of the white rap bands by far. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6095.76s)]
*  House of Pain was awesome. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6099.84s)]
*  Dude, jump around to this day. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6102.0s)]
*  When that song comes out for the UFC, when someone comes out as that song for a walking [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6104.64s)]
*  song, that is a great fucking walking song. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6109.04s)]
*  That's a great I'm in the gym song. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6112.08s)]
*  That's a great driving song. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6115.2s)]
*  That's a let's fucking go song. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6117.36s)]
*  That's a let's fucking go song. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6119.84s)]
*  Oh, just hearing those. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6122.56s)]
*  You know what it is immediately. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6124.0s)]
*  Man. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6125.12s)]
*  And then that's it. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6127.84s)]
*  That's all we get. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6129.2s)]
*  That's all we get. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6129.84s)]
*  God damn it. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6130.72s)]
*  YouTube. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6131.28s)]
*  This is the beautiful freedom that we have on Spotify. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6132.96s)]
*  I think we're going to start doing that, Jamie. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6136.32s)]
*  I'm not going to just Spotify exclusive. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6138.16s)]
*  Yeah, just have little clips. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6140.08s)]
*  Cut it out for YouTube. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6141.4400000000005s)]
*  People know. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6142.56s)]
*  Yeah, we'll know. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6143.36s)]
*  We'll put the full one out on Spotify. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6144.32s)]
*  The vibe corner. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6146.08s)]
*  God damn these rules. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6147.12s)]
*  So what is fucking rules? [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6149.2s)]
*  How is the new deal different than like what you're able to? [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6150.56s)]
*  The mass talk is the new deal. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6153.12s)]
*  It's a big part of it. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6154.5599999999995s)]
*  That makes sense. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6156.24s)]
*  That makes sense. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6156.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6157.5199999999995s)]
*  After the election cycle, then. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6158.08s)]
*  Yeah, then I can discuss the bombings. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6159.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6162.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's just going to be everywhere now. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6163.599999999999s)]
*  Well, it's going to be on Apple, Amazon, and YouTube as well as on Spotify. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6166.48s)]
*  That's pretty great. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6172.0s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6172.96s)]
*  It's cool. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6173.5199999999995s)]
*  So it's kind of like the way it was before the move to Spotify. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6174.0s)]
*  Like you're getting pretty much. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6176.48s)]
*  Yeah, pretty much. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6178.5599999999995s)]
*  But my deal is with Spotify. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6179.36s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6181.44s)]
*  So Spotify and our. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6181.68s)]
*  Instead of. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6183.68s)]
*  You know, they have a vested interest in it being successful everywhere. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6185.68s)]
*  So we're all in it together. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6190.96s)]
*  Oh, is that the thought like, okay, we're drawing people in via Apple podcast, [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6192.240000000001s)]
*  these different YouTube. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6197.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6198.56s)]
*  Just to draw us back. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6198.8s)]
*  They'll make money off of it being on the other shows too. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6199.52s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6202.320000000001s)]
*  It's all good. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6202.8s)]
*  It's good for everybody. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6203.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6204.64s)]
*  It's good. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6205.04s)]
*  And it's wider distribution is good. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6205.84s)]
*  And it's just like, look, people get attached to certain platforms. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6208.08s)]
*  Some people are super attached to Apple and I used to be as well. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6212.24s)]
*  I used to get all my podcasts on Apple. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6215.76s)]
*  It was super convenient. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6217.92s)]
*  It uploads automatically. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6219.68s)]
*  You know, you can set it like that. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6221.28s)]
*  So, you know, when the new episodes are up, it's perfect. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6222.96s)]
*  Works great. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6225.12s)]
*  So I get if they didn't want to switch over and listen to Spotify. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6227.12s)]
*  I mean, I knew that when we first started doing it, I was like, a lot of people are [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6230.48s)]
*  going to be like, sorry, there's a lot of shit to listen to, which is great. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6233.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6236.96s)]
*  It's fucking great time if you're interested in listening to stuff. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6237.2s)]
*  I mean, the amount of audiobooks available are fucking insane. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6241.12s)]
*  It's insane. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6245.04s)]
*  You could never go board. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6246.4s)]
*  You will always get entertained or educated or something. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6248.0s)]
*  There's so many of them. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6251.44s)]
*  But the amount of podcasts now are it's bonkers. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6253.5199999999995s)]
*  There's like five million podcasts. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6258.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6261.12s)]
*  I remember years ago talking to Ari at the store. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6261.36s)]
*  This is maybe like when podcasting was 2.0 or I'm like, everyone has a podcast. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6264.64s)]
*  And he's like, everyone has a TV show. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6269.360000000001s)]
*  They don't stop making TV shows. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6271.2s)]
*  And that was really eye opening to me, too. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6272.88s)]
*  Like, just because there's a lot of them doesn't mean there's no place for new ones. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6274.56s)]
*  It's wrong. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6279.12s)]
*  I used to tell so many people to do a podcast that it was a meme that was annoying. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6279.76s)]
*  I was telling everyone to do a podcast. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6284.56s)]
*  I wasn't right. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6286.64s)]
*  I want to apologize to society. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6290.400000000001s)]
*  I fucked up a couple of times. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6292.0s)]
*  But I felt like, and I do feel like, I don't think it's the easiest road. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6294.08s)]
*  But I think if you're a person who's interesting to talk to, [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6299.28s)]
*  you could find other people that are also interesting to talk to and sit down and people enjoy it. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6302.4800000000005s)]
*  It's like you can do it. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6308.08s)]
*  But it's going to take some work. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6309.92s)]
*  So if you dedicate yourself to it and try to figure out what you're doing wrong, [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6311.52s)]
*  what you're doing right, what makes you annoying, what's more interesting. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6314.96s)]
*  If you do it right, treat it like any other thing, you'll get better at it. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6318.8s)]
*  But it's not going to come easy. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6323.04s)]
*  There's too many of them out there. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6324.64s)]
*  But it does. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6326.32s)]
*  It's free. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6327.04s)]
*  It's free. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6328.08s)]
*  You could just do it. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6328.8s)]
*  You could just upload it to YouTube. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6329.76s)]
*  It doesn't cost that much to put together. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6331.2s)]
*  It's not like you're filming a sitcom and it costs so much a soundstage. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6333.92s)]
*  The overhead is so low to do a podcast. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6337.5199999999995s)]
*  So it's worth the trial of doing it. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6339.6s)]
*  And also, I think just in the stand-up space, it's a great two-hander because [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6342.4s)]
*  you don't always put a special out all the time. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6347.44s)]
*  And being able to check in with your fans week to week, they like that. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6349.28s)]
*  Just being a part of your life and stuff. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6353.44s)]
*  And then they kind of want to know what your baseline is offstage as well. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6355.12s)]
*  Because then they feel closer to you as a performer. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6358.56s)]
*  You know? [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6361.04s)]
*  Like Access is the new mystery, I feel like, in entertainment. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6361.76s)]
*  Whereas before, it was like, oh, Humphrey Bogart or these starlets. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6364.8s)]
*  You only got glimpses of what they were. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6368.4s)]
*  But now that's almost like a kiss of death. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6370.88s)]
*  You have to be like, hey, guys, here I am. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6372.72s)]
*  I'm at Whole Foods. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6375.76s)]
*  I'm getting like Access. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6376.96s)]
*  They want to feel like, oh, I know them. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6378.4800000000005s)]
*  You know? [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6380.88s)]
*  That's valuable. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6381.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6381.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6382.4s)]
*  The only guy who doesn't have to play that game anymore is like Daniel Day-Lewis. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6382.96s)]
*  He can make shoes. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6386.879999999999s)]
*  Like no one's telling Daniel Day-Lewis to live tweet his movie. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6388.799999999999s)]
*  Well, there's certain actors that are on the fringes, right? [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6391.5199999999995s)]
*  Not on the fringes, meaning like everybody knows who they are. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6394.0s)]
*  But they might not be the first pick for a big project. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6397.36s)]
*  Right? [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6401.44s)]
*  And the only way they think they can keep their name out there is to do stuff. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6401.759999999999s)]
*  So they have to get photographed on red carpets. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6405.679999999999s)]
*  And they have to sometimes tell the paparazzi where they're going to be. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6408.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6411.92s)]
*  They have publicists that set things up so you can casually see them doing something, [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6413.12s)]
*  you know, like fucking intimate, like working out on the beach. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6418.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6420.88s)]
*  You know, some shit like that. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6421.12s)]
*  I thought you guys were here. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6421.84s)]
*  How crazy. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6423.5199999999995s)]
*  I look great. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6424.0s)]
*  I'm oiled up. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6424.5599999999995s)]
*  What are the odds? [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6426.72s)]
*  Yeah, there's some silliness to it. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6427.599999999999s)]
*  But I get it. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6429.28s)]
*  It's a business. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6430.32s)]
*  Your business is you, and this is a business decision that you're making. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6432.0s)]
*  I get it. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6435.2s)]
*  But it's just like that's a different thing than comics. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6436.16s)]
*  You know, with us, the best thing that we have going on is like this network of all of us. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6439.120000000001s)]
*  That's the best thing we have going on. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6446.400000000001s)]
*  Because now instead of relying on like Comedy Central to tell you who's good or... [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6448.240000000001s)]
*  It's a total meritocracy. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6453.280000000001s)]
*  And it's almost always entirely based on are you funny and are you fun? [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6455.360000000001s)]
*  Are you fun to hang around with? [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6459.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6460.080000000001s)]
*  And if you're funny and fun to hang around with, yay, we're all going to have fun. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6460.400000000001s)]
*  And that's great for everybody. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6464.8s)]
*  It's awesome, man. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6466.320000000001s)]
*  People that are listening. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6466.88s)]
*  It's great for us. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6468.08s)]
*  I'm so fortunate. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6469.2s)]
*  It's great to see the art form popping. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6469.68s)]
*  That it's shifted this way. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6471.76s)]
*  And now this is like a viable release route for me. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6473.36s)]
*  Like I have the special coming out. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6476.72s)]
*  I get to do this. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6478.4800000000005s)]
*  I get to do Bad Friends. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6479.4400000000005s)]
*  You don't have to be chosen. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6480.56s)]
*  You don't have to be chosen. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6481.76s)]
*  And also like who better than other comedians to know what's what in the field? [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6482.72s)]
*  We don't have any agenda. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6488.08s)]
*  We're in the streets. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6490.08s)]
*  We see what's going on. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6490.88s)]
*  Whereas sometimes you get so high up at these corporations. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6492.16s)]
*  They just they're like, okay, we need this demo. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6494.56s)]
*  We need this person. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6496.96s)]
*  This guy's from this agency. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6497.92s)]
*  That's a favor. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6499.04s)]
*  There's all this fuckery. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6500.0s)]
*  A lot of fuckery. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6501.28s)]
*  There's so much fuckery. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6502.0s)]
*  They should not be in control of this art form. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6502.72s)]
*  It's not their art form. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6505.12s)]
*  It's our art form. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6506.4800000000005s)]
*  It's the audience's art form. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6507.52s)]
*  You're seeing the cracks now. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6508.88s)]
*  It's crumbling. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6510.08s)]
*  I mean, I have no management now. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6510.72s)]
*  Like I like it that way. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6512.56s)]
*  I just have an agency. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6513.4400000000005s)]
*  And I'm getting approached sometimes. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6514.400000000001s)]
*  But like we're at a point in entertainment and culture and stuff where like what value [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6517.2s)]
*  does like a 90s type manager have anymore? [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6522.64s)]
*  Because it's like the blueprint is different now. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6525.36s)]
*  Like these Hollywood opportunities don't help me as a stand-up comedian anymore. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6528.799999999999s)]
*  It depends on what kind of a manager you have. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6533.12s)]
*  So if you have a really good manager, a really good manager is very beneficial [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6535.599999999999s)]
*  because they can strategize with you about what you do and what the pros and cons of [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6540.639999999999s)]
*  what you do are and what's the best business decision and how do you feel artistically [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6545.92s)]
*  about your set now? [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6552.799999999999s)]
*  Have we thought about holding off for six months? [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6554.400000000001s)]
*  You have people that are confident. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6556.24s)]
*  Yeah, there's value in that if you find the right person and they're keyed into what you're [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6557.52s)]
*  doing. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6561.92s)]
*  But sometimes you go places. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6562.24s)]
*  You're just part of a roster. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6563.52s)]
*  Yes. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6565.04s)]
*  Like they're just... [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6565.28s)]
*  There's a problem in the same thing. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6566.64s)]
*  It's like factory farming. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6568.32s)]
*  They're factory farming comedy. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6569.360000000001s)]
*  They try to get as many comics as they can. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6570.56s)]
*  They're collecting you. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6572.24s)]
*  They're collecting you and hoping you pop. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6573.28s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6575.04s)]
*  And then they just siphon off some 10%. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6575.6s)]
*  But when you're a young comic and you're coming up, the idea of being in a management company [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6578.24s)]
*  is a fucking huge deal. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6582.96s)]
*  And it is an opportunity too because they can get you some things that you're not going [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6584.8s)]
*  to get without it. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6588.16s)]
*  For sure. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6588.72s)]
*  Also, you have to... [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6589.28s)]
*  They'll get you booked at improvs. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6589.68s)]
*  They'll get you some good gigs. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6590.88s)]
*  So also where you are in your career, like I'm deep. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6592.24s)]
*  I have a lot of connections. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6596.0s)]
*  You're deep, bro. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6597.28s)]
*  I'm deep, dude. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6597.84s)]
*  I know you. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6598.56s)]
*  You are deep. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6599.12s)]
*  I'm texting you. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6599.76s)]
*  You should write that. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6600.4800000000005s)]
*  That should be a new special. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6601.44s)]
*  I'm deep, bro. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6602.4s)]
*  I'm deep, bro. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6603.04s)]
*  LanceKad, stop us. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6603.52s)]
*  I'm deep, bro. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6605.36s)]
*  That's it. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6606.4800000000005s)]
*  We're making this happen. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6607.04s)]
*  I'm deep, bro. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6608.08s)]
*  I'm deep, bro. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6609.04s)]
*  The bro instantly negates the I'm deep is what I love. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6610.24s)]
*  He does it, though. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6614.08s)]
*  I mean, Elon Musk can say it. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6615.92s)]
*  Yeah, people believe him, though. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6618.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, but you know what I'm saying? [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=6619.92s)]

*  Red Bull has that. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7249.4400000000005s)]
*  That is the shit. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7250.56s)]
*  How is it different than like what I got? [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7251.200000000001s)]
*  It's just bigger, more battery, more features, a larger screen. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7253.04s)]
*  It's a little bit more like I'm a robot. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7256.64s)]
*  This is so dumb, but like the biggest feature I use on this watch is like when I'm cooking [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7259.12s)]
*  and I'm like set timer for two minutes. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7262.320000000001s)]
*  Like I'm Dick Tracy. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7264.96s)]
*  Right. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7266.240000000001s)]
*  I use it for laundry. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7266.88s)]
*  I just use it as a timer. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7268.0s)]
*  That's like the big sell to me. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7269.12s)]
*  Well, you know, Red Band is like a giant tech. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7270.56s)]
*  I imagine he's on an Apple vision right now. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7272.88s)]
*  Most likely. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7274.96s)]
*  The most earliest adopter. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7275.68s)]
*  He has a Neuralink right now, I'm sure. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7276.8s)]
*  He'll get that for sure. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7278.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7280.8s)]
*  He'll be the first to try it out. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7282.08s)]
*  He's like, he's like, it's got some kinks. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7284.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's bleeding. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7287.84s)]
*  I should have waited. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7288.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7289.6s)]
*  I should have waited till they're going to fix it. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7290.080000000001s)]
*  I'm giving some notes to Elon, but it's good. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7292.080000000001s)]
*  I'm glad I did it. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7294.160000000001s)]
*  If you do get it, you will have such an advantage. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7294.88s)]
*  That's the problem. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7297.52s)]
*  If it does work, the thing is like if it works and what are the side effects and how long [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7298.400000000001s)]
*  does it last? [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7302.4800000000005s)]
*  What if it breaks? [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7302.96s)]
*  What if Russia hacks it? [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7303.92s)]
*  You're speaking Russian. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7306.080000000001s)]
*  What if they hack it? [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7307.200000000001s)]
*  What if like the moment it gets to a certain number of people that have it, China flips [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7308.4800000000005s)]
*  the switch? [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7313.12s)]
*  I mean, just something being in your brain is such a big cell, right? [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7313.68s)]
*  Like it's not a hard cell. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7318.48s)]
*  It's a hard cell. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7319.5199999999995s)]
*  That's a fucking hard cell. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7320.48s)]
*  But then there's toxoplasmosis, which is in there for 40% of us. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7321.76s)]
*  What is plasmosis? [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7325.04s)]
*  That stuff we talked about earlier, the cat thing. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7326.08s)]
*  Ah. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7328.0s)]
*  Toxo. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7328.5599999999995s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7329.68s)]
*  You just willingly get, willingly get toxo? [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7330.24s)]
*  Yeah, maybe the cell phone thing will be like a neurological electronic toxo. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7332.4s)]
*  What is the promise of Neuralink? [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7338.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, initially, the first person that they did it on, which is fairly recently, [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7341.04s)]
*  is a person who's paralyzed and through Neuralink, he can now move a cursor around [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7346.4s)]
*  and he can do things and he's going to be able to like express himself. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7352.24s)]
*  The way Elon said, at the speed of a carnival barker. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7357.04s)]
*  Wow. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7360.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7360.96s)]
*  Those guys are fast. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7361.84s)]
*  They're fast. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7362.719999999999s)]
*  Very fast, very fast. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7363.12s)]
*  So the idea is that he'll be able to communicate, which is for a person who's been paralyzed [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7364.799999999999s)]
*  and can't operate a cursor, a computer is huge. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7369.44s)]
*  So that's one thing. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7373.36s)]
*  Eventually think they may be able to use it to let people who have been paralyzed move. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7375.759999999999s)]
*  Like a walk again? [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7383.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7384.48s)]
*  What is the work that's been done on that specifically, Jamie? [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7385.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't want to talk out of school. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7388.639999999999s)]
*  The people being able to eventually, they hope that it'd be able to restore movement [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7390.639999999999s)]
*  to people with nerve damage. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7395.44s)]
*  Right now, I think there's still, when I've looked this up online, [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7397.44s)]
*  there's a little bit of a pushback from some people. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7400.5599999999995s)]
*  Of course. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7403.759999999999s)]
*  Because the only way that this has been announced that it works is just Elon's tweet. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7403.919999999999s)]
*  There hasn't been any other proof, I guess, if you will. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7406.879999999999s)]
*  I'm all in. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7410.639999999999s)]
*  If Elon tweeted it, it's got to be legit. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7412.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7414.08s)]
*  He's a wild boy. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7416.48s)]
*  He's so wild. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7417.919999999999s)]
*  He just tweets things. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7419.04s)]
*  Does he come by the club a lot? [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7420.24s)]
*  He's been to the club. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7421.5199999999995s)]
*  Has he been to the club? [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7422.639999999999s)]
*  I imagine he's so busy. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7423.36s)]
*  He's been to a lot of the stuff shows. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7424.32s)]
*  Hanging there every day. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7425.5199999999995s)]
*  No, I don't think he has been. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7426.64s)]
*  He might have came down when Dave was here. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7428.160000000001s)]
*  It's awesome having him around. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7433.04s)]
*  He's a fascinating dude. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7434.64s)]
*  How exciting for the comics. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7436.0s)]
*  Like, yo, Elon's here. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7437.12s)]
*  Well, he came to a bunch of our shows when we had stubs. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7438.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, cool. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7440.8s)]
*  It's like that was when there was nothing to do. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7443.52s)]
*  Well, I got to do one of those stubs shows. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7445.6s)]
*  Those were so fun. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7447.280000000001s)]
*  When I had that writing job, it was like Willy Wonka. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7448.08s)]
*  You're like, hey, I'm doing a show with me and Chappelle at Stubbs. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7450.08s)]
*  I'm literally writing a sitcom. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7454.0s)]
*  I'm in a writer's room and it's kind of boring. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7455.92s)]
*  To get this awesome call to the bullpen, like, yo, do you want to come? [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7458.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, let me ask them real quick. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7463.6s)]
*  I go, and I still have to add, I'm like, hey, guys, I might do a show with Joe Rogan [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7464.72s)]
*  and Dave Chappelle later tonight. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7469.68s)]
*  Can I leave 30 minutes early? [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7471.28s)]
*  And they're so cool. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7473.36s)]
*  They're like, yeah, yeah, go. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7474.24s)]
*  It's like a rom-com. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7475.2s)]
*  They're like, well, what are you doing? [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7475.92s)]
*  Go after her. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7477.12s)]
*  Because this is very cool for them. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7480.88s)]
*  I'm very fortunate. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7484.16s)]
*  They're very supportive and stuff. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7485.04s)]
*  And stand-up is kind of like rock star-y. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7486.24s)]
*  And they were very cool. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7488.0s)]
*  Yeah, please take the, leave 30 minutes early, do the show, tell us how it is. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7489.2s)]
*  So envious, have fun. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7494.72s)]
*  And then you pick me up in your fucking muscle car. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7496.72s)]
*  I picked you up in the 70s Chappelle. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7499.2s)]
*  It keeps getting better and better and better. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7500.24s)]
*  It gets more absurd. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7502.64s)]
*  I told you I was going to pick you up in the coolest car you've ever seen in your life. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7503.5199999999995s)]
*  You'll hear it coming. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7506.48s)]
*  And literally you show up. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7508.24s)]
*  I hear, it smells like a boat. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7509.68s)]
*  That thing's America. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7513.28s)]
*  And then Chappelle, you showed him the car. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7514.719999999999s)]
*  I remember after the show. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7516.719999999999s)]
*  And he's just floored. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7518.4s)]
*  He's like, oh, let me check this thing out. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7520.16s)]
*  And he was loving the car. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7523.759999999999s)]
*  And then we drove to the after party. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7525.28s)]
*  This was just such a surreal night for me. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7527.92s)]
*  Because we do the show. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7531.28s)]
*  It's amazing. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7532.32s)]
*  It's an alternate universe where comedy is happening and it's not happening in LA. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7533.12s)]
*  The show's amazing. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7537.2s)]
*  It's fun. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7538.0s)]
*  And then I'm just laying in the cut. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7538.799999999999s)]
*  I don't want to overextend. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7542.32s)]
*  I'm just so grateful to be asked to do the show. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7543.84s)]
*  And you already drove me. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7546.08s)]
*  So all the comics and Dave's friends and stuff are piled in the car. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7547.76s)]
*  Dave is in the passenger seat. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7551.76s)]
*  And then you're like, hey, Fahim, get in. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7554.24s)]
*  I wasn't even going to ask. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7556.24s)]
*  I was going to Uber. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7557.04s)]
*  I was just going to be forgotten. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7558.08s)]
*  But you're like, Fahim, get in. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7560.16s)]
*  So Dave Chappelle has to do the human thing of pushing his seat up. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7562.16s)]
*  So I'm like, excuse me, Mr. Chappelle, can I? [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7568.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7570.719999999999s)]
*  You know? [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7571.92s)]
*  So I'm having to squish Chappelle to get into the back of this car. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7572.88s)]
*  And then you just like, you're ripping. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7576.719999999999s)]
*  You're ripping in this thing. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7578.48s)]
*  And I just thought, man, if I died in this car, I would not make the article. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7580.0s)]
*  It would say Joe Rogan, Dave Chappelle, and two other guys died. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7586.719999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7592.639999999999s)]
*  They probably mentioned your name. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7593.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7594.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7595.5199999999995s)]
*  But at that moment, at that moment, no, I would be a guy. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7596.0s)]
*  But that was such a fun experience. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7599.6s)]
*  It was fun. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7601.12s)]
*  What a wild night. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7601.84s)]
*  Yeah, it was very fun. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7602.88s)]
*  Those shows at Stubbs were like medicine. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7603.84s)]
*  I didn't really realize how much we needed to have a good time. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7608.400000000001s)]
*  The crowds, too. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7611.92s)]
*  They were so appreciative. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7612.88s)]
*  That's one of the things I noticed when I was doing Stand Up out here, [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7614.320000000001s)]
*  is the thirst. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7617.4400000000005s)]
*  And it was human nature. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7618.400000000001s)]
*  For as much as we needed it, the audience needed it, too, to have that kind of release [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7619.76s)]
*  and something to go to rather than just being in your house all day. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7625.44s)]
*  Yeah, people felt trapped. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7630.639999999999s)]
*  And it didn't make sense when a bunch of them... [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7632.719999999999s)]
*  One of the things we did at the shows of the Vulcan, [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7636.16s)]
*  we'd be like, how many guys had COVID? [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7638.0s)]
*  And more than half the crowd would raise their hands. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7639.5199999999995s)]
*  Who wants to get it tonight? [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7644.24s)]
*  You get people on stage, open your mouth. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7645.839999999999s)]
*  Like you've been baptized. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7649.2s)]
*  Yeah, it was weird. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7650.32s)]
*  The power of COVID compels you. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7651.92s)]
*  People started treating it like a regular cold. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7654.4s)]
*  I feel like that's what it is now. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7658.08s)]
*  It definitely is now. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7659.44s)]
*  Unless you're insane. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7661.2s)]
*  You're one of those people that talks outside with a fucking mask on. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7662.639999999999s)]
*  There's still some people that are insane. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7665.44s)]
*  They're just insane. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7667.2s)]
*  But it's also a leftist flag. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7668.16s)]
*  I say it's like the Democrats' MAGA hat. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7669.919999999999s)]
*  Unless you're an old person and you're really scared and you have a bad immune system. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7674.16s)]
*  I get it. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7677.919999999999s)]
*  When I see it at the grocery store, it's like seeing someone in a throwback jersey. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7678.4s)]
*  It's like a cool old Mariners jersey. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7684.16s)]
*  A lot of people still believe in it. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7686.5599999999995s)]
*  They still believe you can breathe through something [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7688.48s)]
*  and it protects you from a terrible disease. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7690.48s)]
*  Could you imagine thinking that the plague is in this neighborhood? [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7692.5599999999995s)]
*  Some fucking 28 days later disease is in this neighborhood. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7697.2s)]
*  You can just put a little paper mask over your face. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7699.839999999999s)]
*  You're good? [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7702.24s)]
*  You feel comfortable? [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7702.96s)]
*  How about what's going in your eyes, stupid? [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7703.839999999999s)]
*  Because that's one of the major ways that people get infected. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7706.4s)]
*  It's through eye contact, through hand to eye. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7709.2s)]
*  Like your eyes, like when people sneeze, you get it in your eyes. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7712.24s)]
*  You ever see... [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7716.0s)]
*  What the fuck did you tell me? [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7716.5599999999995s)]
*  You're breathing air. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7717.919999999999s)]
*  How does it get into your face? [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7719.04s)]
*  You'll see rapid COVID testing places on corners. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7720.799999999999s)]
*  And I almost look at those as like a psychic spot. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7724.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7727.5199999999995s)]
*  It kind of has the same feel. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7728.24s)]
*  Like who's going into these? [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7729.2s)]
*  Super inaccurate. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7732.48s)]
*  I know a bunch of people who tested negative turned out to be positive. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7733.28s)]
*  It's tricky, man. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7736.96s)]
*  That fucking disease keeps mutating. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7738.799999999999s)]
*  It's a bunch of hundred different fucking strains now. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7740.64s)]
*  Who knows how many different variants are there now? [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7743.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7746.4800000000005s)]
*  How many? [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7746.72s)]
*  It's like five, six? [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7747.360000000001s)]
*  How many variants are there? [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7748.4800000000005s)]
*  Seven? [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7749.92s)]
*  How many COVID variants have been identified? [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7750.72s)]
*  Let's find that out. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7753.120000000001s)]
*  Let's say yes. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7753.76s)]
*  This is the COVID multiverse. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7754.320000000001s)]

*  So you could get a free meal. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7795.68s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7797.84s)]
*  As a nice guy, just as part of the writer's strike. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7798.64s)]

*  What was the advice? [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7819.04s)]
*  Who's saying just if you could write one minute joke every day. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7819.84s)]
*  Just write one joke every day over time. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7823.76s)]

*  That's how I feel about writing totally. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7830.4s)]
*  You just kind of build it in pieces. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7832.08s)]
*  And then if you are regimented about it, when you look back at your notes, you've done all the work. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7833.52s)]
*  I always feel like it's like mining. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7840.56s)]
*  You know, that like sometimes I just hit rocks. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7842.96s)]
*  I'm just hitting rocks. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7845.52s)]
*  But every now and then if I keep mining, I find something cool. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7846.4800000000005s)]
*  Variance of concern. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7850.0s)]
*  So there's classifications. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7853.2s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7855.12s)]
*  I guess we could play this game. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7855.36s)]
*  How many variants of concern? [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7856.72s)]
*  Let's be concerned. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7858.56s)]
*  Okay. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7859.280000000001s)]
*  Let's start with that. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7860.0s)]
*  How many variants of concern are there? [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7861.2s)]
*  There's three. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7863.04s)]
*  Three variants of concern. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7864.88s)]
*  You're way off. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7866.240000000001s)]
*  There are Omicron variants. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7866.88s)]
*  There's a under monitoring, which has got two, so we're at five. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7869.2s)]
*  So it's five under monitoring. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7873.52s)]
*  And now deescalated. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7874.64s)]
*  There's over 50 of that. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7876.0s)]
*  Over 50? [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7880.08s)]
*  Holy shit, dude. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7881.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't know how they classify them. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7883.04s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7885.360000000001s)]
*  There's 50 variants. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7886.64s)]
*  No longer circulating. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7888.56s)]
*  Like it's not hip anymore? [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7889.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's just there's different. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7892.88s)]
*  Spike mutations of interest. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7894.56s)]
*  Oh, God. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7896.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7896.96s)]
*  How scary is all that stuff? [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7897.6s)]
*  How scary is it? [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7899.12s)]
*  They keep doing this gain of function research. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7900.320000000001s)]
*  They're like, let's just keep. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7902.96s)]
*  Oh, is that how COVID started? [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7903.92s)]
*  The gain of function? [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7905.4400000000005s)]
*  That's the primary theory. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7906.160000000001s)]
*  What is gain of function? [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7907.52s)]
*  Gain of function is when you take a virus and you engineer it to make it so that it works on humans. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7908.56s)]
*  So they'll take a virus that works on bats and they'll engineer it so that human beings can catch it. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7915.4400000000005s)]
*  Like, let us get it on that. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7921.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7922.400000000001s)]
*  And they make it look super contagious. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7922.72s)]
*  Also a great idea. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7924.400000000001s)]
*  For those unfamiliar with gain of function research, it essentially means [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7928.64s)]
*  juicing up naturally occurring animal viruses in a lab to make them more infectious amongst humans. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7932.64s)]
*  It's practiced as nothing new. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7937.28s)]
*  Scientists in the United States have long known how to mutate animal viruses to infect humans. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7938.64s)]
*  Sure. Yeah. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7944.32s)]
*  The practice is nothing new. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7945.92s)]
*  It doesn't mean it's not a fucking terrible idea. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7946.96s)]
*  Like, what good has come out of it? [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7949.92s)]
*  That's my question. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7951.2s)]
*  Do you guys know how to stop these things from happening? [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7952.88s)]
*  Because it seems like you didn't stop that last one. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7955.28s)]
*  So what benefit are we getting from the potential of you unleashing deadly super viruses to the world? [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7957.04s)]
*  And is this a thing where because you can do it, you do it because you can get funding? [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7966.0s)]
*  Because that's what you studied in school. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7971.2s)]
*  They just got bored. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7972.48s)]
*  Let's try this bat thing. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7974.16s)]
*  Well, it's what their business is. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7975.2s)]
*  What's your business? [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7976.8s)]
*  My business is studying viruses. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7977.84s)]
*  Can I get research to study viruses? [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7980.08s)]
*  Can I get funds? [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7981.84s)]
*  Well, if you agree with what we say and publicly, we'll give you funds and you can do research. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7982.88s)]
*  And oh, it's not legal for us to fund that research. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7989.04s)]
*  Why don't we fund this company and that company and fund the research? [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7991.679999999999s)]
*  We could say, I don't know what you're talking about. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7994.96s)]
*  And then you could change what you describe as gain of function. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=7996.8s)]
*  And you could say, I am the expert. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8001.36s)]
*  I am science. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8003.28s)]
*  And that's what we went through. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8004.4s)]
*  We went through that for three fucking years. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8005.36s)]
*  It's all about funding, man. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8006.96s)]
*  And at the end of the day, it's pretty clear that shit came from a lab. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8007.839999999999s)]
*  It's pretty clear to all the people that are making any fucking sense [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8012.32s)]
*  that aren't gaslighting the fuck out of you. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8016.16s)]
*  I always thought about like, what if you're the guy who loved batwing soup? [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8020.0s)]
*  And it was getting a bad rap unnecessarily, right? [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8023.04s)]
*  Like, guys, it's not the batwing soup. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8025.92s)]
*  And now he's vindicated. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8027.5199999999995s)]
*  Like, yes, it's the lab. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8028.5599999999995s)]
*  I can continue eating the soup. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8030.4s)]
*  I can keep eating pangolin stew. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8032.0s)]
*  Yeah, you gave my stew a bad name. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8036.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8038.24s)]
*  Remember they were trying to pin it on the pangolin? [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8039.04s)]
*  That was hilarious. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8041.12s)]
*  Oh, that South Park episode was amazing. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8041.679999999999s)]
*  Weird animal. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8043.04s)]
*  Oh, freakiest. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8043.759999999999s)]
*  The freakiest little animal. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8044.879999999999s)]
*  Like a little dinosaur. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8046.639999999999s)]
*  Kind of a cute guy, though. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8047.5199999999995s)]
*  Again, just like that fucking turtle. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8049.36s)]
*  If that thing was gigantic storming through a village, imagine. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8051.839999999999s)]

*  But imagine just eating humans. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8059.28s)]
*  Imagine just plowing through some fucking thatch huts. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8061.44s)]
*  That tongue just slicing you in half. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8064.639999999999s)]
*  Just ripping people's legs apart in front of their families. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8065.84s)]

*  Oh, so is that part of it? [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8074.32s)]
*  You had to eat it as being host? [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8075.759999999999s)]
*  I did it because like I did it to get people to do it. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8077.2s)]

*  Ew. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8095.28s)]
*  Yeah, and it was a big one. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8095.84s)]
*  A Madagascar hissing cockroach. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8097.28s)]

*  and the squish in your mouth, but it doesn't taste like much. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8106.48s)]

*  Were the crew people like, you don't have to do this? [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8132.88s)]
*  No, I was trying to get this girl to do it. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8135.2s)]
*  Did she do it? [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8137.759999999999s)]
*  She wound up eating worms instead, which I thought was worse. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8138.96s)]
*  We made a deal with her. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8141.759999999999s)]
*  Two worms. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8142.96s)]
*  Two worms or a roach. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8143.759999999999s)]
*  What was the thought when you did Fear Factor? [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8145.12s)]
*  I heard it was, you didn't love acting as much. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8146.5599999999995s)]
*  Is that what it was? [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8150.16s)]
*  Well, the process of sitcoms is great when it's up and running. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8151.04s)]
*  But it's brutal to begin. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8156.64s)]
*  Like the early days of News Radio. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8158.48s)]
*  I love that show, by the way. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8160.96s)]
*  It was a thank you. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8162.0s)]
*  It was great shows. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8162.72s)]
*  I loved watching it. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8163.12s)]
*  That was like 16 hour days. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8164.16s)]
*  You work crazy long days and the writers are busting their ass and the actors are. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8165.92s)]
*  Everyone's tired. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8170.48s)]
*  The crew's tired. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8171.36s)]
*  It's hard to put together those fucking shows. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8172.5599999999995s)]
*  I thought sitcom was a better schedule. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8174.4s)]
*  Like I heard these 16 hour days are with single cams and stuff. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8177.28s)]
*  Once they get going, the thing is you have to figure out a way to make it a well-oiled machine. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8180.08s)]
*  And that takes a long time. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8185.28s)]
*  The actors have to be in line. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8187.12s)]
*  They have to figure out who whose strengths are. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8188.799999999999s)]
*  The writers have to be in line. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8191.28s)]
*  They have to get support from the network. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8193.039999999999s)]
*  It's a grind, man. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8194.56s)]
*  Did you guys eventually get to a strength line? [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8195.84s)]
*  We eventually got to the point where we didn't even have to work five days a week. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8197.44s)]
*  We only work four days a week. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8200.08s)]
*  And one of the days was just a table read. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8201.52s)]
*  So we'd come in. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8203.44s)]
*  There would be a table read. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8204.16s)]
*  Then there'd be some revisions. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8205.28s)]
*  The writers would get together and they'd come up with new scripts. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8207.04s)]
*  And the writers are crazy. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8210.24s)]
*  They would write like really late at night. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8211.44s)]
*  Like that was their thing to get silly, to like be exhausted. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8213.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8216.08s)]
*  Just delirious. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8216.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8217.52s)]
*  They just get completely delirious and write the most ridiculous shit. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8217.84s)]
*  It was really fun. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8220.720000000001s)]
*  They would come stumbling in like barely awake at like nine in the morning when we're all there. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8221.68s)]
*  They had just finished. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8226.16s)]
*  And some of them, sometimes they didn't finish. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8227.68s)]
*  Sometimes they had like one half of the script and they were still tightening up to second half. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8229.28s)]
*  So they'd give you the first half of the script. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8233.52s)]
*  You'd work on it until lunch. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8235.04s)]
*  Everybody eat lunch. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8236.640000000001s)]
*  And then they would come back with the second half of the script and you'd work the rest of it out. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8237.6s)]
*  And in the beginning, it was exciting and it was fun and everything. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8241.6s)]
*  But I was like, this is not my jam. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8245.12s)]
*  You know, this is really fun to do. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8248.32s)]
*  You're great. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8249.84s)]
*  Thanks. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8250.400000000001s)]
*  It's fun. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8251.28s)]
*  Acting's fun with fun people. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8252.08s)]
*  But eventually I was like, I just like doing stand up and I like doing other things. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8254.32s)]
*  And then this show, Fear Factor was like, [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8259.44s)]
*  I was like, this is going to get canceled immediately. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8261.52s)]
*  Like you're sick and dogs on people on television and making them eat animal dicks. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8263.92s)]
*  Like I'm in. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8267.84s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8268.880000000001s)]
*  You're going to make a ride bulls. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8269.6s)]
*  OK. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8271.2s)]
*  I'm like, OK. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8271.84s)]
*  So they came to you first. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8272.880000000001s)]
*  You were first option. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8273.84s)]
*  They go, do you want to host this show? [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8274.640000000001s)]
*  Well, they didn't know who was going to host it. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8276.560000000001s)]
*  They met with a bunch of people. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8278.800000000001s)]
*  And it was NBC, right? [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8280.08s)]
*  It was NBC. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8280.880000000001s)]
*  So I had just been on NBC for news radio. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8281.68s)]
*  And so I had a relationship with them. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8283.92s)]
*  And so then when this came up, it was just like they said, you know, [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8285.6s)]
*  there was two thoughts. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8290.96s)]
*  One, have someone host it that was like a sports guy. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8291.919999999998s)]
*  You know, like fear is not a factor for them down the middle. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8297.199999999999s)]
*  Or someone who's like laughing while this crazy shit was going on. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8300.72s)]
*  So they chose me. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8303.919999999998s)]
*  So that's what's better. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8305.199999999999s)]
*  It worked out. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8306.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8307.119999999999s)]
*  Well, you had to make fun of some of it because it was so crazy that you were doing this. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8307.439999999999s)]
*  And some of the things I was like, don't do it. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8311.439999999999s)]
*  I would tell people, don't do it. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8313.199999999999s)]
*  Like the bull riding. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8314.48s)]
*  I'm like, don't do it. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8315.439999999999s)]
*  They're not paying you enough for this. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8316.0s)]
*  No one's paying you enough to ride a fucking bull. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8317.039999999999s)]
*  You get kicked in the head by a bull. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8318.8s)]
*  Your life has changed forever. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8320.0s)]
*  I'm like, I'm not going to do whatever you want. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8321.36s)]
*  But you don't have health insurance. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8323.92s)]
*  I wouldn't do it. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8324.96s)]
*  I told them all. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8326.08s)]
*  I'm like, I wouldn't do it. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8326.56s)]
*  They were trying to tell me that it was stunt bulls. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8327.36s)]
*  That bull does not know it's a stunt bull. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8329.12s)]
*  That bull thinks it's a fucking bull. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8330.88s)]
*  Doesn't even know what a stunt bull is. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8332.16s)]
*  That's a giant fucking angry animal that doesn't want you on its back. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8333.44s)]
*  And you're getting like untrained people and you're putting a helmet on them. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8337.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8341.28s)]
*  And a chest plate. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8341.52s)]
*  Some data entry guy hopping on a bull. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8342.32s)]
*  Hoping their arm doesn't get shattered into a fucking million pieces. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8344.16s)]
*  If they're lucky. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8347.28s)]
*  That's just good TV, Joe. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8348.08s)]
*  Kicked in the face. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8349.04s)]
*  Terrifying. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8351.28s)]
*  Sometimes I see shows like Wipeout, even. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8352.720000000001s)]
*  I'm like, why would I risk this? [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8354.240000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8356.960000000001s)]
*  You're going to get hit with a giant roose. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8357.44s)]
*  Really? [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8359.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8359.68s)]
*  They just love people get him fucked up. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8360.160000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8361.84s)]
*  Well, it's like, hey, this is the game we play. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8363.2s)]
*  I guess. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8365.84s)]
*  And then also you. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8366.400000000001s)]
*  We saw that guy jumping over the bulls. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8367.36s)]
*  That guy's out of his fucking mind, too. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8368.880000000001s)]
*  But he's willingly doing that. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8370.400000000001s)]
*  And he's in control. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8373.28s)]
*  He's not being thrust into it. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8374.480000000001s)]
*  You know, this is his life. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8375.68s)]
*  But in their defense, there are people that go on Fear Factor, [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8377.04s)]
*  or that went on Fear Factor, were like serious fucking athletes. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8380.640000000001s)]
*  And they excelled at a lot of these things. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8384.400000000001s)]
*  And you're like, oh, well, if you're a real athlete, [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8387.36s)]
*  you could do some of this shit. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8389.92s)]
*  And you could do it better than everybody else. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8391.2s)]
*  Just like you could play football better than everybody else. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8392.800000000001s)]
*  Or wrestle better than everybody else. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8394.640000000001s)]
*  So it wasn't all eating shit. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8396.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8397.52s)]
*  It was a lot of physical stunts. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8398.160000000002s)]
*  We had a celebrity one in the Miz. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8399.6s)]
*  WWE, the Miz. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8402.880000000001s)]
*  He was on it. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8404.480000000001s)]
*  He won. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8405.04s)]
*  That fucking dude's an athlete. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8406.0s)]
*  Like a real athlete. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8407.6s)]
*  He held his breath underwater while he was swimming [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8408.88s)]
*  for like two fucking minutes or three minutes. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8410.8s)]
*  It was something crazy. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8412.64s)]
*  He was doing some stunt. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8413.92s)]
*  They had to dive into water and do a bunch of shit and come out. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8415.44s)]
*  I forget what it was. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8417.68s)]
*  But I was like, that guy's a stud. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8418.32s)]
*  Because that is hard. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8420.32s)]
*  Like me as a person who's like, I've tried to hold my breath [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8422.08s)]
*  for long periods of time underwater. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8425.44s)]
*  I've swam. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8426.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8427.44s)]
*  I'm like, that's fucking hard to do. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8427.92s)]
*  That water's cold as shit, which really freaks you out [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8429.36s)]
*  when you get in there. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8432.32s)]
*  Everything like tightens up. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8433.04s)]
*  If you're not accustomed to jumping into cold water, [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8434.4s)]
*  it's very difficult to stay relaxed. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8436.8s)]
*  And this dude's swimming around in there for like three minutes. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8438.72s)]
*  I'm like, that's an animal. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8441.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8442.32s)]
*  So there's like, yeah, you shouldn't ride a bull. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8442.88s)]
*  But some of those fucking things that people do, [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8447.119999999999s)]
*  it's like if you're a real athlete, [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8450.24s)]
*  you can excel at a lot of these things. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8452.4s)]
*  What was the grand prize for these things? [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8453.92s)]
*  Depend on the show. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8455.52s)]
*  I mean, in some shows we gave away a million dollars. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8456.32s)]
*  But that was only a couple of them. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8458.08s)]
*  Most of the time they got like, I think it was 50 grand. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8459.52s)]
*  But then after taxes, it's only like 34. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8462.56s)]
*  The government's like, I ate those dicks. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8464.72s)]
*  We ate those dicks. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8467.119999999999s)]
*  The government's like, where's my money? [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8469.6s)]
*  Where's my cut? [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8470.96s)]
*  The government didn't eat any dicks and they get 16 grand. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8472.0s)]
*  Yeah, Uncle Sam didn't eat dicks. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8474.56s)]
*  Yeah, they ate zero dick and they get 16. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8476.56s)]
*  And I got to give my dick money to this guy? [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8478.32s)]
*  All the dick, you get 34. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8479.84s)]
*  Yeah, fortunately, praise the baby Jesus, nobody got hurt. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8482.64s)]
*  Oh, that's good. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8486.4s)]
*  Nobody got really hurt. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8487.119999999999s)]
*  I mean, people get like sprained ankles. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8488.0s)]
*  I'm sure it was an ironclad contract that these people signed. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8489.92s)]
*  I'm sure it was nuts. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8492.880000000001s)]
*  I'm sure it was nuts. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8493.84s)]
*  But I legitimately thought it was going to be canceled immediately. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8495.36s)]
*  And it lasted how long? [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8498.8s)]
*  Six fucking years, 148 episodes. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8500.24s)]
*  And then we came back and did it six more. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8502.8s)]
*  And then it got canceled the second time because people had to drink Jizz. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8504.64s)]
*  Because it got released. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8508.0s)]
*  It got released on TMZ. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8510.0s)]
*  They got a hold of the video and the photo. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8511.92s)]
*  Somebody leaked it. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8514.880000000001s)]
*  What kind of Jizz? [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8516.32s)]
*  Donkey Jizz. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8517.28s)]
*  Which is just useless Jizz. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8518.48s)]
*  How so? [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8520.48s)]
*  Was it mule Jizz or Donkey Jizz? [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8521.92s)]
*  I think it was. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8523.84s)]
*  They had a choice. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8524.4s)]
*  I think we called it Donkey Jizz. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8524.88s)]
*  I think it's mule Jizz. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8525.6s)]
*  Would you like the mule Jizz? [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8526.0s)]
*  It's sterile Jizz. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8527.039999999999s)]
*  You can't like mules, you can't, they can't impregnate anyone. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8528.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8532.64s)]
*  I think they call it Donkey Jizz though. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8532.96s)]
*  I think it might have been actually mule Jizz. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8536.4s)]
*  Because that was the cheapest stuff. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8538.96s)]
*  That's the budget. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8540.24s)]
*  There's a budget when you're working on a show. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8541.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we can't get the thoroughbred Jizz. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8542.48s)]
*  Yeah, thoroughbred Jizz is super expensive. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8544.56s)]
*  It is. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8546.32s)]
*  It's like gold. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8546.56s)]
*  What is that? [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8547.199999999999s)]
*  Million of dollars? [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8547.92s)]
*  Yeah, right under that guy, that yoga guy. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8549.12s)]
*  Oh, Bikram Yoga? [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8554.0s)]
*  You ever see that? [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8554.8s)]
*  That documentary? [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8555.52s)]
*  When he's like, people will pay one million dollars for one drop of my sperm. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8556.48s)]
*  That's what he said. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8561.52s)]
*  It sounds like a lance bit. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8562.16s)]
*  It does. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8564.48s)]
*  I like Donkey Jizz so. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8565.6s)]
*  They called it Donkey Jizz but I think that's because Donkey is a funnier name than mule Jizz. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8568.08s)]
*  That's a good point. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8572.24s)]
*  And so yeah, so they had to do it. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8573.6s)]
*  And there was twins. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8575.28s)]
*  So one had to drink urine and one had to drink Jizz. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8576.16s)]
*  And depending upon your score, depending upon how many ounces you had to drink. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8579.84s)]
*  Rough stuff, ladies and gentlemen. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8585.36s)]
*  And that's another show where I said, don't do it. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8587.68s)]
*  And they're like, NBC signed off on it. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8590.56s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8592.32s)]
*  I'm like, first of all. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8593.039999999999s)]
*  This is outrageous and I've seen a lot of stuff. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8594.64s)]
*  High as a kite. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8596.4s)]
*  Okay, I never did that show sober. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8597.44s)]
*  From episode like four on, I would take pot edibles for every show. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8599.28s)]
*  I was like, let's go. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8603.039999999999s)]
*  I made it fun. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8604.32s)]
*  I'm sure it enhanced the viewing experience. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8604.96s)]
*  It made it so much more fun. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8607.119999999999s)]
*  But that was one day where I was like, you guys are freaking me out. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8609.839999999998s)]
*  Don't do this. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8613.199999999999s)]
*  This is a terrible idea. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8614.08s)]
*  Did you know that this could be the end doing this stunt? [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8615.359999999999s)]
*  100%. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8619.279999999999s)]
*  You're making people drink Jizz. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8621.439999999999s)]
*  I couldn't believe that I was the one. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8623.039999999999s)]
*  The voice of reason. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8625.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I was the one who stepped in and go, hey guys. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8626.08s)]
*  The guy on the edible. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8628.0s)]
*  You can't make people drink Jizz on television while people are eating dinner. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8628.72s)]
*  And the writers are like, we think it's good. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8632.88s)]
*  We workshopped it. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8635.36s)]
*  Imagine trying to explain that to little kids all over the world. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8636.16s)]
*  What's Jizz? [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8639.76s)]
*  I think in other countries, they did play it. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8640.960000000001s)]
*  That's why it's still available on YouTube. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8642.64s)]
*  I could still find that that band episode. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8644.16s)]
*  I think in some countries, I think they played it in Holland. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8646.88s)]
*  They played in some European countries. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8649.44s)]
*  They're way more chill with Mule Jizz out there. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8650.8s)]
*  They're like, hey. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8653.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's like nudity in France. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8654.72s)]
*  They're very cool with Mule Jizz. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8656.16s)]
*  Well, Fear Factor actually started out in Holland. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8657.76s)]
*  What was it called? [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8660.72s)]
*  I think it was called Now or Neverland. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8661.36s)]
*  Pretty sure it was Holland. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8663.76s)]
*  And then they bought it and then changed it to Fear Factor and brought it to America. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8665.04s)]
*  I guess every game show is just a remix of something overseas. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8671.6s)]
*  We do that a lot. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8675.76s)]
*  But what it was for me, dude, was like my escape package. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8677.04s)]
*  Your parachute? [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8681.68s)]
*  Yeah, like my fuck you package. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8682.560000000001s)]
*  Did you know? [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8686.720000000001s)]
*  I could just do whatever I wanted. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8687.28s)]
*  And that's when the podcast came after I was done with that. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8688.24s)]
*  Yeah, you have a great sixth sense for just like not even stumbling, [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8691.68s)]
*  but just like knowing what the next thing is. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8695.28s)]
*  You know, like Fear Factor gave you a nice parachute away from sitcom [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8697.2s)]
*  and all that stuff you didn't like. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8701.28s)]
*  And then podcasting was a nice runway to get into that. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8702.480000000001s)]
*  And then you were so early to UFC too, you know? [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8705.2s)]
*  But the UFC thing was that that was the craziest [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8708.24s)]
*  because I was into the UFC when it was in 1997. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8711.12s)]
*  I remember when you had to go through a beaded curtain to watch UFC. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8714.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you have to go to the video store. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8717.92s)]
*  In Hollywood video, I had to go through a beaded curtain. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8719.04s)]
*  Yeah, you have to go to the dirty side. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8721.28s)]
*  Yeah, I remember. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8722.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you had to like walk by porno and shit to get the UFC tapes. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8724.400000000001s)]
*  I was at my friend Leo Mariama, I believe his last name, this Japanese kid. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8727.84s)]
*  He had a UFC tape for his birthday party and he popped that in. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8734.0s)]
*  And this was like wild. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8737.68s)]
*  You couldn't believe it was real. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8741.2s)]
*  Yeah, these guys are beating the shit out of each other. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8742.400000000001s)]
*  This is crazy. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8744.240000000002s)]
*  So you couldn't just get it. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8744.880000000001s)]
*  It was hard to get. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8746.080000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8746.880000000001s)]
*  So I started working for them in 1997, UFC 12 in Dothan, Alabama. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8747.939999999999s)]
*  And it was just crazy. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8753.46s)]
*  It was like a half-filled high school auditorium looking place. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8754.9s)]
*  What do you think the biggest jump was? [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8758.339999999998s)]
*  TV, getting on Spike TV. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8760.339999999998s)]
*  It's one of those things where people just needed to see it. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8762.98s)]
*  They needed to see it to know how exciting it is. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8765.46s)]
*  You know, there's certain things that people just don't know yet. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8768.339999999998s)]
*  And then they got it on Spike TV. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8770.98s)]
*  It was all Dana White and the Fratida brothers. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8773.14s)]
*  They were like $40 million in debt before it really hit. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8776.82s)]
*  What was their venture? [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8780.02s)]
*  Did they have a venture before UFC? [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8780.980000000001s)]
*  They owned casinos. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8783.380000000001s)]
*  So they were wealthy, but they were fucking hemorrhaging money. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8785.300000000001s)]
*  I mean, hemorrhaging money doing that program. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8788.74s)]
*  But I was like, God damn, the world needs to see. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8792.82s)]
*  If the world could see, it's so entertaining. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8797.460000000001s)]
*  It transcends all cultural boundaries. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8799.62s)]
*  What fighting is, is something that's in human beings DNA. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8802.82s)]
*  And when you see a really great fight between two highly skilled, [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8807.22s)]
*  at the peak of condition, just warriors, the best in the world. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8813.779999999999s)]
*  And when you see them go in a war inside of a cage with these little gloves on [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8819.06s)]
*  and shorts, no shoes on, just fucking teeing off on each other. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8823.779999999999s)]
*  It is wild to see. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8828.18s)]
*  There's nothing like it in all of sports. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8829.86s)]
*  Nothing like it, man. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8832.58s)]
*  A real high level championship fight. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8833.78s)]
*  There's nothing like it, man. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8836.58s)]
*  And I knew people just had to see it. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8838.42s)]
*  And if they could see it, they could see what I see. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8840.18s)]
*  Because this is universal. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8842.58s)]
*  It's not like a game like cricket. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8843.94s)]
*  You could be awesome at cricket. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8845.539999999999s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck's going on. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8846.66s)]
*  I know you're trying to hit that thing with the paddle. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8848.82s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense to me. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8850.66s)]
*  I don't know the rules. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8851.78s)]
*  I'm not interested. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8852.9s)]
*  They're fighting. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8853.7s)]
*  Anyone can wrap their head around. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8854.66s)]
*  Anyone knows what's going on. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8855.62s)]
*  Everyone knows what's going on. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8858.34s)]
*  You will kick somebody in the head. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8859.539999999999s)]
*  Everybody saw that. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8861.06s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8862.02s)]
*  What the fuck just happened? [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8862.82s)]
*  You get that guy in an arm bar and break his arm. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8864.26s)]
*  Like, what? [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8866.02s)]
*  He just broke his arm. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8866.74s)]
*  This is crazy. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8867.86s)]
*  This is nuts. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8869.220000000001s)]
*  What is this? [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8870.26s)]
*  It's just universal. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8871.7s)]
*  I knew it would be universal. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8872.74s)]
*  Yeah, fighting is pretty universal. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8873.78s)]
*  I'll watch these wrestling documentaries. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8875.460000000001s)]
*  They're so good. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8878.58s)]
*  Every wrestling documentary is amazing. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8879.86s)]
*  And I think that's part of the appeal of wrestling they talk about. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8881.78s)]
*  Because it's such a play. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8884.34s)]
*  It's so simple. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8886.26s)]
*  Fighting. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8886.980000000001s)]
*  Everyone knows this. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8887.62s)]
*  And there's so many elements you can have on top of. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8889.140000000001s)]
*  Going heel. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8891.14s)]
*  And it's dramatic. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8891.779999999999s)]
*  It's inherently dramatic. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8893.859999999999s)]
*  Almost the simplest form of entertainment. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8895.859999999999s)]
*  Fighting. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8897.539999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8898.26s)]
*  Well, in a lot of ways, yeah. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8899.46s)]
*  It's also such a dangerous game, man. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8901.3s)]
*  Such a dangerous game. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8903.699999999999s)]
*  And it's hard for guys to know when to stop playing it. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8906.019999999999s)]
*  It's hard for guys to know when to get out. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8909.46s)]
*  And you see all the great ones, man. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8911.779999999999s)]
*  All the great ones fall. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8913.699999999999s)]
*  And it's just part of the game. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8915.619999999999s)]
*  Has anyone got out at the right time? [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8917.539999999999s)]
*  George St. Pierre. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8919.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8920.42s)]
*  He did it the most intelligently. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8921.46s)]
*  Better than anybody. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8923.539999999999s)]
*  He went out as a champion. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8924.58s)]
*  He retired after defending his belt. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8926.099999999999s)]
*  And then he came back and he fought Michael Bisping for the middleweight title and beat him. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8928.5s)]
*  And then retired again. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8933.38s)]
*  So that's it. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8934.5s)]
*  And he's got all of his faculties. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8935.699999999999s)]
*  You talk to him. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8937.46s)]
*  He's great. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8938.5s)]
*  He's super happy. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8939.22s)]
*  Still very healthy and fit. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8940.5s)]
*  Still constantly trains martial arts. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8942.42s)]
*  Comes to Austin all the time to train with Gordon Ryan and John Donahue. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8944.019999999999s)]
*  So he's here all the time. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8948.74s)]
*  And he's just a martial artist. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8951.22s)]
*  I mean, and a great spokesperson. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8953.14s)]
*  He had a great example of what is possible. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8954.9s)]
*  Like that you can be one of the greatest of all time without a doubt. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8957.38s)]
*  George St. Pierre will go down in history as one of the greatest mixed martial artists of all time. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8962.34s)]
*  For sure. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8966.9s)]
*  He's definitely in the conversation of the goat. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8967.3s)]
*  There's a few people that are in that conversation, but he's definitely in there. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8969.859999999999s)]
*  But that guy's totally fine today. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8973.3s)]
*  He figured it out. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8975.939999999999s)]
*  He's very smart. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=8976.82s)]

*  That's fun. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9479.78s)]
*  Check it out. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9480.42s)]
*  That's fun. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9480.9s)]
*  It's ridiculous, but it's fun. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9481.300000000001s)]
*  It's good. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9483.060000000001s)]
*  Is it as good as the Charlie Sheen, Porsche Heist movie? [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9483.7s)]
*  Almost. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9486.66s)]
*  Almost, okay. [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9487.300000000001s)]
*  It's basically- [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9488.1s)]
*  If it's close, if it's close, I'm game. [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9488.5s)]
*  It's fun. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9490.66s)]
*  It's a fun movie. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9491.54s)]
*  So a female John Wick with Aliens. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9492.74s)]
*  I'm sold. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9496.18s)]
*  I'm sold. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9497.78s)]
*  They even went, like when they gave up, [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9499.54s)]
*  they went Predator versus Alien. [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9501.06s)]
*  Remember that? [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9502.66s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9503.14s)]
*  What the fuck are you doing? [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9504.26s)]
*  I feel like there was a Taco Bell tie-in. [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9505.38s)]
*  Yeah, why not? [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9509.619999999999s)]
*  Why wouldn't it be? [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9510.18s)]
*  When you said Jackie Brown, you weren't really wrong [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9510.9s)]
*  because Pam Grier is Jackie Brown, right? [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9513.06s)]
*  Oh, there was one before. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9514.9s)]
*  So she was in movies in the 70s. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9516.019999999999s)]
*  That's why she was Jackie Brown, I think. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9518.1s)]
*  Right. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9519.779999999999s)]
*  What movies was she in the 70s, though? [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9520.1s)]
*  Foxy Brown. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9521.699999999999s)]
*  Foxy Brown. [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9522.5s)]
*  The thing about it is, though, I don't think they were big action movies. [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9524.1s)]
*  When you got a budget, like a Sigourney Weaver is the lead of a Ripley Scott film. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9529.46s)]
*  And it's a giant budget. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9535.939999999999s)]
*  It's a crazy movie. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9537.3s)]
*  That was a huge hit. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9538.58s)]
*  That movie was a huge hit. [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9540.019999999999s)]
*  He did Gladiator, too? [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9541.619999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9542.9s)]
*  They're doing Gladiator, too. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9543.46s)]
*  Ripley Scott has done, he did one of the Aliens. [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9544.259999999998s)]
*  The first one was only 11 million. [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9547.46s)]
*  Budget. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9548.98s)]
*  That's it? [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9549.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9550.259999999998s)]
*  Damn. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9550.66s)]
*  But it had big actors, right? [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9553.859999999999s)]
*  That one dude, Tom Scherick, whatever the fuck his name is. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9555.699999999999s)]
*  In retrospect, maybe. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9559.38s)]
*  That guy was big at the time. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9561.06s)]
*  This is five years before I was even born. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9562.74s)]
*  Tom what? [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9564.34s)]
*  Scherick. [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9565.86s)]
*  Tom Scherick. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9566.82s)]
*  Yeah, he played the captain. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9568.02s)]
*  It's a crazy ass fucking movie, man. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9570.1s)]
*  That's a good movie. [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9571.699999999999s)]
*  Because that's probably what it's going to be like. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9573.38s)]
*  It's probably going to be like Parasites. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9575.38s)]
*  Just like Parasites on Earth. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9576.98s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of different instances in the wild of creatures doing that. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9579.14s)]
*  There's that wasp that injects tarantulas with its babies. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9584.82s)]
*  It kills spiders and injects them with its babies. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9591.380000000001s)]
*  And the babies feed off the carcass of the spider. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9593.78s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9597.460000000001s)]
*  They're so evil. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9598.1s)]
*  Isn't there one where there's this parasite that grows out of an ant's head? [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9598.9s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9602.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9602.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9603.220000000001s)]
*  That's cordyceps mushrooms. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9603.78s)]
*  That movie The Last of Us is based on. [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9606.26s)]
*  Dude, that's so good. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9608.74s)]
*  I love that show. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9609.78s)]
*  Show's great. [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9610.58s)]
*  It shows great. [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9611.300000000001s)]
*  Maybe it was a Reddit thread. [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9612.82s)]
*  Because they tried to port over video game movies for so long and they could never get it right. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9614.5s)]
*  I think the person in this thread was saying, [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9620.42s)]
*  like the kids are finally old enough and becoming directors where they can do [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9623.14s)]
*  the source material justice. [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9626.82s)]
*  Whereas before it was just these people who are trying to make a Mortal Kombat film, [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9628.42s)]
*  but they didn't grow up with, they don't have a love letter to it. [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9632.34s)]
*  Yes. [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9634.98s)]
*  And now we're getting to see great video game IP flourish. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9636.02s)]
*  The Last of Us is phenomenal. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9639.54s)]
*  But it also has to be something like HBO where someone's willing to let someone get really wild. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9641.699999999999s)]
*  That would be hard. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9649.3s)]
*  That was HBO, right? [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9650.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9651.539999999999s)]
*  It'd be hard to do anywhere else. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9651.939999999999s)]
*  Like HBO Game of Thrones, Sopranos. [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9653.38s)]
*  They'll go out there with a show. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9656.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9658.9s)]
*  When I was coming up, I mean, just the video game movies that existed, [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9659.06s)]
*  there was Street Fighter with Van Damme. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9662.34s)]
*  There was Mortal Kombat. [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9664.18s)]
*  So as a kid, you loved watching these movies, but they weren't good. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9666.34s)]
*  Dragon's Lair. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9670.58s)]
*  Wasn't there a Dragon's Lair movie? [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9671.22s)]
*  I don't know if there is. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9672.66s)]
*  Is that a game? [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9673.54s)]
*  Remember that game? [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9674.02s)]
*  I don't remember. [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9674.58s)]
*  Dragon's Lair was a game that everybody used to play. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9675.46s)]
*  Mario Brothers. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9678.26s)]
*  Dragon's Lair was a game that everybody used to play in like the 1980s. [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9679.3s)]
*  And it was like a cartoon of each thing that you did. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9682.98s)]
*  You get to see whether or not you were successful. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9687.38s)]
*  So you would do this little move. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9689.54s)]
*  And if you slipped and fell, or if the knight got you or a dragon got you, you would die. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9690.74s)]
*  But you get to see how you would die. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9696.26s)]
*  So instead of it being like an interactive cartoon, it was like semi-interactive. [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9698.42s)]
*  You've made the right choices. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9702.82s)]
*  It would do the right thing. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9704.98s)]
*  And the character would do the right thing. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9706.34s)]
*  And then you would be hitting your joystick, getting it to go through these doors. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9707.78s)]
*  And then every time you did it, this little video would play out. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9712.74s)]
*  It was very addictive. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9715.62s)]
*  And it was the first time there was ever anything like this, [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9717.06s)]
*  where there was a game that you could watch like a cartoon movie. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9720.5s)]
*  And depending upon whether you did the right thing or the wrong thing, [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9726.099999999999s)]
*  you would see this happen or see you get killed. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9729.539999999999s)]
*  Well, that's 1983. [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9731.779999999999s)]
*  Full playthrough. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9734.179999999998s)]
*  So this is all the things that you would have to do to be successful. [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9737.859999999999s)]
*  And every time you would do it, this little video would play out. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9742.019999999999s)]
*  Is it kind of Prince of Persia-y? [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9744.179999999998s)]
*  That's like, you know, dragons and knights and shit. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9746.58s)]
*  It was fun. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9749.46s)]
*  But, you know, compare that to World of Warcraft or compare that to [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9751.14s)]
*  what's the big one? [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9756.099999999999s)]
*  That Diablo, the new Diablo, or compare that to Call of Duty. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9756.82s)]
*  That's the big one. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9760.42s)]
*  That's just crack. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9762.259999999998s)]
*  That's just straight heroin. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9763.699999999999s)]
*  Did you ever see this game? [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9765.619999999999s)]
*  This was an arcade game that was like Dragon's Lair. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9766.9s)]
*  The only thing that was really cool about this is this was holograms. [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9771.939999999999s)]
*  So this was like floating above your controllers. [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9774.58s)]
*  You control it a lot like Dragon's Lair. [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9777.859999999999s)]
*  That's how it worked. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9779.3s)]
*  It was like these weird little videos that would play. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9779.779999999999s)]
*  Like an old West character. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9782.179999999998s)]
*  But it was all holograms. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9783.46s)]
*  This doesn't do any justice to how cool it was. [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9784.58s)]
*  Oh, so in real life when you're watching it on the video screen, it's a hologram. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9787.06s)]
*  Yeah, it was very strange. [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9790.58s)]
*  It's like in the 90s in arcades. [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9792.74s)]
*  That's how I remembered it. [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9794.02s)]
*  Because that's how I remember Dragon's Lair. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9795.38s)]
*  Busted that blank a little too close to that dude's body for my liking. [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9797.22s)]
*  You know they didn't edit that out. [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9802.34s)]
*  It's not like they had one guy and they spliced in the second guy. [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9803.86s)]
*  How much do you think he was right in front? [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9806.1s)]
*  He got paid. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9807.3s)]
*  $4. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9807.7s)]
*  I got paid by Fortnite. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9809.46s)]
*  They used my dancing in an emote. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9811.06s)]
*  And they paid me. [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9813.779999999999s)]
*  They paid me like five grand. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9814.74s)]
*  Nice. [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9816.18s)]
*  What'd you buy with it? [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9816.66s)]
*  Just like more Fortnite stuff. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9818.42s)]
*  No, I'm just kidding. [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9820.019999999999s)]
*  I have no idea what I spent with it. [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9821.22s)]
*  But it's kind of cool because I post the dance videos sometimes [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9822.82s)]
*  and I guess their programmers found one on my YouTube. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9826.26s)]
*  Like it had no views. [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9828.34s)]
*  Maybe they're comedy fans. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9829.939999999999s)]
*  That's how they found out. [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9830.98s)]
*  But like they just hit me up and they go, [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9831.859999999999s)]
*  hey, the game is going to use this excerpt of you dancing as like a skin or an emote. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9833.619999999999s)]
*  We'll give you five grand. [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9838.74s)]
*  And I was like, fuck yeah. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9839.939999999999s)]
*  It's still one of my favorite credits in Hollywood because it's just so weird and bizarre. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9841.46s)]
*  That you're in Fortnite. [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9845.38s)]
*  I love Fortnite dance. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9846.66s)]
*  Do you play Fortnite? [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9848.179999999998s)]
*  No, but I know it's really popular. [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9849.22s)]
*  So it's called the vibin emote. [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9851.06s)]
*  So if you look at the vibin emote, that's me dancing. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9852.98s)]
*  Oh shit, let me see that. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9855.859999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9856.98s)]
*  So they just took an excerpt from like me when I was dancing in my apartment in Koreatown. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9857.619999999999s)]
*  Sometimes if I really like a song, I'll just set the camera up and dance to it. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9862.98s)]
*  Yeah, that's me. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9867.22s)]
*  There's so many little kids that probably know this shit. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9871.619999999999s)]
*  Oh, this dance. [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9874.66s)]
*  It looks very different than you, bro. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9876.82s)]
*  That's true. [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9878.74s)]
*  They could have just done that. [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9879.539999999999s)]
*  They didn't have to pay you. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9880.66s)]
*  No, you needed me to. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9881.699999999999s)]
*  You needed me as the source. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9882.9s)]
*  I think they could have just paid you. [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9883.859999999999s)]
*  No, I just want to put this out there. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9884.9s)]
*  Fortnite, I have more dances. [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9885.939999999999s)]
*  If you need more moves. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9887.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think they needed to pay you for that. [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9888.9s)]
*  I think they could have just snuck that in if they were like less scrupulous. [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9891.38s)]
*  Probably. [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9894.339999999998s)]
*  But I think they were under hot water because it was a moment in time where [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9894.9s)]
*  people were kind of upset that they were lifting some of the dances. [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9898.66s)]
*  Remember that backpack kid, the floss dance? [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9902.179999999998s)]
*  Remember that little kid? [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9904.98s)]
*  Yeah, remember his name is Backpack Kid, I guess, as a meme. [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9905.939999999999s)]
*  You talking about the kid on the boat? [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9908.82s)]
*  No, you know this is so dumb. [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9910.259999999998s)]
*  You ever see the little kid on the boat? [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9911.859999999999s)]
*  No, but remember this dance? [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9913.06s)]
*  Some kid in a backpack invented it. [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9916.82s)]
*  Fortnite used the dance and then there was some sort of, [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9920.419999999998s)]
*  hey, people should be getting paid, the Carlton they put in there. [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9923.38s)]
*  And there was this gray area of like, should we pay these people? [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9926.58s)]
*  So this kid is saying that that was his move and they stole it? [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9929.46s)]
*  Well, they probably patched it up and played nice and everything, [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9932.66s)]
*  but he's the inventor of that dance. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9935.619999999999s)]
*  Really invented it himself? [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9937.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9938.82s)]
*  There's no dispute? [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9939.38s)]
*  I don't know if anybody else claimed it or tried to say that it was them. [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9940.82s)]
*  What's that called, flossing? [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9944.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9945.619999999999s)]
*  It's a strange move too, so I don't know how he wouldn't have. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9947.859999999999s)]
*  It's pretty cool. [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9950.82s)]
*  Yeah, I like watching people do silly dances. [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9952.98s)]
*  Some dude did this Michael Jackson thing the other day. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9955.539999999999s)]
*  He high-fived this dude and then immediately started moonwalking. [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9958.42s)]
*  It was really good. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9962.1s)]
*  It was very impressive. [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9963.060000000001s)]
*  It's so interesting seeing social media get to a place where there are [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9964.58s)]
*  viable careers in these spaces that didn't exist before, like Charlie D'Amelio or whatever. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9969.460000000001s)]
*  You could just be a cute girl dancing on TikTok and that used to have to be able to sing [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9974.74s)]
*  and they would send you to acting school if you were a pretty person. [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9980.02s)]
*  They had to give you these other skill sets. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9983.86s)]
*  They had to give you these other skill sets and now you can just dance to certain songs. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9986.34s)]
*  What do you think that's like psychologically? [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9990.980000000001s)]
*  Because at least if you're a person who sings songs, people really love my songs. [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9993.380000000001s)]
*  She probably sings now, but it was a springboard. [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9996.58s)]
*  She got famous for her dancing. [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=9999.220000000001s)]
*  Does she sing? [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10000.66s)]
*  Probably. [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10001.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10002.42s)]
*  Well, imagine someone who doesn't sing. [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10002.9s)]
*  Just imagine being famous just for being alive. [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10004.42s)]
*  That's available to you now. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10008.74s)]
*  That's a new thing. [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10009.86s)]
*  It's a new thing. [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10010.58s)]
*  That's a new thing. [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10011.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10011.94s)]
*  It's also interesting because when I got into comedy, fame was a byproduct, [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10012.92s)]
*  but I think with younger people, sometimes they just want to be famous [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10017.720000000001s)]
*  and they don't really care or know what for. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10021.08s)]
*  I remember we were shooting a thing. [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10023.880000000001s)]
*  We were shooting the Sonic commercial years ago and the kids saw a camera. [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10025.08s)]
*  They so many of them would say, make me famous. [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10028.92s)]
*  It wasn't I want to do a thing that I love and then become famous. [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10032.44s)]
*  They wanted to be famous. [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10036.52s)]
*  Fame is a byproduct. [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10038.12s)]
*  I don't know if it should be the goal. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10040.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10043.16s)]
*  I don't know if that's the healthiest. [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10043.560000000001s)]
*  No, it's not a good goal. [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10045.08s)]
*  Because you'll never sustain it. [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10047.640000000001s)]
*  You're never going to be happy either. [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10049.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10050.6s)]
*  Should be happy if you're doing what you like to do. [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10051.08s)]
*  The idea of just being happy just by fame, that's a trick. [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10055.08s)]
*  That's going to come with a lot of problems of its own and you don't want them. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10058.04s)]
*  You're better off just concentrating on what you love to do and just try to get good at it. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10063.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10068.04s)]
*  Trying to just get famous. [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10069.24s)]
*  You're going to do some stuff that you wish you hadn't done. [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10070.6s)]
*  You're going to say some things you wish you hadn't said. [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10072.44s)]
*  You're going to try to get a lot of attention. [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10074.12s)]
*  It's going to come with a lot of extra baggage. [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10075.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10078.52s)]
*  The fame isn't exactly the fun. [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10079.0s)]
*  There are some parts of it that are fun, but then it also impedes your life. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10081.16s)]
*  Well, it depends on if that's all you do. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10085.800000000001s)]
*  There's people out there that are air quotes influencers. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10088.6s)]
*  All they do is either you're the Kardashians or you're whoever you are. [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10091.32s)]
*  You're doing something and you're making videos. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10096.36s)]
*  Your whole thing is you getting out there. [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10099.4s)]
*  It's not exceptional content. [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10102.52s)]
*  It's not like they're doing crazy backflips and climbing mountains. [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10104.36s)]
*  They're not doing anything crazy. [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10109.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10110.12s)]
*  They're just being alive. [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10110.36s)]
*  Right. [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10111.24s)]
*  Being alive with a lot of money and a big ass. [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10111.64s)]
*  And being beautiful. [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10113.64s)]
*  That helps. [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10114.76s)]
*  That helps, but it's also being around famous people and, oh my God, it's the glamorous life. [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10115.800000000001s)]
*  And then people are sucked in. [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10121.4s)]
*  And if you edit it correctly, we do a nice fast, keep my attention span moving. [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10122.52s)]
*  You can suck me in for years. [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10126.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10129.0s)]
*  You forget editing is such a strong necessity nowadays, too. [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10129.32s)]
*  It's huge. [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10134.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10134.84s)]
*  It's almost more important than a performer. [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10135.24s)]
*  I mean, it's hyperbole, but a great editor can really elevate some content. [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10136.84s)]
*  Like, Shultz's guy's amazing. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10140.84s)]
*  I mean, Shultz is fantastic to begin with. [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10141.960000000001s)]
*  But editing, when you're trying to grab people's attention in 20, 30 seconds with all the zooms [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10144.04s)]
*  and all these psychological tricks, too, like shaking it, having the text come in. [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10148.2s)]
*  So now even to promote as a younger comic, people coming up, you have to be aware of, [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10153.32s)]
*  you might have a great bit, but you have to have it be a little cuttier than it would be live. [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10158.2s)]
*  You have to use a certain type of captions. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10163.800000000001s)]
*  You have to maybe zoom in. [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10167.16s)]
*  So you have to give yourself, I don't know, the benefit of the doubt or [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10168.6s)]
*  set yourself up for success via editing. [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10173.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10175.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10177.400000000001s)]
*  And there's so many different ways to do it now, too. [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10177.640000000001s)]
*  So many people found different avenues to make viral things. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10181.720000000001s)]
*  Like, remember during the pandemic when Shultz had to turn your phone sideways? [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10185.240000000002s)]
*  Brilliant. [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10188.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10189.08s)]
*  He had a totally different style of comedy than he does because he, you know, on stage, [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10189.560000000001s)]
*  he'll let things cook. [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10194.84s)]
*  He'll have long pauses, give you time to think about some ridiculous shit that he just said. [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10196.2s)]
*  And he's like, yeah. [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10199.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's the fun of the live show. [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10200.76s)]
*  Right. [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10202.6s)]
*  But in these Instagram videos, sideways videos, he was very fast paced. [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10202.84s)]
*  It was very fast paced. [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10208.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10209.800000000001s)]
*  And it's punch line after punch line after punch line. [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10210.52s)]
*  He does the Netflix thing, you know, Shultz Saves America, punch line, punch line, punch line. [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10213.480000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10217.400000000001s)]
*  It's very fast. [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10217.8s)]
*  It's really interesting because he adapted. [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10219.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10220.76s)]
*  Found like some new pathway. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10221.0s)]
*  That's a real sign of intelligence, right? [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10223.08s)]
*  If you could find like a new way to do it. [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10225.32s)]
*  And don't do Zoom standups, son. [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10228.359999999999s)]
*  I mean, of course. [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10230.76s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10231.48s)]
*  But find a way. [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10232.519999999999s)]
*  There's another pathway. [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10234.279999999999s)]
*  There's got to be something else. [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10235.48s)]
*  A lot of people did. [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10236.359999999999s)]
*  They found ways to do funny clips. [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10237.16s)]
*  And you learn just by seeing what is being propagated, how people's behaviors. [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10239.4s)]
*  Even when I edit my standup, I take the air out. [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10244.519999999999s)]
*  If I get a laugh, I'll cut the laugh short just to get to the next part. [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10247.16s)]
*  You're just competing against people's thumbs swiping up. [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10251.32s)]
*  You think like that? [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10254.52s)]
*  Sometimes. [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10255.64s)]
*  Because if you, you can make your joke a little tighter via editing. [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10256.52s)]
*  That's what you're saying. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10262.119999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10262.84s)]
*  Because if you're an unknown and you're just competing about people, [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10263.32s)]
*  you're competing with people swiping their thumb and watching something else. [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10266.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10269.4s)]
*  I think you can't really worry about that. [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10270.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10272.52s)]
*  Well, it's all trial and error too. [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10272.92s)]
*  People still love standup, dude. [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10274.76s)]
*  They're still going to love it. [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10276.76s)]
*  And if it's below jazz in the listings, so be it. [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10278.04s)]
*  I love it. [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10282.44s)]
*  It's fine. [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10283.64s)]
*  It doesn't need any more attention than it gets. [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10284.52s)]
*  It's fine. [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10287.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10287.64s)]
*  The people that love it, love it. [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10287.960000000001s)]
*  The people that don't, that's fine too. [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10289.08s)]
*  It's all fine. [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10290.68s)]
*  Don't worry about who swipes and who doesn't swipe. [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10291.800000000001s)]
*  Worry about doing what you enjoy. [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10295.0s)]
*  Do that thing and make it so that somebody's like, I like it. [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10296.92s)]
*  This is good. [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10299.56s)]
*  Well, I did it the way I wanted to do it. [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10300.36s)]
*  Bam. [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10301.960000000001s)]
*  That's where I'm at now with standup. [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10302.44s)]
*  Perfect. [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10303.72s)]
*  I'm just very happy, especially after doing that last special. [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10303.96s)]
*  I'm at a place where I'm comfortable. [[02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10306.679999999998s)]
*  I call this special, this new one house money [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10309.08s)]
*  because things are great with my parents and financially and career-wise. [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10311.96s)]
*  It's so funny, the pressure of your parents. [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10315.64s)]
*  It's like just an overwhelming blanket. [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10317.48s)]
*  It's a cliche, the whole immigrant, be a doctor, whatever. [[02:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10319.4s)]
*  Yeah, they want you to be successful. [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10322.679999999998s)]
*  It's hard to get over here. [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10324.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but I love them and I know what it was rooted in. [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10324.919999999998s)]
*  It was just rooted in their offspring wanting to do the best that they can. [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10327.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's rooted in love. [[02:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10331.08s)]
*  A little smothering. [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10332.84s)]
*  But you made it out. [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10335.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think it allowed me to be where I'm at now. [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10335.960000000001s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10338.36s)]
*  So it was rocket fuel. [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10338.6s)]
*  There's something to be said for that. [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10340.76s)]
*  There's something to be said for some uncomfortable shit that makes you work harder [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10342.04s)]
*  because the worst situation is you're too comfortable and you don't work hard enough [[02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10346.04s)]
*  and then you don't have a career because you've just been lazy. [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10350.36s)]
*  You could have had a career. [[02:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10353.720000000001s)]
*  We know a lot of guys like that. [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10355.32s)]
*  We know a lot of guys that just for whatever reason, they didn't fucking put it together. [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10357.4s)]
*  They didn't work as hard as everybody else did. [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10361.8s)]
*  They just didn't try as hard. [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10363.4s)]
*  For whatever reason, they just fucking cashed out. [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10365.08s)]
*  It sucks. [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10368.68s)]
*  It's a real bummer because you learned at an early age the value of hard work and discipline [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10370.119999999999s)]
*  and I think a lot of people just don't know the value of that and they just would rather just [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10376.84s)]
*  indulge because indulging is fun. [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10380.76s)]
*  We all love to do it and stand-up comics are, you know, most of us are pretty indulgent, silly. [[02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10383.0s)]
*  So you gotta find a way to harness that like you're the boss of you. [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10387.88s)]
*  You gotta figure out a way to say like, hey, I'm the boss of me. [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10392.92s)]
*  I will sit my ass down and I will fucking work on this shit. [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10396.44s)]
*  There's a level of entrepreneurship that I think is great about stand-up too [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10399.72s)]
*  and I think that's why I work so hard is because I knew what my life would be like [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10403.08s)]
*  if I just stayed at Boeing. [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10406.92s)]
*  It was a means to an end. [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10408.6s)]
*  It's not like I did engineering just so I can get a legit job and be able to move out to LA [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10409.8s)]
*  and drive up to Hollywood. [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10415.24s)]
*  It was always a means to an end but I would always, when I'm in that cubicle, [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10417.24s)]
*  I knew what my life would be like if I just stayed at Boeing. [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10421.88s)]
*  Whereas I didn't know what it would be like. [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10425.08s)]
*  I knew what I wanted it to be and that drove me. [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10426.84s)]
*  Whereas, okay, I know this movie, I don't know this movie and I love this. [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10429.88s)]
*  That was the fire for me. [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10434.68s)]
*  Just not wanting to live for tomorrow. [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10437.32s)]
*  And when you pursue something like that, [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10441.64s)]
*  it's exciting, it's fulfilling. [[02:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10446.679999999998s)]
*  It's very exciting but it's also very daunting, right? [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10448.599999999999s)]
*  Especially in the beginning. [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10451.08s)]
*  God, I remember the early days where I wasn't sure whether it was going to make it. [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10452.279999999999s)]
*  It was just when I was going to be able to make a living. [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10455.0s)]
*  It's so weird. [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10458.119999999999s)]
*  Such a weird feeling. [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10459.0s)]
*  Everything is like open-ended. [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10461.16s)]
*  You never know. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10463.0s)]
*  You don't know the next set you have where you bomb. [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10464.599999999999s)]
*  Oh my God, am I going to have to quit? [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10467.72s)]
*  Do I suck forever? [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10469.24s)]
*  Am I going to figure this out? [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10470.92s)]
*  Those are the best moments when I was young. [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10472.439999999999s)]
*  When I was starting out, it was after bombs. [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10475.24s)]
*  After bombs, I always came out sharper. [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10477.24s)]
*  You learn the most. [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10478.92s)]
*  You come out so much sharper. [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10479.72s)]
*  It sucks but you either get better or you quit. [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10481.48s)]
*  You get better or you quit. [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10484.84s)]
*  I always think about that whenever people get into stand-up. [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10485.88s)]
*  If they bomb and they don't love stand-up, they're out pretty fast. [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10488.28s)]
*  Because that's not a fun feeling. [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10492.36s)]
*  Unless you have a screw loose and you love it and I'm that way. [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10494.039999999999s)]
*  Whereas, I was more emboldened after a bomb. [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10497.24s)]
*  I was like, okay, why didn't it work? [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10499.32s)]
*  How do I tweak this? [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10500.6s)]
*  I took it as the audience being an editor. [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10502.199999999999s)]
*  It was fuel. [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10505.08s)]
*  It's undeniable. [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10506.92s)]
*  They either laugh or they don't. [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10507.720000000001s)]
*  People used to say, I think Bill Cosby says, [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10509.880000000001s)]
*  there's no bad crowds, just bad comedians. [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10512.04s)]
*  He's out of his fucking mind, clearly. [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10513.640000000001s)]
*  I used to say about that, he never had to work the places that I had to work. [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10516.28s)]
*  I had to work bars in the middle of Massachusetts and Rhode Island and fucking Connecticut. [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10519.800000000001s)]
*  Shut your mouth. [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10525.4s)]
*  There's bad, bad audiences. [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10526.2s)]
*  Through those bad audiences, you learn crowd control mitigation shit. [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10529.8s)]
*  You learn how to work the crowd. [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10536.039999999999s)]
*  You learn how to capture people's attention. [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10537.64s)]
*  So you don't let them drift off. [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10540.119999999999s)]
*  They're not all good crowds. [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10543.72s)]
*  You learn how to corral energy. [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10544.92s)]
*  Also, if someone is being disruptive, do they have a good heart? [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10547.0s)]
*  Do they mean well? [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10550.84s)]
*  Is a little too tipsy and kind of harness that back into your set and be playful. [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10551.48s)]
*  Because some comics don't realize and they just go nuclear on the person. [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10555.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10558.68s)]
*  Then it's like beating up a toddler. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10559.56s)]
*  Because then you've lost the goodwill of the crowd. [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10561.16s)]
*  Everyone's like, yo, you just fucked this chick up. [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10563.08s)]
*  For no reason. [[02:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10565.8s)]
*  And then you try to do a joke and they go, no, you're a monster, dude. [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10566.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's basically like having road rage. [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10569.4s)]
*  Like you're in the car, you're like, shut the fuck up. [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10571.56s)]
*  What the fuck are you doing, bro? [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10573.96s)]
*  Fuck you, don't fuck you. [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10575.4s)]
*  You're so amped up because you're already in a car, you're driving fast. [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10577.56s)]
*  When you're on stage, your brain is amped up. [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10580.519999999999s)]
*  When someone chimes in, you're like, what? [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10582.6s)]
*  Shut up, you stupid bitch. [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10584.68s)]
*  Even though he's technically- [[02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10586.439999999999s)]
*  Oh my God, what have you done? [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10587.88s)]
*  There's a nicer way to say keep it down. [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10589.72s)]
*  And you may have lost the crowd by saying, you stupid bitch. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10591.96s)]
*  But then there's some people that you just have to address. [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10594.119999999999s)]
*  Like you have to get rid of them. [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10595.88s)]
*  They're going to ruin your show no matter what you do. [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10597.56s)]
*  And they do it on purpose. [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10599.88s)]
*  Sometimes they're so malicious and mean [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10600.84s)]
*  that you have carte blanche to fucking lay into this guy. [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10603.24s)]
*  And it's kind of fun because sometimes these people are so singular minded [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10605.88s)]
*  and they think the world revolves around them. [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10609.56s)]
*  When the crowd starts booing the person and you see that switch in their eyes, [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10611.64s)]
*  oh, they've been perceiving the whole situation wrong. [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10616.279999999999s)]
*  Why is this entire room booing you if you're the good guy? [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10619.64s)]
*  Everyone's like, get the fuck, shut the fuck up. [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10624.039999999999s)]
*  Fuck you. [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10625.4s)]
*  They got babysitters and shit. [[02:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10626.439999999999s)]
*  They hate this guy. [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10628.039999999999s)]
*  I kind of like teaching a lesson sometimes when that happens. [[02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10630.439999999999s)]
*  I'm like, I do a million sets. [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10632.679999999998s)]

*  Do you hear all these boos? [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10638.279999999999s)]
*  Why are they hissing at you, dude? [[02:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10640.119999999999s)]
*  It's fun to educate sometimes. [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10642.519999999999s)]
*  While some people just they're drunk and they don't even realize [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10644.2s)]
*  what the consequences of what they're doing are. [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10646.68s)]
*  They're just being so selfish. [[02:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10649.640000000001s)]
*  They don't care about the other 300 people in the room. [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10651.16s)]
*  They just want to just yell out. [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10653.240000000002s)]
*  But most of the time they just they mean well, [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10654.76s)]
*  but they've had a few drinks and you can reign them in. [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10657.320000000002s)]
*  Booze is the best and the worst thing for comedy. [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10660.28s)]
*  Yeah, for real. [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10663.560000000001s)]
*  Ideally, you want everyone who's great on it. [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10666.28s)]
*  Yeah, you want people who can handle their liquor. [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10668.52s)]
*  But every now and then you'll get, that's not true. [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10671.08s)]
*  How is it a mothership? [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10673.8s)]

*  Yeah, well, you have to kick people out that are disrupting the show. [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10679.32s)]

*  And it was the night that I was off, I think. [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10703.64s)]
*  Or I wasn't on the show. [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10705.56s)]
*  I don't remember what it was. [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10706.52s)]
*  But either way, the lady went into a K-hole. [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10707.56s)]
*  And they had the Narcan ready. [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10711.24s)]
*  They thought she had overdosed. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10713.0s)]
*  But no, she's just fucking gone. [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10714.84s)]
*  Because a lot of people take this nasal spray of ketamine [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10717.48s)]
*  and they take it like as theroper. [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10721.4s)]
*  Quasi-dimensional traveling in the middle of a comedy show. [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10725.72s)]
*  I don't understand when people go that hard [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10729.32s)]
*  and then pay tickets to an expensive show. [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10731.4s)]
*  Like some people will go to a concert [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10733.48s)]
*  and just be fucked up beyond belief. [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10735.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10738.119999999999s)]
*  You're not even mentally here to enjoy Beyonce [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10742.44s)]
*  or whatever it is. [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10744.68s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10745.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10746.119999999999s)]
*  Well, I think this is the experience. [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10746.92s)]
*  Sometimes people say, I'm going to take an edible [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10748.119999999999s)]
*  and go see a show. [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10749.72s)]
*  You're like, ah! [[02:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10750.52s)]
*  How do you finesse that, though? [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10751.16s)]
*  That lady on K, I don't know if she was really [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10752.44s)]
*  processing the jokes, right? [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10755.16s)]
*  Oh, she definitely wasn't. [[02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10756.52s)]
*  She was gone. [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10757.64s)]
*  She collapsed. [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10759.16s)]
*  She was gone. [[02:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10760.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I've never done ketamine like that. [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10761.72s)]
*  I don't know what happens, but the way they do it, [[02:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10764.199999999999s)]
*  if you do a lot of it, you go into what they call a K-hole. [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10767.48s)]
*  Whatever that means. [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10771.0s)]
*  But I know that people have like hallucinations [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10772.52s)]
*  and they have like these weird experiences [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10774.84s)]
*  where they're interacting with interdimensional beings. [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10777.4s)]
*  They're in empty apartment buildings and space and shit. [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10780.039999999999s)]
*  Weird stuff. [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10783.64s)]
*  Weird stuff. [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10784.84s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10786.279999999999s)]
*  Seems like you don't need a show for that. [[02:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10786.84s)]
*  It seems like a heavy drug. [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10788.6s)]
*  It seems like one that you could be out in the town [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10790.44s)]
*  on that stuff. [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10794.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10795.08s)]
*  But I guess people microdose it. [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10795.480000000001s)]
*  I guess that's the thing. [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10797.16s)]
*  Not this girl. [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10797.960000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10806.68s)]

*  and it would be like mild. [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10809.800000000001s)]
*  He's like, no, I'm tripping balls at the doctor's office. [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10810.92s)]
*  An IV drip, a ketamine just like, [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10814.76s)]
*  whoa. [[03:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10817.16s)]
*  Interacting with space beings and shit. [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10818.76s)]
*  Yeah, I remember when he was going through a phase [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10820.92s)]
*  of trying different things for depression. [[03:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10822.44s)]
*  He was doing it. [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10824.52s)]
*  Magnets. [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10825.08s)]
*  He showed me a video of the magnet thing. [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10825.16s)]
*  And then K, I guess. [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10827.32s)]
*  And then ayahuasca. [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10828.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10829.800000000001s)]

*  I didn't know that you could do ayahuasca that frequently. [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10832.2s)]
*  Whoops. [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10835.56s)]
*  You're probably not supposed to. [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10837.24s)]

*  Yeah, I've noticed. [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10843.4s)]
*  There's a difference. [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10844.36s)]
*  Yeah, I talked about it. [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10845.16s)]
*  I forget what percent you said. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10846.599999999999s)]

*  I'm so scared of ayahuasca. [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10853.08s)]
*  He actually asked me because I like control. [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10854.679999999998s)]
*  Why is that? [[03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10858.599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10859.08s)]

*  Yeah. [[03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10860.439999999999s)]
*  Because you like control. [[03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10860.759999999998s)]
*  Well, yeah, exactly. [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10861.72s)]
*  And you can't control when you're on drugs. [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10863.08s)]
*  Not when those, not mushrooms. [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10865.08s)]

*  I haven't had the opportunity. [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10906.04s)]
*  I haven't had people that I want to do it with. [[03:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10908.12s)]
*  It's illegal in America. [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10911.56s)]
*  So either you do it illegally here or you go somewhere else. [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10913.24s)]
*  Yeah, it shouldn't be. [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10916.84s)]
*  But also, maybe you should know who the fuck is making it [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10917.880000000001s)]
*  and how they're doing it. [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10921.4s)]
*  I've done DMT, though, which is the active ingredient. [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10923.48s)]
*  I saw a guy take a hit from a DMT pen at a party. [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10929.4s)]
*  And it was unsettling to watch him, [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10933.16s)]
*  because you just see him blast off in a chair. [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10935.72s)]
*  I'm like, this is too personal. [[03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10937.72s)]
*  It's almost like seeing a guy jerk off or something. [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10939.08s)]
*  Very weird to do that in front of everybody. [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10941.08s)]
*  He just blasts off for five minutes. [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10942.76s)]
*  And you just see, like, OK. [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10944.52s)]
*  Jesus. [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10947.08s)]
*  It's kind of weird. [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10947.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10948.6s)]
*  It's a potent drug. [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10949.24s)]
*  Like it's a hit off of a vape pen. [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10950.12s)]
*  I think it's a portal into another dimension. [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10952.2s)]
*  I really do. [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10954.84s)]

*  especially from the host of Fear Factor. [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10958.2s)]
*  Right. [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10959.72s)]
*  But I think it's in your mind. [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10960.28s)]
*  They know that your brain produces those chemicals. [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10962.199999999999s)]
*  Why would your brain produce chemicals [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10964.679999999998s)]
*  that let you interact with beings [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10966.119999999999s)]
*  in other dimensions that are giving you wisdom? [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10967.96s)]
*  Why? [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10970.439999999999s)]
*  Why would that be something your brain makes? [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10970.919999999998s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10973.48s)]
*  What the speculation is that your brain makes it [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10974.199999999999s)]
*  when it thinks it's going to die. [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10975.96s)]
*  And that when you interact with that dimension, [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10977.8s)]
*  that's your spirit. [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10981.64s)]
*  That's your soul. [[03:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10982.439999999999s)]
*  That's the essence of you, not your physical being [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10983.24s)]
*  and your life experiences and your memories. [[03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10987.0s)]
*  That's the essence of you goes to this place. [[03:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10989.24s)]
*  And that's the only way to access it or? [[03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10992.119999999999s)]
*  Maybe. [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10994.68s)]
*  Some people say you can access it through Kundalini yoga. [[03:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10995.24s)]
*  I've never done it that way, [[03:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10998.52s)]
*  but I have done what they call holotropic breathing. [[03:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=10999.64s)]
*  I've had psychedelic experiences just from breathing. [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11003.24s)]
*  You can get to like an acid state just breathing. [[03:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11006.199999999999s)]
*  It's really wild. [[03:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11009.72s)]
*  But the physical process of dying, [[03:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11011.24s)]
*  when people have near death experiences, [[03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11020.68s)]
*  it sounds a lot like a psychedelic trip. [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11023.16s)]
*  A lot of these people that go to the light and then come back, [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11026.84s)]
*  they die for 30 seconds and then they come back [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11029.96s)]
*  and they have this crazy experience [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11033.24s)]
*  of interacting with beings and interacting with angels [[03:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11035.4s)]
*  and interacting with devils. [[03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11039.0s)]
*  Weird shit, man. [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11041.16s)]
*  And a lot of them have these weird stories. [[03:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11042.84s)]
*  And they've tried to like map out what the fuck is happening [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11045.960000000001s)]
*  with the human mind while that's going on. [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11049.32s)]
*  But it's just a lot of speculation in terms of like, [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11051.16s)]
*  they didn't even know like what part of the brain [[03:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11054.52s)]
*  is producing this chemical. [[03:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11056.76s)]
*  They knew it's produced by the liver [[03:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11058.12s)]
*  and I think it's produced by the lungs. [[03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11060.36s)]
*  But like they think it's produced by the whole brain now. [[03:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11062.12s)]
*  Isn't that what Strassman said the last time he was here? [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11065.560000000001s)]
*  But your brain makes the most potent psychedelic drug [[03:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11068.119999999999s)]
*  known to man. [[03:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11071.16s)]
*  That's one of the reasons why that stuff is such a short, [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11072.84s)]
*  like the time that you're, if you take DMT, [[03:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11076.84s)]
*  your body brings it back to baseline very quickly. [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11079.4s)]
*  Like how long? [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11081.8s)]
*  You're blasted for 10, 15 minutes and then you're back. [[03:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11082.599999999999s)]
*  Huh. [[03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11085.32s)]
*  And you're stone cold sober. [[03:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11086.199999999999s)]
*  And you were just in another dimension. [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11088.359999999999s)]
*  That's crazy. [[03:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11089.64s)]
*  It's boneless. [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11090.439999999999s)]
*  And you're back to the party. [[03:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11091.56s)]
*  And here's what's even more crazy. [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11092.599999999999s)]
*  You have a really hard time remembering it. [[03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11094.279999999999s)]
*  You had one of the most insane experiences [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11095.96s)]
*  you could ever possibly imagine. [[03:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11097.4s)]
*  You remember little snippets of it, just like a dream. [[03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11098.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm like that. [[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11100.759999999998s)]
*  I'm bad at remembering dreams. [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11101.8s)]
*  You actually get a journal or something. [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11103.8s)]
*  Everybody is. [[03:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11105.16s)]
*  Everybody is. [[03:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11106.039999999999s)]
*  And that is like a function of that same thing [[03:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11106.919999999998s)]
*  that when you take the actual chemical, [[03:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11110.359999999999s)]
*  when you take the actual DMT molecule, [[03:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11112.679999999998s)]
*  it's the same thing that happens. [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11114.759999999998s)]
*  You have a very difficult time holding on to those memories [[03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11116.279999999999s)]
*  because memories are weird anyway. [[03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11119.56s)]
*  You know, we all have false memories. [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11121.32s)]

*  You have an approximation of things. [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11127.16s)]
*  I'm jealous. [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11129.880000000001s)]
*  Some people have iron trap memories. [[03:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11130.36s)]
*  I'll talk to a buddy and he'll bring up an event [[03:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11131.960000000001s)]
*  from six years ago. [[03:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11134.76s)]

*  Some people just have super memories like that. [[03:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11138.52s)]
*  They definitely do with some things. [[03:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11140.76s)]
*  You know, I'd always wonder, like, [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11143.08s)]
*  do they have less experiences in their life? [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11144.36s)]
*  So is that like more memorable because they don't have [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11146.2s)]
*  anything that stands out from the norm? [[03:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11149.0s)]
*  I think just the way their brain processes information [[03:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11150.84s)]
*  and events like it has a better filing system or something. [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11153.48s)]
*  Well, some people definitely have photographic memories. [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11156.119999999999s)]
*  Like they can remember everything absolutely perfectly. [[03:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11158.439999999999s)]

*  about like she's one of these people with super memory. [[03:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11168.52s)]
*  Super memory. [[03:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11171.16s)]
*  Yeah, like very different than normal good memory. [[03:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11171.96s)]
*  Even people who can remember lines very easily. [[03:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11174.6s)]

*  I know that's crazy. [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11184.28s)]

*  for brain research. [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11195.560000000001s)]
*  That's insane. [[03:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11196.52s)]
*  That's incredible. [[03:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11198.04s)]
*  It's a super human gift. [[03:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11198.68s)]
*  When you hear her like recite things that she can remember, [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11199.32s)]
*  it's bananas. [[03:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11203.16s)]

*  For sure. [[03:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11208.92s)]

*  I know exactly what you're going to say, [[03:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11211.32s)]

*  Everyone's process is different too, [[03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11222.36s)]
*  how to retain that, just going over it. [[03:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11223.88s)]
*  For me, it was always just repetition. [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11225.48s)]
*  You have to do a lot of repetition over and over and over again. [[03:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11227.4s)]
*  Say it out loud, write it down. [[03:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11229.88s)]

*  He's in Sound of Music or Sound of Metal. [[03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11239.08s)]
*  Two very different movies, by the way. [[03:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11242.68s)]
*  I know. [[03:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11244.04s)]
*  He was in Sound of Music or the Sound of Metal. [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11245.56s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it was Sound of Metal. [[03:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11248.92s)]
*  But he's a super talented actor. [[03:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11250.36s)]
*  And I heard he like runs while he does his lines [[03:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11252.44s)]
*  and just to get himself out of his. [[03:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11255.16s)]
*  Wasn't he in Oppenheimer? [[03:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11256.68s)]
*  Was he? [[03:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11258.36s)]
*  I feel like everyone was in Oppenheimer. [[03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11259.0s)]
*  Oppenheimer is a damn good movie. [[03:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11260.2s)]
*  How crazy is it they went after him for communism? [[03:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11262.28s)]
*  I don't think I was thinking of somebody else. [[03:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11264.44s)]
*  What was that? [[03:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11265.16s)]
*  How crazy is it they went after him for communism? [[03:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11265.72s)]
*  Oh, that's what they got him on? [[03:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11267.72s)]
*  That's what they're going after him for. [[03:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11269.0s)]
*  That was the thing, dude. [[03:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11270.84s)]
*  They get you. [[03:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11272.2s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean, the guy who invented the fucking bomb. [[03:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11273.16s)]
*  Leave him alone. [[03:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11277.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11277.8s)]
*  Leave him alone. [[03:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11279.72s)]
*  What if the movie ended after they dropped the bomb [[03:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11280.6s)]
*  and everyone cheers and then you see the credits? [[03:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11282.12s)]
*  Yay, everybody died. [[03:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11284.04s)]
*  Yeah, but you saw they had to do that back end [[03:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11286.04s)]
*  where he felt bad and shit. [[03:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11287.96s)]
*  Of course. [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11289.16s)]
*  He's like, what have I done? [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11289.56s)]
*  One of my favorite all time videos, [[03:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11291.0s)]
*  let's leave it on this, is the Oppenheimer video [[03:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11292.84s)]
*  of him describing what he said when the first bomb went off, [[03:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11296.36s)]
*  when he quoted the Bhagavad Gita. [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11300.12s)]
*  We'll leave with this. [[03:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11303.24s)]
*  Fahim, you're the fucking man. [[03:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11304.04s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11305.24s)]
*  Appreciate you. [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11305.560000000001s)]
*  Love you to death. [[03:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11306.28s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[03:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11307.0s)]
*  I miss you. [[03:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11307.480000000001s)]
*  Your new comedy special. [[03:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11308.76s)]

*  and always the Comedy Store. [[03:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11322.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11324.119999999999s)]
*  Oppenheimer. [[03:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11325.4s)]
*  Shit. [[03:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11329.0s)]
*  We knew the world would not be the same. [[03:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11330.199999999999s)]
*  Few people laughed. [[03:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11335.4s)]
*  Few people cried. [[03:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11339.56s)]
*  Most people were silent. [[03:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11341.72s)]
*  I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, [[03:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11346.599999999999s)]
*  the Bhagavad Gita. [[03:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11350.519999999999s)]
*  Vishnu is trying to persuade the prince that [[03:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11353.96s)]
*  he should do his duty and to impress him, [[03:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11361.96s)]
*  takes on his multi-armed form and says, [[03:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11367.0s)]
*  now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds. [[03:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11372.439999999999s)]
*  I suppose we all thought that one way or another. [[03:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11379.16s)]
*  That's a quote. [[03:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11384.759999999998s)]
*  Bars. [[03:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11386.599999999999s)]
*  That's a bar. [[03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11387.72s)]
*  Somebody put some hip hop beat underneath it. [[03:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11388.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it probably is already in a song. [[03:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11390.119999999999s)]
*  That's a good point. [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11391.8s)]
*  That should be in a Wu-Tang song. [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11392.119999999999s)]
*  All right. [[03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11393.72s)]
*  Goodbye, everybody. [[03:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQO0ohBq6Vk&t=11394.119999999999s)]
