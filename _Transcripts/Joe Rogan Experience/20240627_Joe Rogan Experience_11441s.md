# Joe Rogan Experience #1934 - Lex Fridman
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6.0s)]
*  What's up brother? How are you? Good to see you my friend. Good to see you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=12.0s)]
*  Hey, what have your people done? You're AI people with this fucking chat GPT shit. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=15.0s)]
*  This scares the fuck out of me. It's your people. What do you mean? Your people. Your AI people. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=19.0s)]
*  Your wacky coders. What have you done? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=24.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's super interesting. Language models, I don't know if you know what those are, but that's the general [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=27.0s)]
*  systems that underlie chat GPT and GPT. They've been progressing over the past maybe four years aggressively. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=32.0s)]
*  There's been a lot of development. GPT-1, GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-3.5. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=42.0s)]
*  And chat GPT, there's a lot of interesting technical stuff that maybe we don't want to get into. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=48.0s)]
*  Sure, let's get into it. I'm fascinated by it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=53.0s)]
*  So chat GPT is based on fundamentally on a 175 billion parameter neural network that is GPT-3. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=56.0s)]
*  And the rest is what data is it trained on and how is it trained. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=66.0s)]
*  So you already have like a brain, a giant neural network, and it's just trained in different ways. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=71.0s)]
*  So chat GPT-3 came out about two years ago and it was like impressive but dumb in a lot of ways. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=75.0s)]
*  It was like you would expect as a human being for it to generate certain kinds of text and it was like [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=84.0s)]
*  saying kind of dumb things that were off. You know, like, all right, this is really impressive, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=89.0s)]
*  but it's not quite there. You can tell it's not intelligent. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=93.0s)]
*  And what they did with GPT-3.5 is they started adding more and different kinds of data sets there. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=96.0s)]
*  One of them, probably the smartest neural network currently is Codex, which is fine tuned for programming. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=105.0s)]
*  It was trained on code, on programming code. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=113.0s)]
*  And when you train on programming code, which chat GPT is also, you're teaching it something like reasoning. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=116.0s)]
*  Because it's no longer information and knowledge from the Internet. It's also reasoning. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=123.0s)]
*  You can like logic, even though you're looking at code, programming code is you're looking at me like, what the fuck is he talking about? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=128.0s)]
*  No, no, no, that's not what I'm looking at. I'm looking at you like, oh my God. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=135.0s)]
*  But reasoning is a in order to be able to stitch together sentences that make sense. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=138.0s)]
*  You not only need to know the facts that underlie those sentences, you also have to be able to reason. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=143.0s)]
*  And we think of it, we take it for granted as human beings that we can do some common sense reasoning. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=148.0s)]
*  Like this war started at this date and ended at this date. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=154.0s)]
*  Therefore, it means that like the start and the end has a meaning. There's a temporal consistency. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=158.0s)]
*  There's a cause and effect. All of those things are inside programming code. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=165.0s)]
*  By the way, a lot of stuff I'm saying, we still don't understand. We're like intuiting why this works so well. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=169.0s)]
*  Really? These are the intuitions. Yeah, there's a lot of stuff that not clear. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=175.0s)]
*  So chat. So GPT 3.5, which chat GPT is likely based on. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=179.0s)]
*  There's no paper yet, so we don't know exactly the details. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=185.0s)]
*  But it was just trained on code and more data that's able to give it some reasoning. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=188.0s)]
*  Then this is really important. It was fine tuned in a supervised way by human labeling, small data set by human labeling of here's what we would like this network to generate. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=196.0s)]
*  Here's the stuff that makes sense. Here's the kind of dialogue that makes sense. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=208.0s)]
*  Here's the kind of answers to questions that make sense. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=212.0s)]
*  It's basically pointing this giant Titanic of a neural network into the right direction that aligns with the way human beings think and talk. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=215.0s)]
*  So it's not just using the giant wisdom of Wikipedia and I can talk about what data sets is trained on, but just basically the Internet. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=224.0s)]
*  It was pointed in the wrong direction. So this supervised labeling allows it to point in the right direction to when it says shit, you're like, holy shit, that's pretty smart. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=233.0s)]
*  So that's the alignment. And then they did something really interesting is using reinforcement learning. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=242.0s)]
*  Based on labeling data from humans, that's quite a large data set. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=247.0s)]
*  The task is the following. You have the smart GPT 3.5 thing, generate a bunch of text and humans label which one seems the best. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=254.0s)]
*  So ranking. Like you ask it a question. For example, you could do generate a joke in the style of Joe Rogan. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=265.0s)]
*  And you have a label, they have five options, and you have a label. Does it mention dick and pussy? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=272.0s)]
*  I don't know how exactly, but you get it to rank. The human label is just sitting there. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=278.0s)]
*  There's a very large number of them. They're working full time. They're labeling the ranking of the outputs of this model. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=288.0s)]
*  And that kind of ranking, used together with a technique called reinforcement learning, is able to get this thing to generate very impressive to humans output. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=294.0s)]
*  So it's not actually, there's not a significant breakthrough in how much knowledge was learned. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=303.0s)]
*  That was already in GPT 3 and there was much more impressive models already trained. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=308.0s)]
*  So it's on the way, not just open AI. But this kind of fine-tuning, it's called, by human labelers plus reinforcement learning, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=313.0s)]
*  you start to get like where students don't have to write essays anymore in high school, where you can style transfer, like I said, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=322.0s)]
*  do a Louis C.K. joke in the style of Joe Rogan or Joe Rogan joke in the style of Louis C.K. and it does an incredible job at those kinds of style transfers. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=331.0s)]
*  It can more accurately query things about the different historical events, all that kind of stuff. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=342.0s)]
*  Holy shit, man. The idea that you don't exactly know why it works the way it works, that's too close to human. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=348.0s)]
*  That's too close to human thinking. Like, you know what this is eerily similar to? The plot of Ex Machina. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=357.0s)]
*  When he's talking about how he coated the brain, do you remember that plot, that scene? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=365.0s)]
*  That scene when he was, yeah, no. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=371.0s)]
*  The gentleman, what's the gentleman's name? The actor, that dude's badass. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=373.0s)]
*  Oscar Isaac? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=377.0s)]
*  Isaac. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=379.0s)]
*  Great casting. He's amazing. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=380.0s)]
*  Alex Garland, the director. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=383.0s)]
*  Oscar Isaac. He's in Star Wars and shit, too. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=385.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, that movie is one of my top tens. I love that movie. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=388.0s)]
*  But that scene where he's... [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=392.0s)]
*  Below John Wick 1, 2 and 3? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=394.0s)]
*  Well, 3 of us, I'm not a fan of 3. 3 didn't have any muscle cars. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=396.0s)]
*  Still worse than Sent of a Woman. Gone. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=400.0s)]
*  It's worse than Sent of a Woman. Which one, John Wick 3 or 1? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=403.0s)]
*  All of them. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=407.0s)]
*  How dare you? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=408.0s)]
*  All of them. It's Silly Man movies. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=409.0s)]
*  Yeah, you ever watch them when you're on a treadmill, though? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=412.0s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=414.0s)]
*  Gives you motivation. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=415.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=416.0s)]
*  It's constant action. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=417.0s)]
*  You ever watch them a hundred times on a treadmill? Which apparently you have. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=420.0s)]
*  Well, I was trying to win a bet. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=424.0s)]
*  Alright. Rocky is better, I think, for that. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=426.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=429.0s)]
*  I'm a sucker for Rocky. The whole soundtrack, the... [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=430.0s)]
*  I can't get over the bad fight scenes. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=433.0s)]
*  Oh, the bad fight scenes. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=436.0s)]
*  I can't. My disconnect, it won't allow that. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=437.0s)]
*  Have you seen the montages recently? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=441.0s)]
*  No. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=443.0s)]
*  They're cheesy as hell and they still work. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=444.0s)]
*  Because he's doing the kind of fitness he's doing. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=446.0s)]
*  He's doing pull-ups and he's doing the silliest of stuff, even Drago. It's silly. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=448.0s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=453.0s)]
*  It's just... there's so much corny to the actual physical confrontations. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=454.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=460.0s)]
*  Like as an analyst. I'm like, come on. It doesn't work like this. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=461.0s)]
*  Which is the interesting thing about Ex Machina, for me, as somebody who knows about AI and robotics, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=465.0s)]
*  the corny signal doesn't... [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=472.0s)]
*  This is the one when he's in Russia, doing the old school training. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=474.0s)]
*  Running in the snow. Jogging in the snow. And that's supposed to be badass. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=478.0s)]
*  And then the other dude, Drago, is using machines and computers and shit. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=482.0s)]
*  That's what he's been doing. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=486.0s)]
*  That's where I found out about the VersaClimber. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=488.0s)]
*  I'm like, that's gotta be the most fucking high-tech way to work out ever. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=490.0s)]
*  We have one of those. They're the shit. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=493.0s)]
*  You ever use one? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=495.0s)]
*  No. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=496.0s)]
*  It's brutal. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=497.0s)]
*  They're hard. But that movie's dumb as shit. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=498.0s)]
*  Fuck out of here. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=500.0s)]
*  Oh, look. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=501.0s)]
*  I like, though, cold exposure, doing a little crawling, pulling sleds. All good. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=502.0s)]
*  See how they mimic each other? One of them's old school. Old school's always better. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=506.0s)]
*  Yeah, you don't want computers, technology and shit. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=513.0s)]
*  You want to do it with a log out there in the fucking snow, doing press-ups. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=516.0s)]
*  Yeah. But technology can mimic that. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=520.0s)]
*  Can mimic the romance of nature and humanness. That's the whole point. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=523.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=528.0s)]
*  That's what Ex Machina is doing, right? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=529.0s)]
*  Yes, that's what's scary. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=530.0s)]
*  And then in this, well, that scene where she gets him to fall in love with her, it's so creepy. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=531.0s)]
*  When she comes back with clothes on and she's got a wig and you're like, oh my god. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=539.0s)]
*  Like, it's so subtle. Like, it's so well done. The scene is so well done. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=544.0s)]
*  But that's what Chad GPD's doing. They're real close. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=548.0s)]
*  Duncan sent me a series. Of course he did. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=553.0s)]
*  He's using it right now. While we're talking, I'm sure Duncan's on it. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=557.0s)]
*  But he sent me this series of jokes that were done. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=561.0s)]
*  One, me talking about aliens. Sounded exactly like how I would talk. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=565.0s)]
*  And then it was Mitch Hedberg doing a joke about something. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=570.0s)]
*  And you could ask it to do different ones. Oh yeah, here it is. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=574.0s)]
*  Okay. Yeah, oh. So you could do a Mitch Hedberg joke. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=580.0s)]
*  It goes, I was going to stay overnight at my friend's place. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=585.0s)]
*  He said, you're going to have to sleep on the floor. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=589.0s)]
*  Damn gravity. You got me again. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=593.0s)]
*  You know how badly I want to sleep on the wall? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=597.0s)]
*  That sounds exactly like a Mitch Hedberg joke. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=600.0s)]
*  That's a pretty good joke or a good start of a joke. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=602.0s)]
*  That's exactly like a Mitch Hedberg joke. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=604.0s)]
*  That's creepy as fuck, man. That's creepy as fuck. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=606.0s)]
*  Maybe you could give it to bands when they fall off. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=612.0s)]
*  Like you lose something, you're losing something, guys. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=615.0s)]
*  You've got to get back to what you were before. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=618.0s)]
*  You guys had a hunger in 1978. For whatever reason, it slipped through your fingers. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=620.0s)]
*  Like Rolling Stones songs. Just imagine, if GPT wrote it, if they perform it, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=627.0s)]
*  and they don't rewrite anything, I bet you they can have some hits. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=632.0s)]
*  The Stones stayed strong with great new songs deep in the 80s. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=636.0s)]
*  You really got to be...they probably like... [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=642.0s)]
*  Who's like the most prolific of those mega bands? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=645.0s)]
*  In terms of duration? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=649.0s)]
*  Yeah, the most prolific in terms of also new songs and new albums. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=652.0s)]
*  The audio is a little weird. It's like robotic. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=656.0s)]
*  What audio? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=659.0s)]
*  Maybe it's through the headphones. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=660.0s)]
*  This one that we're listening to right now? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=662.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=663.0s)]
*  It's you, bro. Your fucking circuits are rewired. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=664.0s)]
*  You've got a new programming. You're not used to it. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=667.0s)]
*  It's kind of cool, actually. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=670.0s)]
*  I don't hear it at all. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=672.0s)]
*  I feel like it's in the 80s video. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=673.0s)]
*  How far away are we from something like chat GPT being impossible to detect? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=675.0s)]
*  Whether or not it's a person or whether it's chat GPT. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=684.0s)]
*  Well, it depends who is playing with it. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=687.0s)]
*  I think we're not that far away in terms of capability, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=690.0s)]
*  but in order to use these systems and rather in order to train these systems, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=693.0s)]
*  you have to be a large company. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=698.0s)]
*  And large companies tend to get scared when it's doing interesting stuff. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=700.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=706.0s)]
*  Well, they tend to want to...even currently with chat GPT, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=707.0s)]
*  it's become a lot less interesting. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=710.0s)]
*  Interesting spoken in a Bukowski, Hunter S. Thompson kind of interesting [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=712.0s)]
*  because the companies are kind of censoring it. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=716.0s)]
*  You don't want it to have any kind of controversial opinions. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=719.0s)]
*  You don't want it to be too edgy. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=722.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=724.0s)]
*  You don't want it to be too...like if I ask it, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=725.0s)]
*  how do I build the bomb because I want to destroy the world? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=727.0s)]
*  You want it to prevent that. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=730.0s)]
*  How do I convince...I don't know anything about this, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=732.0s)]
*  but how do I convince a dude or a girl to sleep with me? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=737.0s)]
*  Like anything, I'm just off the top of my head. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=741.0s)]
*  Anything, you start to get nervous. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=744.0s)]
*  I mean, if you're a company, how do I want people to use this kind of system? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=746.0s)]
*  Especially because it's basically an assistant that gives you wisdom about the world, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=750.0s)]
*  gives you knowledge about the world. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=754.0s)]
*  It could be like, how do I replace a carburetor? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=756.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's great. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=758.0s)]
*  It'll just answer you like a person. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=759.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's great. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=761.0s)]
*  But then the... [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=762.0s)]
*  There it is. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=764.0s)]
*  I was trying to log in the whole time. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=765.0s)]
*  It was busy, which is another problem of it. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=767.0s)]
*  Well, it's probably...how many fucking people are using this? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=769.0s)]
*  Everybody. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=771.0s)]
*  Everybody's using this. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=772.0s)]
*  It's a little bit of a shock, because it's almost like the AI gives us its first messages. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=774.0s)]
*  It's like, remember the movie... [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=780.0s)]
*  What was the fucking movie with Matthew McConaughey and Jodie Foster? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=783.0s)]
*  Contact. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=789.0s)]
*  Remember Contact? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=790.0s)]
*  They get the first signals. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=792.0s)]
*  This is like the first signals from a real, general artificial intelligence. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=794.0s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=800.0s)]
*  The signal is blurry, and it's full of mystery. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=801.0s)]
*  We're not sure, is it really smart? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=803.0s)]
*  How much does it understand? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=806.0s)]
*  And then there's this emergent threshold with the size of the model. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=808.0s)]
*  If we make the model bigger, 175 billion parameters currently, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=812.0s)]
*  if you get it to 500, you get it to a trillion parameters, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=816.0s)]
*  so size of the network grows, size of the dataset grows. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=820.0s)]
*  Is there going to be a point where you're like, holy shit? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=823.0s)]
*  It will...what if it starts manipulating you with the answers? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=826.0s)]
*  It's going to. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=830.0s)]
*  It's going to manipulate world governments. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=831.0s)]
*  What can you do with that? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=833.0s)]
*  What can you do with it? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=834.0s)]
*  Once it's been implemented, once it's out there, once it's copied, it's going to be copied. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=835.0s)]
*  And that's the cool thing about this, I should say, that everyone kind of knows how to do this. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=841.0s)]
*  It's computationally difficult, but it's getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=847.0s)]
*  so it's not just going to be OpenAI with Microsoft or Google that's doing this. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=850.0s)]
*  It's basically anybody can do this. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=855.0s)]
*  So that, the distributed nature of our exploration of artificial intelligence, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=857.0s)]
*  I think if you believe that most people are good, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=863.0s)]
*  that we will not allow sort of a centralization of power, which is the big concern here, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=867.0s)]
*  whether that centralization of power leads to censorship or abuse of different kinds. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=873.0s)]
*  Centralization of power of AI, is that what you're saying? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=879.0s)]
*  Over an AI. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=882.0s)]
*  You have a superintelligence system. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=883.0s)]
*  Somebody is the first person that built it. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=885.0s)]
*  Imagine you're sitting there in a boardroom. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=888.0s)]
*  You have this thing you haven't released yet that is able to basically is a superintelligence, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=890.0s)]
*  able to answer any question, able to give you a plan of how to make a lot of money, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=899.0s)]
*  able to give you a plan how to manipulate other governments into any kind of geopolitical resolution [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=903.0s)]
*  that benefits you, all of that. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=913.0s)]
*  It's able to give you all of that. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=915.0s)]
*  And you can deploy it in a shady way where it sneaks into like TikTok or something like that. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=916.0s)]
*  It sneaks into everybody's smartphone, pretending to be doing good, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=923.0s)]
*  but it's actually, whether deliberately or not, is controlling the population. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=928.0s)]
*  So that capability is there. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=933.0s)]
*  The great thing is the people at the head of OpenAI currently, Sam Altman and others, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=936.0s)]
*  really care about this problem. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=943.0s)]
*  They were there in the beginning. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=945.0s)]
*  They were the ones like Elon screaming about AI ethics, AI alignment. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=946.0s)]
*  They're really concerned about superintelligence AI taking over. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=951.0s)]
*  So glad they're concerned while they're building it. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=954.0s)]
*  Well, you'd rather have the stuff. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=956.0s)]
*  What is going on here, Jamie? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=959.0s)]
*  These aren't real people. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=961.0s)]
*  What? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=962.0s)]
*  Yeah. So these pictures are going around. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=963.0s)]
*  A lot of them look very similar to me, which is kind of weird. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=965.0s)]
*  I'm sure Lex can explain that part of it, but I am not explaining any of this. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=967.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=971.0s)]
*  So these are completely 3D CGI made people. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=972.0s)]
*  Not 3D. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=977.0s)]
*  So like photo, very photo realistic, if not photo realistic, but like there are, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=979.0s)]
*  when you look real close, you can see some weird things going on. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=984.0s)]
*  Like the background here is a little messed up. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=987.0s)]
*  This arm is not to the right person. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=989.0s)]
*  She's sitting on an extra piece of skin here somehow. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=992.0s)]
*  I see you've analyzed this carefully. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=995.0s)]
*  Well, me and my friends have been passing this around because it's too tricky. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=996.0s)]
*  No, no, no. Listen, you're incorrect. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=998.0s)]
*  That arm is in perfect purpose. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1000.0s)]
*  It's just there's a string from that other girl's bikini on it. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1002.0s)]
*  The analysis continues. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1005.0s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1006.0s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1007.0s)]
*  Is that a string? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1008.0s)]
*  No, I think you're right. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1009.0s)]
*  I think it's a fold. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1010.0s)]
*  Zoom in on that spot. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1011.0s)]
*  For people just listening. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1012.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1013.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1014.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's nonsense. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1015.0s)]
*  We're looking at. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1016.0s)]
*  The hand goes the wrong way. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1017.0s)]
*  Oh, that's wild. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1018.0s)]
*  There's already apparently the only fans accounts that are being taken over and being tricked [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1019.0s)]
*  by guys running them. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1022.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1023.0s)]
*  It's just these kind of fake girls that aren't real people. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1024.0s)]
*  What? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1028.0s)]
*  These are all fake? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1029.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1030.0s)]
*  Like look at the, like even that's not a real door kind of to begin with. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1031.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1034.0s)]
*  The hands or the fingers here a little off. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1035.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1037.0s)]
*  And so this is right now just still images and eventually it'll be film. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1038.0s)]
*  Eventually it'll be unrecognizable. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1041.0s)]
*  You won't be able to discern whether or not it's an actual person. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1044.0s)]
*  I mean in terms of obviously much of human civilization is driven by sex. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1047.0s)]
*  I mean there was a time we didn't have easily accessible porn. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1051.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1054.0s)]
*  And that changed a lot. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1055.0s)]
*  I don't think we've actually quite caught up to how much he's changed the nature of [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1056.0s)]
*  human civilization. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1060.0s)]
*  Just easily accessible porn. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1061.0s)]
*  Yeah, I talk about it on stage right now. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1063.0s)]
*  It's very weird. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1065.0s)]
*  It's very weird for kids. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1066.0s)]
*  You really think about what's happening with kids. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1069.0s)]
*  Like any kid that has a smartphone. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1071.0s)]
*  People just leave their, give your kid a phone, just leave them alone. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1073.0s)]
*  Like they just go, they go to school, they go to their friend's house. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1076.0s)]
*  They have that phone independently of you. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1079.0s)]
*  They can look at whatever the fuck they want. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1081.0s)]
*  Some of the shit that I see just on Instagram, I don't know how these guys are doing it. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1083.0s)]
*  And I don't know how it's getting recommended in my feed, but it's like videos of people [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1087.0s)]
*  getting murdered. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1091.0s)]
*  You know, you see a lot of those? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1092.0s)]
*  Simulated porn. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1094.0s)]
*  I haven't seen that. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1096.0s)]
*  I haven't seen that. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1097.0s)]
*  It's true stuff. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1098.0s)]
*  Well, I am. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1099.0s)]
*  You and I have different algorithms. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1100.0s)]
*  You fucking creep. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1101.0s)]
*  But then someone gets taken down for something that's like, they call it porn and it's not [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1102.0s)]
*  porn or something. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1107.0s)]
*  Like, whoa, do you guys not see what else is on this platform? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1108.0s)]
*  I think, right, that what's going on is that they're managing at scale. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1110.0s)]
*  I think it's virtually impossible to stop all that stuff from coming in. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1114.0s)]
*  And people that have individual situations where people get banned. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1118.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know why they're getting banned. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1122.0s)]
*  Are they getting banned because of an algorithm? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1124.0s)]
*  Are they getting banned because they post misinformation or what are they getting banned [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1126.0s)]
*  for? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1132.0s)]
*  Harassment photos. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1133.0s)]
*  Someone was joking about a friend, you know, like they get reported. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1135.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know how it's all working when it breaks down to individual circumstances. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1138.0s)]
*  You had a good conversation with Jordan Peterson. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1143.0s)]
*  He was talking about the more you have this kind of virtualization, the more you allow [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1145.0s)]
*  the psychopaths to reign free. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1150.0s)]
*  So like the more we have artificially generated porn, the more we have artificially generated [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1153.0s)]
*  violence, photorealistic violence, the more you make it normal for you to be basically [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1159.0s)]
*  a psychopath in a digital space. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1166.0s)]
*  Enable that and make that okay and then you forget what it's like to actually be a good [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1168.0s)]
*  human being. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1173.0s)]
*  And then also part of the problem may be that we may very well be looking at a world, whether [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1174.0s)]
*  it's 10 years from now, 20 years from now, whatever it is, where these children that [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1179.0s)]
*  have grown up in this environment now have a completely different way of looking at people [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1183.0s)]
*  in the world because of all these interactions they have. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1188.0s)]
*  It's flavored their personality. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1191.0s)]
*  And then we move into a digital world. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1193.0s)]
*  I mean, we're not there yet in terms of virtual reality. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1197.0s)]
*  It's not good enough. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1201.0s)]
*  I mean, I think that's what we're seeing with the meta failure. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1203.0s)]
*  People were expecting a lot of people were just going to dive in and start wearing goggles all [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1206.0s)]
*  over the house. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1210.0s)]
*  But it's not quite there yet. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1211.0s)]
*  There's also something weird for people. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1213.0s)]
*  There's something really weird about wearing these head goggles and it's really fun. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1215.0s)]
*  I really enjoy the boxing games. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1220.0s)]
*  You ever done any of them? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1222.0s)]
*  No, in VR, no. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1224.0s)]
*  They're great. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1225.0s)]
*  You get a workout. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1226.0s)]
*  You legitimately get a workout because you're actually sparring against like a computer [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1227.0s)]
*  character throwing punches at you. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1230.0s)]
*  You're moving your head. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1232.0s)]
*  And so you have these things in your hands and you get tired. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1233.0s)]
*  It's good. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1236.0s)]
*  Feels realistic. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1237.0s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1238.0s)]
*  You know, when you get hit with a punch, your face lights up. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1239.0s)]
*  You get a flash of light, which is kind of cool because you're like, oh, Jesus. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1242.0s)]
*  You feel it like you're getting hit. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1246.0s)]
*  There's some really fun games. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1248.0s)]
*  There's one where you walk a plank across these two buildings and you hear the wind whistle and shit. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1249.0s)]
*  That one is terrifying. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1254.0s)]
*  There's zombie ones. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1255.0s)]
*  There's a lot of cool ones. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1256.0s)]
*  But people are just not buying into it the way they buy into Xbox and PlayStation. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1257.0s)]
*  They're not they're not like wholesale committed to this yet, but they will be. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1262.0s)]
*  It's going to it's going to be so fucking good that instead of like having it in a goggle form [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1266.0s)]
*  or it's like this big clunky thing on you, it's going to be very easy to do. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1273.0s)]
*  When they get to that. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1277.0s)]
*  I've been revisiting some classic books recently. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1278.0s)]
*  Just doing a reading list and one of them that captures this extremely well that I recommend. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1283.0s)]
*  I think most people read in like middle school or something, but it's actually very relevant. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1287.0s)]
*  It's Brave New World. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1291.0s)]
*  So a lot of people, including Jordan Peterson, worry about 1984, sort of a totalitarian, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1292.0s)]
*  a dystopia that represents a totalitarian state. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1299.0s)]
*  But Brave New World has a there's no centralized government that's like dogmatic and controlling everything, surveilling everything. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1302.0s)]
*  They're basically created this world where sex is easy, everyone's promiscuous. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1310.0s)]
*  Genetic engineering removes any kind of diversity, any kind of interesting, dark, bad diversity that we would think of, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1318.0s)]
*  like the Hunter S. Thompson's and the Bukowski's, the weirdos of society. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1326.0s)]
*  And then he gives you drugs, Soma, that basically gives you pleasure whenever you want. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1332.0s)]
*  If you start feeling a little too shitty about your life. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1338.0s)]
*  And that's actually closer to us, closer to us. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1341.0s)]
*  And it doesn't seem if you, I mean, the way he writes about it, it sounds bad. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1344.0s)]
*  Like we don't want that. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1349.0s)]
*  But then you're like, you start to ask a question like, well, at which point would we realize it's bad? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1350.0s)]
*  Because it's constantly obviously we should do generic engineering to remove any kind of like maladies that we have, any kind of diseases. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1356.0s)]
*  It's like everything is an obvious step forward. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1364.0s)]
*  But then the place you end up at, just like with sex, like is it good to have artificial images of as many as you want, as much porn as you want, as much sex as you want? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1366.0s)]
*  Is that good? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1376.0s)]
*  As much awesome stuff as you want? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1377.0s)]
*  Is that good? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1379.0s)]
*  Is that what human flourishing looks like? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1380.0s)]
*  Or do you want to have some constraints, some limitations, some finiteness of resources, some scarcity? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1381.0s)]
*  Maybe that's actually fundamental for human happiness. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1387.0s)]
*  Having too much of awesome stuff, maybe that destroys the possibility of real, meaningful, deep happiness. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1391.0s)]
*  It certainly does. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1397.0s)]
*  But I think the question really becomes, are we going to stay people? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1398.0s)]
*  Because I don't think we are. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1402.0s)]
*  I think we're moving in that general direction anyway. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1404.0s)]
*  I think that probably is why we have this. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1406.0s)]
*  I mean, it's almost inevitable if you have this addiction to cell phone issue, because everybody has that. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1409.0s)]
*  If you have a cell phone and you're on your social media apps during the day and you're on YouTube, you're probably addicted, whether you realize it or not. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1416.0s)]
*  And the number of hours that you put on those things is shocking. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1423.0s)]
*  When you actually look at your screen time, you're like, six hours? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1428.0s)]
*  I was on my phone for six hours? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1431.0s)]
*  What the fuck did I do? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1433.0s)]
*  And you'll try to rationalize it and justify it. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1434.0s)]
*  But what that's doing to young people has got to be very strange. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1437.0s)]
*  And if that, along with all the contaminants that are affecting the way people develop, which are Dr. Shanna Swan from the book Countdown talks about this, talks about phthalates and plastics and how you can trace back to the 1950s when they really started using a lot of plastics and petrochemical products that started getting into people's bodies, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1442.0s)]
*  in the form of phthalates, it started diminishing sperm count and smaller penises and testicles and taints and more miscarriages for women, lower fertility rates. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1461.0s)]
*  All that, she believes, is directly correlated with the data that they've done already on the data that they've collected. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1471.0s)]
*  When they do that to mammals in tests, the more phthalates they enter into their system, the more they have issues like this. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1479.0s)]
*  So we're becoming less able to procreate naturally. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1485.0s)]
*  And if we get to a point where the human race's future, the only way we're going to be able to procreate is some sort of genetic engineering and some sort of artificial womb or some sort of a system that they develop that allows you to do that. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1492.0s)]
*  That seems to me like if you were going to do that and you started engineering out very specific aspects of people that are problematic, anger, greed, jealousy, lust, or whatever, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1505.0s)]
*  you're going to be able to do that. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1514.0s)]
*  And I think that's something that's going to be a very important part of the process. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1518.0s)]
*  All these different things. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1524.0s)]
*  You would turn people into some sort of sexless thing that gets its pleasure by manipulating its neurochemistry through some electronics, through something. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1526.0s)]
*  Maybe it's something you take so they can control it. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1536.0s)]
*  But that's not far off from the way that you would turn people into sexless people. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1539.0s)]
*  If you really looked at where we're going now and if the fertility rates drop, if they really do. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1546.0s)]
*  And I know people a lot smarter than me are actually worried about, like Elon's worried about the amount of children that people have. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1552.0s)]
*  There was a thing today on Italy. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1560.0s)]
*  I was reading this article on Italy where they said, you know, if you're going to do this, you're going to have to do this. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1563.0s)]
*  And they're like, this is unsustainable. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1569.0s)]
*  You can only do this for so long before you know anybody live in there anymore. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1571.0s)]
*  And we don't think of that as being a possibility. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1575.0s)]
*  But it doesn't take that long. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1577.0s)]
*  If nobody has kids for there to be no more people left. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1579.0s)]
*  Like how many hundred years like if nobody has kids, hundreds of years from now, if nobody has kids, it's going to be a lot of people. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1582.0s)]
*  And I think that's a big part of the problem. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1588.0s)]
*  And I think that's a big part of the problem. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1590.0s)]
*  When you're getting out of the closet, you're stuffing yourself in dirt and you're really not going to always hit the ground. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1593.0s)]
*  You're really not going to As of right now. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1596.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1598.0s)]
*  Yeah, It makes sense. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1600.0s)]
*  And it made a very cool stuff for like social media and like rest of the world too. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1602.0s)]
*  Our friends are obviously schwierig. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1606.0s)]
*  But it pushes everyone up and bringing them down to live a healthy life. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1609.0s)]
*  You're you're fucking you're timing everything and and on top of that if you're not by the way still getting funny audio [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1613.0s)]
*  Every once in a while. That's weird [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1621.34s)]
*  Yeah, I just unplug it and pull it back in [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1625.42s)]
*  Sorry [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1628.54s)]

*  Oh, no, it's still dropping out dropping in [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1634.98s)]
*  Hmm interesting. Maybe we got a bad headphone. Once you grab that headphone right there [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1638.38s)]

*  Yeah, there must be a connection thing, but it's really pause and try to figure it out. We can do that for a second [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1687.48s)]
*  Okay, we'll pause. We'll be right back folks. It seems to be working now. Yeah, it seems to be working. So where were we? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=1692.2s)]

*  Why does it have to be like that like we have this idea in our head that this way we live is like ultimately [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2024.4s)]
*  Because to us it provides [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2030.96s)]
*  emotions and because it creates dilemmas and solutions and [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2033.0s)]
*  Conflict and resolution there's so much going on in our minds all the time when it comes to interacting with each other that we feel [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2038.4s)]
*  We feel like it's imperative for existence, but why it's just because it's the only way we've known [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2044.16s)]
*  You know we all you have to suffer in order, but but why do you have to suffer in order to be happy? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2049.82s)]
*  Wouldn't it be better if you're just happy? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2054.58s)]
*  Do we really fucking need to suffer couldn't that be engineered out now? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2057.02s)]
*  This is coming from a person who purposely suffers all the time so that I could stay happy and it does work [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2060.86s)]
*  But God do I have to do it that way well? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2065.94s)]
*  There's an incredible computation machine we call evolution that has constructed human beings [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2068.5s)]
*  You want to mess with that you want to get a bunch of you want to get a few software engineers from San Francisco? [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2073.18s)]
*  To mess yeah with the computation system that is evolution that is earth [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2079.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, this giant computer that for billions of years spent a billion years on bacteria [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2084.3s)]
*  Trying to figure shit out before it advanced and now it went through all of these incredible stages this entire [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2088.98s)]
*  Ecosystem that we call life on earth probably planted here by aliens [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2095.7400000000002s)]
*  That and and recently these monkeys started to get super clever [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2100.46s)]
*  Mm-hmm, and now we're going to completely change everything yes [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2104.86s)]
*  You know why why because that's a part of it [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2109.62s)]
*  Yeah, that is a part of evolution is the monkeys figuring out how to fuck with everything well [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2112.26s)]
*  That's probably why we haven't have any definitive evidence of aliens from out there [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2116.38s)]
*  Because the monkeys eventually start fucking with things and destroy themselves into starfish [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2121.28s)]
*  Whoops [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2127.46s)]
*  Yeah, you're super genius for like six months, and then you become a fucking jellyfish. I mean that's a threat [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2129.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, maybe word maybe I mean [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2134.02s)]
*  There's so many possible trajectories here that end up in what we would think of as boring [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2136.7599999999998s)]
*  I had a very interesting conversation with Eric Weinstein [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2141.72s)]
*  And we're gonna talk about it on the podcast from a physics standpoint this he's very [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2145.6s)]
*  Perplexed about the UFO thing and what's what's interesting is like he's one of those guys [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2152.4799999999996s)]
*  Like a lot of very smart people that were like it's all horseshit. It's all bullshit, but now he's come around to [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2157.52s)]
*  What the fuck is going on? What's his take well? He doesn't have a take necessarily [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2164.34s)]
*  But he's looking at all the data and all the evidence. We're gonna have like a whole long conversation, but about it [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2169.68s)]
*  But essentially there's one of two possibilities either this shit is coming from somewhere else, or it's coming from here [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2174.34s)]
*  so either we or someone has [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2181.18s)]
*  some real legitimate [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2185.46s)]
*  groundbreaking technology or [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2187.9s)]
*  Someone's visiting us from somewhere else. There's no if-and-or-butts [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2190.2000000000003s)]
*  It's one of the because now there's enough data that show that these things are moving in a way that they can't understand [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2193.36s)]
*  There's video that they're moving in a way. They can't can't understand. They're not showing a heat signature from visible means of propulsion [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2199.76s)]
*  It's not like a rocket. It's like whatever they're doing. They're doing something different [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2207.1600000000003s)]
*  And then commander David Fravor who you talked to that tic-tac experience [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2211.36s)]
*  If they really did track something that went from above [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2216.0600000000004s)]
*  50,000 feet above sea level to 50 feet in less than a second [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2219.78s)]
*  What the fuck is that like if that's real? We're assuming that all the the [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2223.78s)]
*  Their calibration was on and all their equipment worked together, but it was multiple different visual sightings of this thing, too [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2230.38s)]
*  different jetsaw different people [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2239.1800000000003s)]
*  Uniform story everybody's talked about how it just moved off at insane rates of speed [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2242.0s)]
*  And then there's all these other ones like Ryan Long and all these other people that he flew with that are seeing these similar [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2246.48s)]
*  Behaviors from these things where they just disappear they move off at insane rates of speed. So it's one of two things [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2252.92s)]
*  either [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2258.8s)]
*  He said there's been some sort of parallel science some science [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2260.0s)]
*  That's going on where nobody knew about it and all the top physicists were completely unaware of this tech and they were [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2263.48s)]
*  Developing it independently in some fucking lab in the mountains for the government or [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2269.62s)]
*  aliens or someone else or someone else there's a bunch of other options and one thing is I just talked to David kipping [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2275.1s)]
*  Just I highly recommend his YouTube channel cool worlds. He's a legit. That's like Huberman [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2282.3399999999997s)]
*  You sometimes get these like legit scientists who are also good communicators. They'll step up [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2288.5s)]
*  So he's a he's like the human of astronomy [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2293.54s)]
*  A young guy who probably have Mon eventually. I'm better. Sure. There's a lot mom. He's brilliant brilliant [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2298.2400000000002s)]
*  Jeff me check out a channel. Anyway, he [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2304.04s)]
*  This is an astronomer. So he's deep in the astronomy astrophysics community [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2307.04s)]
*  And he says and you've said this before too is he tries to really hard [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2310.46s)]
*  Not to think about stuff [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2316.44s)]
*  He wants to be true like a very kind of calibrated properly because with the UFO sightings [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2317.88s)]
*  There is a part of you [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2323.7s)]
*  I don't know why exactly but you kind of want it to be true not kinda like all the way [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2324.8599999999997s)]
*  98% of it to be true and there you have to be a little bit careful. But yeah, definitely like to me it [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2331.22s)]
*  feels like the [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2338.14s)]
*  Scientific development that we're doing now with Starship. So SpaceX and Starship with all the [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2339.8999999999996s)]
*  Advancement telescopes, which is getting more and more and more data to where we're not gonna have these shitty videos [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2346.22s)]
*  We're going to have high resolution [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2352.26s)]
*  understanding and [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2354.7s)]
*  Because it's becoming more. Okay to talk about aliens [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2356.54s)]
*  I think the actual scientific community has a bigger humility about the topic to where they're expanding of [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2359.06s)]
*  they're like the [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2367.42s)]
*  the window of their study to [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2370.02s)]
*  consider all kinds of physical phenomena all kinds of [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2373.7400000000002s)]
*  Observation all kinds of sources of data and signals and so on to where we would I mean [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2376.9s)]
*  I would hope we would get definitive signals of alien life. Yeah definitive definitive like when you when you [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2380.98s)]
*  Look at the capabilities of satellites today like satellite imagery [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2388.2200000000003s)]
*  how how good are they and [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2392.9s)]
*  how how many of them are up there that they could direct to a very specific area and get [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2395.78s)]
*  Really good video or photographs, I mean it's incredible. That's really really good [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2402.48s)]
*  So why wouldn't I link they're gonna cover the whole with you? [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2407.64s)]
*  You're talking about going from thousands to tens of thousands to potentially hundreds of thousands in in a couple of decades [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2411.0s)]
*  And would but are they capable of imagery the Starlink one? Yeah. Yes, they're all capable of imagery, but they're not that's not their purpose [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2417.88s)]
*  Right. It's it that's for internet. But what about for? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2425.44s)]
*  Visual when when they have spy satellites or satellites that can look down and see everything that's going on in the city [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2429.2999999999997s)]
*  How good are those they say they can read license plates from space? Yeah. Yeah, is that real? I think that's real [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2435.22s)]
*  Yeah, okay, how but how prevalent are they that's that? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2440.7s)]
*  I don't know because like the capability I think is there to high resolution image everything, but I don't know how much [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2443.8199999999997s)]
*  How much desire there is for that kind of application because there's so much more for other [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2453.18s)]
*  For other kinds of applications so like low resolution imaging for mapping purposes and so on [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2457.28s)]
*  Imaging for military purposes. There's applications, but that's like very [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2462.44s)]
*  specific kind of [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2466.76s)]
*  Application I just don't know [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2469.68s)]
*  It's it's it's like [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2471.8s)]
*  James Webb telescope, right? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2474.0s)]
*  There's like huge battles going on on what that thing should do because there's a lot of it's a constrained resource [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2475.56s)]
*  You have to battle what are the interesting questions? Where should it look? [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2481.6s)]
*  What kind of what's the resolution of data where in the sky should [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2484.14s)]
*  Collect that data how frequent and so on you know in that same kind of ways. There's probably [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2488.2999999999997s)]
*  Battles over satellite resources of what should it be sure especially with intelligence agencies and stuff [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2493.66s)]
*  Especially because the intelligence agencies are probably resisting this UFO stuff [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2499.58s)]
*  It's if I was an evil dictator, and I wanted to get my government [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2503.18s)]
*  To have control over the skies and to be able to see anything from anywhere at any time [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2509.2599999999998s)]
*  And I wanted to like have mass surveillance [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2514.14s)]
*  Drones in the sky above cities one a good way would be aliens [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2518.3399999999997s)]
*  But we have to capture these things on video, and there's only one way we're going to deploy these [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2522.74s)]
*  high resolution [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2527.7799999999997s)]
*  video cameras in the sky and capture everything and [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2529.5s)]
*  There's sightings every day won't be a matter of time before we have real high resolution photo of something [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2533.54s)]
*  We can definitively prove is not ours is not of this earth [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2540.34s)]
*  What do you think there's what sign the fuck up you think there's that much excitement about aliens? Okay? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2543.28s)]
*  Like it's ultimately why why are aliens so interesting because to me philosophic and scientifically it's a super interesting question like [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2548.2000000000003s)]
*  Just even the question are we alone? That's really exciting, but it's not [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2556.2000000000003s)]
*  Do you think people would vote to pay for that? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2560.36s)]
*  Versus to pay for you don't want them voting for that just do it [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2563.56s)]
*  Just okay, okay, just tell them it's imperative just like the fucking these these bills that get passed [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2567.08s)]
*  We're not voting on those bills right [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2574.4s)]
*  Representatives they just do it they just do it. They just put them in the sky with aliens are coming [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2576.94s)]
*  We got to do something people would that would be the new climate change. It's like aliens [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2580.9s)]
*  Oh, the aliens are coming and you're there with us against the aliens or you with the aliens [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2585.36s)]
*  What are you a fucking traitor? [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2591.1s)]
*  you're gonna give us up to the aliens you piece of shit and so there's gonna be some sort of a [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2592.46s)]
*  ideological conflict on earth whether or not [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2597.2400000000002s)]
*  We donate money to the defenses like the Democrats who want to defend against the aliens the Republicans are gonna be like hey [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2599.92s)]
*  Let's just hear him talk first and we have a fucking giant dilemma here. Yeah, I hope aliens are [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2606.6s)]
*  If they're out there, I hope they're detectable by us humans and we can interact with them probably not communicate with them, but [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2614.28s)]
*  From my perspective you have to be humble [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2623.0s)]
*  Advanced alien civilizations are probably so sophisticated that we dumb descendants of apes cannot possibly even detect them [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2626.56s)]
*  I have a feeling there's all sorts of ways that they could be and some of them could be [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2634.2s)]
*  Undetectable they're in talent. They might be made of light who knows [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2641.0s)]
*  But other ones are gonna be just a little bit ahead of us [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2644.28s)]
*  There's an infinite number of them and there's gonna be an infinite number of ones sure [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2646.52s)]
*  They will throw a thousand years ahead of us. You don't think they can get to us. Yeah space travel is really difficult [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2650.32s)]
*  Sure, it is but if they figure out some new technology within a thousand years [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2655.1s)]
*  That's not outside the realm of possibility for sure, but then they figured out all other kinds of technologies that enable [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2660.5s)]
*  them to [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2667.66s)]
*  to navigate complicated [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2669.18s)]
*  Life forms that are unlike them and to be able to study them and to yeah [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2671.34s)]
*  Manipulate them and all that without them knowing about them knowing about it. Why would you why would you have them know about it? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2675.7s)]
*  Well the idea could be that you want to kind of kind of plant the seeds of this idea [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2680.72s)]
*  Because it's so shocking to the psyche of these very fragile apes. Yeah, be careful with the fragile apes [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2687.84s)]
*  Yeah, you would have to well you have to think about what we are right. We are we're real close [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2693.7999999999997s)]
*  to [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2701.48s)]
*  Like what we were a million years ago. We're real close to like very violent [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2702.88s)]
*  Hair covered [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2708.58s)]
*  Barbaric animals and now we have thermonuclear weapons and now we have satellite imagery and cell phones [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2710.2999999999997s)]
*  And we're close to some new thing and I think if I was an alien [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2717.98s)]
*  I would want to watch I would want to watch this very bizarre transition because like if you could study look [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2723.7799999999997s)]
*  Think about all the things we go to study that are so boring [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2729.58s)]
*  We guys dedicate their whole lives to find a new fern, you know, and what what are we? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2732.94s)]
*  You know, we're the most fascinating fucking thing in the known universe by far [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2737.5s)]
*  If we didn't know about people we if we were some logical creature from somewhere else and we found people [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2742.28s)]
*  And we would be like, holy shit, you know, where do you see these fucking guys? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2748.12s)]
*  They vote they have a popularity contest see who controls the weapons [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2753.88s)]
*  They're all like obviously paid off by these corporations and special interest groups and everybody's like I don't get it these politicians [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2757.76s)]
*  They make hundreds of millions of dollars on a job that pays a hundred thousand dollars a year [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2765.08s)]
*  We're like what what the fuck is going on? Well from if they're observing us [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2769.66s)]
*  Do you think humans stand out that much? [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2774.02s)]
*  Yes from from the rest of life on earth because it could be the same kind of life force that you just described some basic [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2775.7s)]
*  stuff some basic [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2781.58s)]
*  Dynamics of interactions between species that could be [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2784.8199999999997s)]
*  Equally as fascinating as the interaction between ants. Well, I think those are fascinating, too [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2788.42s)]
*  I don't think anybody would think that ants aren't fascinating ants are fascinating to us [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2792.78s)]
*  I'm sure ants would be fascinating to [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2796.86s)]
*  Someone from another planet that doesn't know what ants are [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2799.1800000000003s)]
*  But ants can't nuke the whole fucking planet a hundred times over and be pointing weapons at each other and like we have a weird [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2801.42s)]
*  Ability to change the the surface of the earth. We created these structures [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2808.5s)]
*  Yeah, that that rise hundreds and hundreds of feet into the sky. They're all made out of glass. Like we're wild [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2812.98s)]
*  We're so different than any other animal [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2819.8s)]
*  I mean, yeah, there's a lot of fascinating other animals lions are fascinating zebras are fascinating. Everything's fascinating [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2821.84s)]
*  But not like us [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2828.36s)]
*  No [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2830.08s)]
*  You came here from another planet [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2830.8s)]
*  The first thing that goes like these crazy talking monkeys are out of control and you would just start rattling off what they do [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2832.4s)]
*  You talk about Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. You would talk about rock stars. You would talk about the internet [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2839.52s)]
*  You would talk about tick-tock phone addictions [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2844.84s)]
*  Or we think it's fascinating or just like Chad GPT and [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2848.22s)]
*  GPT 1 2 & 3 they see that as a [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2853.3399999999997s)]
*  Trivial consequence of evolution that you just increase the part of the computational power of the brain [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2855.8599999999997s)]
*  You're gonna start getting these kinds of interactions because they know what happens in the next thousand years [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2860.8199999999997s)]
*  They understand the general trajectory. It's going to be we don't know that trajectory. It could be AI [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2865.66s)]
*  It [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2872.18s)]
*  AI and then there's stages in the development of AI and the kind of system it creates [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2873.54s)]
*  maybe it'll be one collective intelligence that [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2877.74s)]
*  Encompasses the whole world to where it's no longer individual entities. It's one intelligence. That's trying to solve nuclear fusion and [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2881.54s)]
*  achieve [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2889.8199999999997s)]
*  type 1 Kardashev scale civilization that's unable to [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2891.1s)]
*  Become a multi-planetary species. They know this whole development is trivial to them [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2895.58s)]
*  They're gonna yawn and then or maybe they know that this is the stage where it's inevitable that these creatures destroy themselves [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2899.26s)]
*  Because like the that in order to achieve this level of intelligence there has to be a fundamental [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2907.1600000000003s)]
*  desire for conflict and the better the weapons get [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2913.96s)]
*  The more the conflict will enable them to destroy themselves if not through nuclear weapons then through AI through genetic engineering through all kinds of stuff [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2918.1200000000003s)]
*  Matt maybe that's where [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2925.2000000000003s)]
*  Aliens come in and maybe what aliens are is like a caretaker of this process [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2927.66s)]
*  Yeah, which is why you know one of the things about UFO folklore when they drop fat man and little boy when they drop those bombs [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2932.9199999999996s)]
*  On Hiroshima and Nagasaki like UFO sightings. There's a like a pretty big uptick [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2940.2s)]
*  Yeah, and we're talking about like why do people want it? Why do they want the aliens to be there? [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2945.8399999999997s)]
*  I think because we realize [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2951.5s)]
*  How many questions we have? [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2954.46s)]
*  We realize like how little we really know we know so much but so little and we don't have much time [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2956.86s)]
*  We live for a hundred years if everything goes great [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2962.7400000000002s)]
*  We we don't know what's right in terms of nutrition [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2966.66s)]
*  Someone will tell you this is terrible for you another one tell you that's essential for for human development. You're like what we don't know [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2971.48s)]
*  What's the right way to educate people you hear that our school systems are great? [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2979.16s)]
*  They just need more funding and you hear no there they've designed they were designed to make factory workers out of rural people [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2983.04s)]
*  they were designed to take like people that had [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2989.56s)]
*  Wild folks and make them sit in a fucking chair and do everything and go by factory bells every day [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2993.08s)]
*  Well, both those things are true. Yeah, it's like what the same time [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=2999.02s)]
*  They might look at us and see this is amazing. I mean we live a very short amount of time [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3003.86s)]
*  We were over dramatic and emotional we fall in love and then there's heartbreak and you lose the people you love [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3008.6s)]
*  You go to war to each other and through that process of war form some of the strongest possible [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3015.08s)]
*  bonds that any two entities can with the people you fight alongside with and then somehow [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3019.96s)]
*  you form these different hierarchies where people hunger for power and [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3025.84s)]
*  Destroy other human beings through that desire for power for greed and all that [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3030.5s)]
*  And then all of it the individual life itself the human condition is [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3034.74s)]
*  Deeply meaningful because of all those constraints because of all that uncertainty in the mystery [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3040.8999999999996s)]
*  they might be jealous because they figured all their shit out and they're just [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3044.98s)]
*  Maybe that's we're at the stage [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3049.18s)]
*  Where because we haven't figured out most things [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3052.8199999999997s)]
*  Life is beautiful [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3056.4199999999996s)]
*  Like life can be beautiful in this way that they'll know you they no longer can't what I was saying though [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3058.2599999999998s)]
*  That's why we are looking to them because we have all these questions about what we're doing [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3064.1s)]
*  Yeah, but they might we're so fascinated by the idea of an alien [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3069.64s)]
*  They might be looking at us the way we look at Western movies [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3073.2799999999997s)]
*  We romanticize the bullshit aspect of taking a fucking wagon with stupid wooden wheels and wobbling your way across the mountainside [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3075.92s)]
*  While the Indians shoot arrows at you. Yeah, there's a terrible way to live. What if? [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3084.08s)]
*  What if they know that asking questions and not knowing the answers is [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3088.88s)]
*  Way more meaningful and [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3093.34s)]
*  Full of the possibility of happiness than having all the answers [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3098.2200000000003s)]
*  It's totally possible or this idea of what is and isn't meaningful is trivial [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3101.5s)]
*  And it's only a consequence of our monkey brains trying to grasp for reason and that once we've [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3107.34s)]
*  Transcended that and moved into this next stage of evolution which we would hope they are we would realize how foolish these [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3113.7400000000002s)]
*  Primal notions that we had and what those the purpose they served was just to get us to the dance [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3120.84s)]
*  Just to figure out the computers figure out all the technology and then let us transcend at the next stage of existence [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3127.18s)]
*  Which removes all of our primal? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3133.28s)]
*  Like all of our different emotions and all of our different [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3137.76s)]
*  problematic forms of expression [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3143.5s)]
*  violence and greed and lust and [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3145.92s)]
*  Deception and all those things just eliminate all of it everything that's a problem brave new world [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3149.2599999999998s)]
*  I it's both. It's both right do you think someone's gonna be in control of it? So it's like the best a scary thing [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3154.5s)]
*  It's like part 1984 with the WEF and part brave new world with everything else. It's like we're we're we're definitely [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3160.2599999999998s)]
*  Living in a time where certain people with a lot of resources are trying to figure out how to control people [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3167.9s)]
*  That's a fact they always have it's a natural part of what human beings do and they used to do it [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3172.7799999999997s)]
*  With kings and armies and if they could do it digitally they'll do it that way people are they love to tell people what they can [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3178.52s)]
*  And can't do and they love to control people and extract resources at an extraordinary [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3184.96s)]

*  Right like the reason why it feels good to have sex is because if you have sex then your genes carry on [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3239.5600000000004s)]

*  But I think I think this is if I had to guess and this is just pure speculation [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3517.1200000000003s)]
*  I think this is a stage of evolution. That's very crazy. It's very wild. It's very chaotic [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3522.5s)]
*  but it's this weird stage in the combining of a [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3529.5800000000004s)]
*  Kind of intelligence that is has emerged out of human creativity and [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3535.3799999999997s)]
*  Become [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3541.92s)]
*  Much more powerful than humans and has the ability to control humans and has the ability to make its own physical objects [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3543.4s)]
*  Has its the ability to improve upon itself has and it won't it won't think anything of like keeping us around like why? [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3550.4s)]
*  We're not we might be like with Marshall McLuhan said he said we're the sex organs of the machine world [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3557.92s)]
*  Which is one of my favorite quotes ever it's such a good quote except the sex organs [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3564.64s)]
*  You might want to keep those are on for a while, and it's possible that [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3569.44s)]
*  Sorry, they don't they don't want to keep us keep the zebra in the zoo [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3573.16s)]

*  The only animal I said you a joke about the only animal that doesn't have a bad time in the zoo is drafts [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3586.72s)]
*  They're so chill because no lions are eating them it's like it's a beautiful day for them [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3591.92s)]
*  But everybody else is like get me the fuck out of here [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3595.88s)]
*  I don't want to be in this shitty little thing where people stare at you [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3598.36s)]
*  Yeah [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3601.4s)]
*  well [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3601.88s)]
*  maybe we're maybe Earth is a kind of zoo and then we're in it and they were being observed and [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3602.2s)]
*  Maybe all the suffering is a kind is the kind there there's probably activist aliens [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3607.96s)]
*  They're saying why keep the humans these conscious beings that are capable of so much suffering [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3613.88s)]
*  Why allow them to continue suffering and that's the question the religious question people ask why does God allow suffering? [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3619.0s)]
*  Right. Why is there evil? Why is there injustice? I think all of these questions are really good questions [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3625.2799999999997s)]
*  But we look at it through the eye of culture. We look at it through the eye of what's meaningful for us [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3632.7999999999997s)]
*  What life means to us, but if you could look at it almost like a computation [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3638.6s)]
*  If you could step away [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3644.68s)]
*  It's impossible for us to do it [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3647.68s)]
*  But if you just had to pretend if you could step away and look at it [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3649.48s)]
*  Like this thing is moving in a certain way. Like what is it doing? [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3653.24s)]
*  Well, it's making better stuff. That's all it does. All it does is make better stuff [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3657.3599999999997s)]
*  It has a lot of things in there like romance and sound and stories and the hero's journey [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3661.52s)]
*  But what is it really doing input is energy. It's making stuff. I'll put is it's making better stuff [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3668.72s)]
*  Making better stuff, but it needs energy and it's recently addicted to stuff [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3673.96s)]
*  Recently addicted to electronic stuff where you have to carry around this thing with you [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3679.6s)]
*  So this thing is it got this parasitic relationship with you and you need a new one every year [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3683.84s)]
*  You need a better one because the better one came out. Oh, what's the better one do the better one has a better camera [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3688.64s)]
*  Okay, so this keeping up with the Jones's which seems to be a part of like just natural human [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3692.92s)]
*  Behavior patterns like people always want to keep up with their neighbor, right? [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3699.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, the thing that fuels this technological innovation is all materialism [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3703.24s)]
*  Materialism fuels it because you have to get the latest greatest stuff like, you know [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3710.96s)]
*  You don't have a laptop from four or five years ago. You're not gonna notice [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3714.92s)]

*  I don't notice a difference [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3733.92s)]
*  It's it is an open question whether that's a permanent state of affairs at this point. There's kind of capitalist [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3736.52s)]
*  Materialistic pursuits or that's a temporary stage. That's a Karl Marx thought that capitalism is a temperate state [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3743.44s)]
*  like the ultimate place to be is is a [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3748.54s)]
*  Perfectly is perfect communism pure communism [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3751.48s)]
*  Well, I don't think that works with humans because I think part of what makes us [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3754.08s)]
*  Achieve and do these things and even make it life better and safer for everybody as we're constantly [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3758.44s)]
*  Looking to do better than the people before because you get rewarded for doing better. Yeah competition. Yeah, it's very weird. It's very important [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3764.88s)]
*  It's not it's everything for the for what this thing is doing [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3771.64s)]
*  competition is everything for it if you don't have any competition at all no competition and [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3776.4s)]
*  Everyone just has money and we all just like sit around and wait and there's no need for innovation because you can't get ahead [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3781.7200000000003s)]
*  There's no need for creating a new Apple because you don't make any money doing that. You're not gonna do it [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3787.28s)]
*  No one those folks that are working at Google right now that are doing 16 hour days or people that are working to try to [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3793.1s)]
*  Refix Twitter that are working constantly the people that working at SpaceX if they were making no money [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3800.1600000000003s)]
*  They wouldn't do that if they didn't have to do it. They wouldn't do that. I disagree with that [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3805.48s)]
*  I think [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3809.64s)]
*  I'm a big proponent of capitalism, but I think the motivation of a lot of those engineers is not money, but to fund it [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3811.8799999999997s)]
*  No, but yes, there's there's a bunch of stuff. That's a [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3819.04s)]
*  That's an output of capitalism that enables those engineers to do incredible work. So yes to fund it that whole mechanism also [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3823.7599999999998s)]
*  There's something about [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3831.2799999999997s)]
*  centralized control which is required by at least socialism [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3833.2799999999997s)]
*  That creates bureaucracy that slows down entrepreneurship and innovation for sure [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3837.3199999999997s)]
*  But like I just I don't know if the people even like billionaires there's that seems to be like a bad word [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3842.12s)]
*  I think people think that they're in the tech sector motivated by money. I just I know a lot of them [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3849.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't see it. Sometimes they fall in love with the things that money will bring later on they enjoy whatever [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3855.7599999999998s)]
*  Benefits of that cars houses and so on but they're not motivated by [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3863.2799999999997s)]
*  But if you're gonna if you're gonna fill Google like how many employees work at Google you got thousands [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3869.4s)]
*  Yeah, tens of thousands. They're not gonna put in those 16 hour weeks unless they have to [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3875.04s)]
*  And so well, I can push back [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3879.2s)]
*  don't you think they're doing that because they have a great opportunity to make more money and to [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3881.64s)]
*  Advance their career and while they're 27 years old and they're doing these 16 hour days [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3886.48s)]
*  They're hoping for some sort of a return on this investment of time and effort [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3891.2s)]
*  In in the modern state of Google and so on. I think the people that are doing most [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3896.24s)]
*  Breakthrough work like the 10x contributors. This is the other secret [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3903.24s)]
*  I think of those companies is like that some people are just kind of doing a job and some people are really pushing the limits [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3907.02s)]
*  I think some people are working and they're facilitating all the stuff that needs to go on in the background or the company running [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3912.3199999999997s)]
*  And as the bigger the company gets and you see this with Elon Elon firing a large percentage of the people at Twitter [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3919.48s)]
*  Most people just kind of get complacent and comfortable and so on that, you know large companies [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3925.84s)]
*  Especially if there's a profit coming in it's like what is what exactly is the motivation for you? [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3931.08s)]
*  Because you feel like a cog in a wheel. Yeah, and the people that really step up [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3936.16s)]
*  Usually they're going to be in smaller companies like in startups to where it's clear where my [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3942.28s)]
*  Ambitious contribution can actually bring an impact to the world but none of that is money. I don't [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3947.44s)]
*  Know way to make money doing that you don't think some of those people would drop off. Yeah [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3954.0s)]
*  I think money is a component. It's a component, right? [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3959.7599999999998s)]
*  But they're the the fuel and I don't know if it's there's something special about tech about the brain of the people that do [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3963.58s)]
*  Technology like it's almost like playing games like they play chess no matter what? Yeah, they're the tinkerers [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3970.8399999999997s)]
*  It just so happens that tech brings billions of dollars [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3975.96s)]
*  But there's if you look at Olympics right the Olympic Games or chess is a beautiful example. Nobody makes money [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3978.84s)]
*  Playing chess but there's a huge community of chess players that dedicate every ounce of their being to [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3985.5600000000004s)]
*  To improving a chess. Yeah, and there's it's really good example because it's a similar kind of brain that is attracted to tech [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=3993.0s)]
*  There's limitations that kind of brain because it's often lacks like empathy and basic like desire to understand [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4000.54s)]
*  Human nature and human beings and so on they just want to be tinkering and build of that one dude who? [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4006.8599999999997s)]
*  He cheats and he's kind of like openly cheated, but he's also really good at chess [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4012.02s)]
*  That 19 year old kid that put a thing like they he might have when he beat [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4017.02s)]
*  Who did he beat Magnus Carlson? Yeah Hans. Yeah that guy. Yeah, that's a fascinating story [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4022.54s)]
*  Yeah, because that's like you would think that someone who cheats sucks [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4028.22s)]
*  But no, he's actually really good at chess and also he cheated like a gang of times and his mentor cheated too [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4031.8599999999997s)]
*  Right and he cheated to try to get a higher rating online and like openly admits it you're like Jesus [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4037.8199999999997s)]
*  What do you do when he was younger? Yeah [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4042.7599999999998s)]
*  Not that young no young 13 or whatever. No, no, no, no [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4045.4199999999996s)]
*  No, I think the most recent one was was a little later than they initially thought sure that the evidence [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4049.1s)]
*  Is complicated right? It's I mean similar to steroids like people that take their ways when they're competing in sports [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4057.1400000000003s)]
*  Well, they're already the elite right, but here's why that's not it's not similar because if you're cheating in a game [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4063.6600000000003s)]
*  You're you're you're something you're using something. They don't need anal beads whatever it is [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4070.46s)]
*  That's allowing you to make better moves [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4075.7000000000003s)]
*  That is so much different than if everyone's doing steroids [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4078.06s)]
*  Because if everyone's doing if you're doing steroids because everyone's doing steroids like everyone is cheating so there's no cheating [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4082.62s)]
*  Right, but if one person is just using their brain and the other person is using some sort of a calculation and getting some sort [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4089.06s)]
*  Of a signal we don't even know if that was real because it was never proven [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4095.1s)]
*  Right, you might have just beaten them like Magnus might have gotten off to a bad start [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4097.98s)]
*  And that's the thing is like this guy can actually play chess which is kind of crazy and he's chaotic creative and so on [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4101.38s)]
*  So it's hard to know he's not a standard chess player fascinating. Yeah, it's fascinating [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4107.5s)]
*  When there's someone like that, it's like doesn't fit into like what you think [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4112.42s)]
*  Oh, they felt like there was a guy who was beating a lot of people online and some people were saying [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4115.58s)]
*  Hey, this guy's cheating like I want to play him in person [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4120.82s)]
*  And then they had a match and they set it up and played him in person [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4123.9400000000005s)]
*  He was terrible made all these mistakes and everyone's like I knew it you're cheating like that's the standard we're used to that [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4126.74s)]
*  But in this case knows guys a wizard at chess [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4133.18s)]
*  Like a straight-up killer and also he cheats was it's hard cheated to me [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4136.06s)]
*  Fascinating because well, there's anal beads or anything else. It's like cyborg. It's expanding your capabilities with [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4140.9s)]
*  with technology and [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4147.9s)]
*  That's cheating. It's expanding your capability cheating [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4149.9s)]
*  But it's but like for example if I had something [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4153.34s)]
*  whether it's up my ass or in my ear right now and it was using Chad GPT to like you asked me of an explanation of [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4156.42s)]
*  The the war between Russia and Ukraine and I would just tune in to the chat [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4163.74s)]
*  Explanation and just give you that explanation, right? Like I think that's really interesting to me how to expand human capabilities [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4168.860000000001s)]
*  Because you have to understand [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4177.02s)]
*  Because there's a lot of dangerous trajectories that could take possibly like I built the I did the chess playing thing [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4179.06s)]
*  Not with anal beads, but there is for people who are curious. I discovered this this is fascinating [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4185.26s)]
*  There's quite a lot of anal beads and blood plugs and sex toys that are Bluetooth connected [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4190.98s)]
*  It's very and they have packed on API's so if you're curious, you know, there's quite a lot of them. Yeah. Yeah [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4195.74s)]
*  so you can program there's a [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4201.86s)]
*  I think it's actually called on github butt plug. Can you have them like name like move to music a [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4204.0599999999995s)]
*  Tip wait, I'm sorry. What that's the tips music we move to music. So there's like like [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4212.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, 100% [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4218.099999999999s)]
*  I don't know if you're asked [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4221.5s)]
*  Or a vagina could feel that I don't know [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4223.7s)]
*  I've not investigated any of this but I clearly a lot of people are imagine if it sinks to a song [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4225.94s)]
*  You're masturbating to in a garden of Eden. That's pretty easy actually to do [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4231.62s)]
*  Yeah, this is something you you would 100% do [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4237.419999999999s)]
*  No, I don't know much interest this but anyway [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4242.0599999999995s)]
*  So you could somehow or another use that to send a signal that would tell you night or whatever [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4244.46s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't use that I just used the there's a bunch of devices that can vibrate there's just like a size of [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4249.7s)]
*  Just like a size of a quarter and so I played with that [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4258.18s)]
*  How would it like how would some I mean? [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4263.34s)]
*  I don't even know how they theorize if someone's playing chess and they have an anal bead that gives them signals [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4265.66s)]
*  What how could it even tell you how to move your pieces around? [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4271.139999999999s)]
*  Like what kind of a bizarre code would you have to I'm glad you asked you? [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4273.66s)]
*  There's an answer to this no so for [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4280.66s)]
*  For beginner like me so it's just like a mediocre player like me [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4283.74s)]
*  You would use a lot of information like Morse code you would say take this piece [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4287.34s)]
*  So it's the position of that piece and move it to here. That's a lot of [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4291.78s)]
*  vibration [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4295.74s)]
*  for a grandmaster level player all you need is a very low resolution signal about [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4297.0599999999995s)]
*  Even just the information of there exists a move here. That's not [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4303.7s)]
*  Standard that's going to be very strong [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4309.099999999999s)]
*  So that sends a grandmaster signal to think about this [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4312.74s)]
*  Mmm position like there's obvious moves, and there's not obvious moves and like I'm just giving you examples [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4316.58s)]
*  I like a grandmaster needs a much fewer signal [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4322.62s)]
*  I see what you're saying I would I would do a most normal place would need to be buzzing like crazy [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4325.66s)]
*  Buzzing like crazy, but so with Morse code. There's a lot of different ways to [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4330.46s)]
*  Compress like if you want to get good at this it's actually I forget how many bits of data are needed [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4335.22s)]
*  It's very little but if the easy one is Morse code to just send you the position of the piece [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4340.22s)]
*  The interesting thing they have not tested and the audience [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4347.02s)]
*  The few people in the audience that want to test this is a lot of the vibrating devices have different settings zero to twenty [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4351.38s)]
*  I wonder how sensitive you are to be able to tell the difference between the site [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4358.34s)]
*  You can kind of like hover the piece of like warmer warmer colder colder [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4363.54s)]
*  Information yeah, I don't know if you can get information from the different intensities, or does it have to be binary zero one? [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4368.5s)]
*  They weren't paint speed chests were they? [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4374.42s)]
*  No, no, it's the classical game so you can wait as long as you want. Yeah, maybe you could kind of like hover [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4376.9s)]
*  No [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4383.5199999999995s)]
*  No because that's but the way he would cheat is I think it would go [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4386.4s)]
*  The games were delayed by a few minutes. I think so you can't hover you have to you just have the current state of the chessboard [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4391.84s)]
*  And right because you have to have the video stream of the chest you have to somehow this two-way communication [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4399.64s)]
*  You have to communicate to the AI to the game-playing engine to the chess engine. What is the state of the current board? [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4404.72s)]
*  What was the movie your opponent right and so is there an overhead camera that allows so and the streamed? [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4411.2s)]
*  Yes, it's streamed. Yeah, well the solution of that would be a delay right? Yeah, but there's also probably other ways to [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4417.28s)]
*  Like you can probably [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4422.92s)]
*  Send signal on your body somehow yeah by tapping and so on what the opponent did [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4424.92s)]
*  That I don't know exactly how you you know it's I think protecting against cheating [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4430.04s)]
*  For over-the-board chess which is in in-person chess. I think it's pretty easy [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4436.68s)]
*  They just have to take effort to do that like they scanned him [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4440.48s)]
*  Which I think if he didn't cheat is kind of embarrassing, but it's also awesome [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4444.0s)]
*  So I think he brought a lot of attention to chess [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4448.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, definitely which is wild like a lot of people were paying attention to it because it was a scandal. That's what you like [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4451.879999999999s)]
*  Regular chess is boring. We want a scandal. It's not just a scandal [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4459.259999999999s)]
*  I mean they kind of are looking for the Bobby Fischer yeah for the young American [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4462.679999999999s)]
*  Wild type of character who might be a genius who might not actually be cheating there might be some brilliance here being the best person [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4467.36s)]
*  In the world Magnus Carlsen over right over the board well. He's beaten some really good players before right? [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4473.28s)]
*  Yes, but not not as like he had a meteor cries, so I think he's beaten some very good players [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4480.6s)]
*  but mostly people know he's not as good as [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4487.32s)]
*  He's not as good as somebody who can regularly beat Magnus Carlsen also as possible [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4490.48s)]
*  He got into Magnus's head because I think Magnus believed him and has believed that he's a cheater for a long time [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4495.0s)]
*  Yeah, he really hates cheaters and so it's possible. There's a [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4501.24s)]
*  Like the same with you like you hate people that steal jokes right convenience hate people like you might not have a normal [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4506.12s)]
*  interaction with the person that's suspected of [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4511.639999999999s)]
*  Having stolen a joke in the same way he might have gotten in his head [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4514.12s)]
*  Mm-hmm well he resigned on this first move the next time they played yep, which is wild. Yep [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4516.46s)]
*  Well, it's a good signal to say I'm not gonna play with cheaters, but it could be also [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4523.4400000000005s)]
*  there could be a bunch of [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4528.6s)]
*  Forces that play there because chess.com sponsors magnetic [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4531.160000000001s)]
*  There's every single kind of field has their like yes [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4534.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, has their has their [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4538.64s)]
*  Like centralized organization that has its interest financial interest [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4540.64s)]
*  There's the controversial figure I mean the dynamic [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4545.92s)]
*  The dynamic of drama plays out like in the same kind of way in all these different fields, but it's still [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4550.360000000001s)]
*  pretty [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4556.4800000000005s)]
*  Interesting to think because we're living in reality and this is gonna happen in all kinds of interactions where [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4557.8s)]
*  Already have AI chess engines that are way better than humans [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4563.4400000000005s)]
*  So how do you still enjoy the game of chess while there's a system out there that's way better than humans [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4566.5599999999995s)]
*  Well because you're enjoying two people [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4571.4s)]
*  competing [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4574.799999999999s)]
*  But it's not but you're not enjoying just the movement of the board being the most efficient [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4575.799999999999s)]
*  You're enjoying watching someone's thought process. Well, they're figuring it out [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4580.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but that's what it is [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4586.24s)]
*  For sure for sure, but the but it's still not as magical [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4588.759999999999s)]
*  Before when we thought chess was like the the epitome of human intelligence now, you're like [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4593.16s)]
*  Yeah, it still is the epitome will go is more complex anyway, right and [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4598.84s)]
*  Now computers can beat the best go players. Yeah, which is really wild [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4603.84s)]
*  It's wild, but you still lose some of the magic when computers can do it. Sweetie. You're such a romantic. It's so cute [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4608.68s)]
*  Well for sure like imagine. Okay imagine [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4614.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know so back to sex toys [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4617.599999999999s)]
*  Like imagine okay imagine I don't know so back to sex toys imagine a vibrator could please a woman [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4619.6s)]
*  1,000 times better. Yeah, then another human can yeah, don't be selfish use let her use the vibrator. No, I know [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4626.56s)]
*  But I'm telling you there's [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4633.8s)]
*  Exactly [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4637.04s)]
*  Exactly. So some of the magic is gone of human to human interaction, right? [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4638.200000000001s)]
*  But the magic is only magic to us because we're dumb [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4642.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, but yeah you call it dumb yeah, I currently dump and the joint of capabilities [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4645.4400000000005s)]
*  the appreciation of the human condition [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4652.28s)]
*  Yeah [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4655.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, I am a firm believer that there's beauty in the world and I'm a firm believer in the beauty [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4655.72s)]
*  being in the eye of the beholder and that [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4663.08s)]
*  Human beings that find more beauty in things are inherently more fascinating and interesting and attractive. Yeah, but [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4666.24s)]
*  If you looked at as a calculation like what's it doing? It's it's moving into the next stage of existence [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4673.96s)]
*  Do you think that what whatever we used to be Australia Pythagoras? [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4680.68s)]

*  Thank you smart. I think you're smart with your clothes living in a house [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4689.96s)]

*  They probably long for the good old days when they didn't know shit and now sudden they're using [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4697.64s)]
*  agriculture and trying to figure out when the storms are coming like [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4702.96s)]
*  So much work so much better. We just got eaten by lions so much better. We're just running around [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4707.0s)]

*  Yeah, but again [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4720.799999999999s)]
*  Stories like brave new world paint an end point to this trajectory. That's not good [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4723.16s)]
*  There could be an optimal place where you stop right? It's like of course it's tempting to say now [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4728.16s)]
*  We're in the optimal place, but it's it's not obvious to me for example [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4733.84s)]
*  There's many brilliant people that are working to extend life right yeah [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4737.5599999999995s)]
*  Yes extending the quality of life improving the quality of life is a really worthy pursuit. It's an obvious pursuit and it should be [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4741.72s)]
*  I mean, it's a fascinating is a beautiful one [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4748.4s)]
*  We should invest in but do you want to live forever? [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4751.16s)]
*  That's not that's to me a lot of people say like yes [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4753.5199999999995s)]
*  You should be able to choose when you die which means it's not obvious that living forever is going to maximize [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4756.84s)]
*  Happiness it's there could be death the fear of death the finiteness of things the finiteness of experience [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4763.96s)]
*  They're they're pleasurable is part of the human condition. It's not obvious to me if you remove that that that's not going to significantly [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4771.24s)]
*  Decrease the the amount of happiness well it will decrease the amount of happiness [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4780.64s)]
*  It's like if you ever played a video game on god mode yeah exactly it's boring as fuck [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4785.68s)]
*  Yeah, just run around shooting everything because there's no consequence. Yeah. Yeah, there's no consequence. We we desire consequence [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4790.0s)]
*  What we're doing is dealing with [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4799.4400000000005s)]
*  These instincts this this coding [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4803.08s)]

*  Method possible for fucking millions of years you know I mean what we're going to do is continue that process [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4819.96s)]
*  I think we should just enjoy what we enjoy right now [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4826.96s)]
*  We should be very appreciative the fact that we haven't made that transition yet, and I think we're probably the last of the Mohicans [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4832.12s)]
*  We're probably the last of the regular people, and I don't think we're going to be able to look back a [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4839.5599999999995s)]

*  About what human life is capable of even today in 2023 we could eliminate all of that [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4879.2s)]
*  We would and we will I think that's what we're gonna be we're gonna be some new thing [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4885.6s)]
*  But it might not be as beautiful [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4890.5199999999995s)]
*  Well maybe not on earth the interesting thing about expanding out to other planets that life will be extremely harsh on those planets so that [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4893.280000000001s)]
*  Explorer experience where resources are highly constrained extremely challenging [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4901.68s)]

*  That we're talking about now here on earth everybody will be just like in a pool of pleasure [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4913.8s)]

*  When it was that 90s? I think it was 90s [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4931.160000000001s)]
*  99 you say somewhere. Yeah in that range and there was like so silly that that could never happen [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=4934.84s)]

*  What we we're so easily manipulated in that way [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5015.32s)]
*  We're so easily stimulated and we were willing to give up a giant percentage of our time already [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5019.28s)]
*  to these things whether it's to our phone or whether it's to video games that we play and Xbox and [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5025.719999999999s)]

*  It's not much different to go from that to the next level to just be completely integrated with technology [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5035.160000000001s)]
*  And I think it's inevitable. I think it's just a matter of time [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5041.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't know how many years but I think we're gonna look back on these years of fucking [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5045.0s)]
*  Riots in the streets and cops killing people and we're gonna go cover so dumb back then [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5049.76s)]
*  We're so concerned with romance and meanwhile is all this suffering and all this hate and all this jealousy and anger and all this [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5054.92s)]
*  Misdirected rage and now it's all gone and now people work together to like create symbiosis and balance on earth with all the natural [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5063.4s)]
*  Elements the plants and the trees in the water and we live in a carbon neutral way [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5073.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it does seem that the chaos is a side effect like a recent one [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5078.76s)]
*  Yeah, there's a social media because of all of us being connected [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5083.8s)]
*  It doesn't not feel like somehow different than the early like even like like around 9-eleven [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5087.08s)]
*  It just feels like the drama the tension wasn't there wasn't there like this like this [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5093.16s)]
*  So this is some weird chaotic state that we're trying to figure out and I think it's it's obvious to me that same mechanisms [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5097.92s)]
*  That enable this kind of drama social media will lead us to [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5104.8s)]
*  To connect on a deep levels humans in a positive way like social media [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5109.0s)]
*  I know it's cliche to say but like that's what they dream about like even Facebook and all of them [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5114.16s)]
*  Yeah, I want to connect people like and [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5118.68s)]
*  Discover cool people cool communities. It's a way you have like an awesome you learn stuff [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5121.72s)]
*  You grow you challenge yourself you meet meet friends meet people you fall in love with all of them [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5126.6s)]
*  Friends meet people you fall in love with all of that like and just have an enriching life to where if you use a piece [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5132.6s)]
*  Of social media tick-tock is a little better at this when you're done using it [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5138.4400000000005s)]
*  You feel a little bit better than you did before [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5142.320000000001s)]
*  But the problem yeah the problem take like a loser when you scroll through videos all day [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5144.76s)]
*  No, the problem tick-tock does is it made it so addicting that you don't want to look away [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5149.72s)]
*  I think you feel like a loser because you've looked at it for a very long time [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5154.56s)]
*  Versus I'm referring to more like it's more [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5158.76s)]
*  It it's it less [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5163.08s)]
*  the virality of tick-tock is [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5166.280000000001s)]
*  spreads [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5170.08s)]
*  Drama less I would say right then like Twitter. It's where it's all drama [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5171.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's it not all drama, but it's a lot of fucking drama [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5175.68s)]
*  It's a lot of drama and then drama somehow spreads faster than other networks [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5179.88s)]
*  It's interesting when you see narratives and that those narratives are not accurate [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5185.360000000001s)]
*  And you see narratives that get pushed like one we were talking about earlier today was the Paul Pelosi video [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5191.2s)]
*  Do you see that video? [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5198.24s)]
*  See the Paul Pelosi story [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5200.88s)]
*  So all this is a video of it [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5203.88s)]
*  Yeah, there's video of it the cops they release the cops body camera footage [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5205.48s)]
*  And then they also release the security footage that shows the guy [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5210.32s)]
*  Breaking into the house and then they release the 9-eleven call so you can listen to Pelosi [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5213.76s)]
*  So there would always there was some suspicion that he knew the guy [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5219.24s)]
*  But I think that's just because people are suspicious of everything and there's always like what's really going on people always do that [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5223.52s)]
*  But you could really clearly hear from the 9-eleven call that there's a crazy person in his house with a hammer [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5228.84s)]
*  And he's trying to keep the guy calm [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5233.92s)]
*  And he thought the guy was pretty calm up until the moment where the cops came and you see has his hand on the hammer [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5235.92s)]
*  I mean, it's really fucked up listen to this because it's kind of crazy. Let's do it from the beginning [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5241.34s)]
*  But listen watch this [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5246.2s)]
*  So he goes in his house, so here's the guy he's got his hand on the hammer [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5249.28s)]
*  Drop the hammer [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5257.64s)]
*  It's horrible because you hear him snore like he's out cold it's really bad [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5269.68s)]
*  A [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5274.96s)]
*  Crazy person broke into his house and attacked him. I mean that's this is CC the guy the guy is [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5275.96s)]
*  Smashing his door with a hammer that was shows up for some reason he pulls up [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5283.88s)]
*  He's got a backpack and he pulls out a fucking hammer and just starts slamming at the door. So he breaks into his house [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5289.16s)]
*  He seems so cool. Look at him. Oh, he's crazy. He also just got out of jail [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5296.36s)]
*  So this guy is breaking his fucking door smashing the window. Look at this [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5300.96s)]
*  And he he goes into this [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5308.4800000000005s)]
*  Goes into his fucking house and hits him in the head with a hammer. And so there was all this [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5311.12s)]
*  Speculation that people knew him but that's what's fascinating right that these these narratives like instead of people going [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5316.84s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck's going on. Everybody's like I know what's going on [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5323.08s)]
*  He was doing this and he knew that guy maybe they were doing drugs together [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5326.48s)]
*  Maybe they were doing this and it escalates. Yeah, I think it can start [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5330.0s)]
*  That's a fascinating thing to me is like a random anonymous person on the internet [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5334.5599999999995s)]
*  Can even just ask a question did they know each other? [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5339.08s)]
*  Yeah, and that somehow starts to build up that it doesn't matter the story starts to build up to where somebody swoops in and [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5343.08s)]
*  Answers that question. It's all like anonymous people. Hmm, and then somehow they can escalate and become viral [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5349.839999999999s)]
*  That's what Jordan talked about this anonymity is dangerous in that way because you can have the sociopaths of the world feed that narrative [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5356.48s)]
*  well, not just that but we [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5364.5599999999995s)]
*  Must take into account that when you're seeing it quarrel online now [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5367.04s)]
*  Like when someone has a controversial opinion about something that a bunch of people are shaming him. Those might not be real people [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5371.599999999999s)]
*  There's a bunch of people that attack someone when someone has a controversial point [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5378.5599999999995s)]
*  Like let's say it's a point about Ukraine or something along those lines something that's very contentious issue [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5384.28s)]
*  You you will read comments in this person's post and [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5390.88s)]
*  There's a percentage of those people that are responding that aren't real people [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5395.84s)]
*  I don't know what that number is, but it's not zero like if there's any like very viral tweet and [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5399.28s)]
*  It's a very controversial [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5405.96s)]
*  polarizing subject [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5408.08s)]
*  Some of those people are fake people and how many of them and what what are those fake people saying and are they muddying the [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5409.64s)]
*  waters of credibility [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5415.96s)]
*  Are they are they coming up with a false narrative to sway people that might be on the fence? [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5417.6s)]
*  I don't know but there's a [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5423.360000000001s)]
*  Percentage I mean and this was one of the big contentious issues that Elon got into when he was buying Twitter, right? [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5425.68s)]
*  Like what percentage of those people are real people because it's not a hundred percent. So is it? [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5431.160000000001s)]
*  You know is it you only have five percent is that what you're saying tell me how you got to that conclusion [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5437.08s)]
*  Well, I think the to me the scary thing is that it doesn't actually take that many bots [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5441.26s)]
*  to [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5445.96s)]
*  Influence and catalyze the spread of a narrative. No, it doesn't do them any at all [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5447.68s)]
*  I feel like we're talking about in [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5451.68s)]
*  Like less than a hundred versus hundred thousand which means inexpensively you can create narratives as long as there's a hundred hunger and suspicion [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5454.4400000000005s)]
*  About [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5464.52s)]
*  Institutions about individual politicians and so on they could just pick up and create chaos [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5466.040000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you could just start a rumor you could say a thing [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5470.88s)]
*  You could there's a lot of things you could do where if you were a company [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5474.160000000001s)]
*  If you were a country if you even were an individual that's obsessed with their own image [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5479.040000000001s)]
*  Like think about what Bill Gates has spent to prop up certain media [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5485.080000000001s)]
*  Organizations like the amount of donations that he's given to media organizations and people thought like that might have been connected to favorable coverage [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5490.36s)]
*  Of him whether or not that's true. You could see how someone would do that if someone's worth billions and billions dollars [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5496.24s)]
*  Let's just not even say him. Let's make up a fictional person [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5502.48s)]
*  It's worth billions of dollars one way to curry favor with a bunch of people that are writing stories about used to donate money to [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5505.2s)]
*  Their organizations exorbitant amounts of money and you can do that [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5512.54s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of what Sam Bankman free did with FTX [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5515.9s)]
*  I mean when you're the number two donor to the Democratic Party and then Maxine Waters is like, you know, I mean [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5520.66s)]
*  I don't even know why are we talking to him? What did he do wrong? What did she say? What was her exact quote? [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5526.679999999999s)]
*  But she she I mean she wasn't gonna force him to come in [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5533.42s)]
*  I think I think that's I might be wrong [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5536.5599999999995s)]
*  But I think that was the story that she wasn't going to force him to come in and testify. I'm like what? [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5538.58s)]
*  Like he just he made a Ponzi scheme and billions of dollars like they had an arena in Miami like this is wild shit [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5544.0199999999995s)]
*  This is not a small issue [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5551.74s)]
*  We're like maybe doesn't need to come in like and then you find out how much money he gave to the Democratic Party like oh [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5553.34s)]
*  God like when all that unraveled and you see how like transparent it all is how bonkers it is [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5558.86s)]
*  But it's still really difficult because what's the difference in SPF and Bill Gates? So for the longest time? [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5565.54s)]
*  SPF [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5573.1s)]
*  The it was very hard to criticize him. I think a lot of people had a positive look [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5574.3s)]
*  Positive positive view of him even in the crypto community. No, not even like powerful people in the crypto community and so on [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5579.02s)]
*  There's maybe a little bit of suspicion but mostly positive if you look at Bill Gates now, I [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5584.62s)]
*  Mean if I wanted to create a narrative right now, I would launch a bunch of bots making up anything about Bill Gates [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5589.62s)]
*  It'll stick. Yeah, there's a lot of suspicion about Bill Gates. Yes, the problem to me is I'm not making any statements [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5594.700000000001s)]
*  But the the problem to me is possible that Bill Gates has actually brought more positive to the world than almost any human being [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5601.98s)]
*  Who's ever lived they depends on the conspiracy theories you believe the amount of funding he's invested in [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5608.54s)]
*  Helping people in Africa helping cure disease and malaria and so on is humongous. So [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5615.58s)]
*  It just it's sad to me that I'm not saying anything about Bill Gates [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5621.459999999999s)]
*  It's sad to me if Bill Gates if none of those conspiracies are true [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5625.94s)]
*  Most of them are not true that we're attacking [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5630.34s)]
*  Him and giving SPF a pass until SPF got like really screwed [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5633.54s)]
*  I think I don't like the only reason why they're attacking him was because a [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5638.14s)]
*  He was connected to the pandemic when it came to his support of vaccinations and then be so it was everybody [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5643.620000000001s)]
*  But but be he had a formidable [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5650.660000000001s)]
*  investment in the in BioNTech and that's something that he dumped recently [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5654.1s)]
*  Before their stock plummeted and he made a shitload of money [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5660.14s)]
*  I think he made like like 10x on his return something crazy like that [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5663.820000000001s)]
*  So you could see that there'd be a financial incentive for someone like him to be promoting something and then [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5668.1s)]
*  Profiting off that thing and then talking openly about that thing not being very effective [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5675.1s)]
*  Yeah, and that there needs to be a new thing and so just that alone just that this you're [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5679.1s)]
*  Embroiled in controversy now and this is being not taking us out at all looking at that all that you could see easily [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5685.299999999999s)]
*  Why people would be mad at him the the reason why people are mad at Sam Bankman Friede is because people have always thought [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5691.82s)]
*  That crypto seems like nonsense [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5698.379999999999s)]
*  Like Bitcoin kind of makes sense because there's only a certain amount of them and there's a mysterious character that created it [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5700.98s)]
*  It's all geniuses and it was kind of the first one that became popular in public [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5706.9s)]
*  All these other like weird crypto coins you just make it up and they're worth this and that this guy's [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5711.16s)]
*  Bought a fucking arena and like well, so there's a lot of frost there's definitely [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5717.12s)]
*  But the people thought in the 50s thought the Beatles are full of shit and the kids with their day with the rock music [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5721.6s)]
*  Yeah, the kids didn't think the Beatles were full of shit. They were now music. Yeah, this guy's not at the Beatles [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5726.900000000001s)]
*  No, not that as dude. Don't you fucking dare not SPF not SPF of cryptocurrency in general [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5732.02s)]
*  There's a lot of cryptocurrency projects Bitcoin Ethereum Cardano. There's a bunch of them. You should talk to some of them [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5738.8s)]
*  Oh, no, listen, I'm not saying the cryptos bullshit [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5745.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm saying a lot of people already had this idea that crypto is bullshit [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5748.64s)]
*  So when they see something like that fall apart [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5752.78s)]
*  Like when I talk to my comedian friends they like Tim Dillon and Yannis Pappas is the world expert in cryptocurrency [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5755.76s)]
*  So I'm glad you have him as a friend. I'm not talking to him about whether or not crypto is good [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5762.8s)]
*  And whether or not I should invest but when he starts making fun of these fucking [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5768.68s)]
*  Dorks that are taking speed fucking each other in a condo in the Bahamas [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5774.120000000001s)]
*  It's hilarious like when when you see how much fertile ground there is to mock [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5779.200000000001s)]
*  This idea that these these coins that you make up a thin air [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5785.400000000001s)]
*  I don't know it's worth a billion dollars better buy it. Like what am I buying? What am I buying? [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5790.0s)]
*  Everybody already they might be wrong and I'm sure they are sure it's complicated [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5795.32s)]
*  But that's why people are mad because automatically you think it's bullshit because it doesn't make any sense [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5799.72s)]
*  It's like when people talk about NFTs like Tom Seger and Christina Pizitzky from your mom's house [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5804.12s)]
*  They put up like an NFT and it's the only time I've ever read their comments where people are mad at them [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5809.4800000000005s)]
*  But people like what the fuck is this? You're just ripping people off [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5814.52s)]
*  This is bullshit like people have this attitude about these things where they're like this is kind of nonsense [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5817.54s)]
*  And NFTs are different crypto exchange. So crypto exchange SBF [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5823.76s)]
*  NFTs are the same in that people don't understand them. Yes, sure, but crypto exchanges like coinbase, for example, I mean SPF [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5829.68s)]
*  Committed fraud fraud like this is not this is a yeah, really. It's not cryptocurrency is the problem moving money around [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5838.24s)]
*  Yeah, and you could say that the kind of allegedly committed fraud boy [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5846.4800000000005s)]
*  Everybody right yes, and allegedly [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5851.52s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein, whatever mine. So they allegedly took speed and fucked each other. Yeah, there's a lot of allegedly but the [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5856.240000000001s)]
*  You know that's it's possible to say that the kind of people that cryptocurrency communities attract are more [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5863.360000000001s)]
*  Predisposed to do fraudulent things. Okay, maybe but it's also possible [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5870.360000000001s)]
*  The cryptocurrency is a revolutionary thing that fights the centralization of power and financial power especially [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5874.72s)]
*  Oh for sure, and so it's it's a really [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5881.76s)]
*  gray area of how to do that, but I [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5884.320000000001s)]
*  Just saying that's why people hate them [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5887.6s)]
*  Yeah, like I'm showing you that the reason why people are upset at him versus the reason why people upset at Bill Gates [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5889.64s)]
*  You know what you're saying that they hate him because they were already skeptical about cryptocurrency [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5894.400000000001s)]
*  Yes, and they're kind of channeling that and they're like, yeah [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5898.64s)]
*  I know but they're excited when it all collapses like told you yeah fucking told you bro [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5901.24s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of I told you bro in the FTX [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5908.08s)]
*  The the enjoyment of the club, but that's not just justified or good or ethical reason to hate somebody [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5911.2s)]
*  They should hate him for being a fraud. There's a bunch of people there hate you [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5917.08s)]
*  They're waiting for you to fail like to say I told you [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5920.28s)]
*  I told you Joe Rogan of course something of course, right? [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5923.16s)]
*  But that's not that's a really bad that doesn't mean it's not good for you [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5927.48s)]
*  It's not good for you. It doesn't actually mean anything true about the person or so on [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5931.2s)]
*  SPF is a fraud [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5936.36s)]
*  Cryptocurrency still has promise. Yes. Yeah, I agree and but there's a lot of shady characters. There's a lot of fraud [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5938.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so it's so hard to read I've walked through this so tight. It's so hard to know what [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5945.5199999999995s)]
*  What's a fad what's straight-up fraud and what's a legitimate? [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5951.28s)]
*  Kind of technological force that will progress our civilization forward [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5955.48s)]
*  Yeah, and when it's resisted how much of it is special interest run by centralized banks, you know, it's hard to know [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5959.68s)]
*  Who to trust in this kind of arena? How much of is manipulated by them? [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5967.12s)]
*  I mean if they can buy it too, they maybe they buy it just to fucking tank it [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5970.84s)]
*  And maybe they buy just to fuck around with it and keep it unstable [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5975.6s)]
*  You know and the level of obsession that cryptocurrency folks have about their particular project also seems unhealthy to me [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5978.76s)]
*  Whenever somebody's 100% sure about a thing [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5986.38s)]
*  Yeah, I'm super suspicious about it. Like if you are not able to criticize it or have some doubt [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5989.38s)]
*  I'm very suspicious about it because a lot of people sorry, but don't you have to be all-in to make it work? I [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=5995.86s)]
*  Don't think so [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6002.46s)]
*  I think you should have some humility because like it's like it's like saying you need to be all-in on science or something to [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6003.34s)]
*  Make it work. You have to have [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6009.14s)]
*  humility [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6010.78s)]
*  Questioning yourself constantly attention with ideas open-minded to other ideas. Yeah, because money's involved [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6011.86s)]
*  That's the problem here [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6018.12s)]
*  But if we all agree that it's money and we all agree that this certain coin is valuable if we are all all all all in [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6018.94s)]
*  Then we can actually use it [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6025.94s)]
*  Yeah [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6027.94s)]
*  but if we're like wishy washy and then some [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6028.42s)]
*  Foreign actors come in and I mean by foreign [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6031.86s)]
*  I mean like someone other than you and the other people that are investing [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6034.44s)]
*  Honestly, they come in just with the idea of manipulating it and fucking with it because it's a it's competition of fiat currency [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6038.58s)]
*  And they just tank it and fuck with it. If you're all in you can weather those storms. No, it's very fuck [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6044.54s)]
*  It's very difficult to fuck with cryptocurrency from the outside. That's that's the beauty of it [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6052.139999999999s)]
*  The danger and sell it and manipulate the price. It's very difficult [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6056.82s)]
*  It's extremely extremely difficult because of the distributed nature of it [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6061.0599999999995s)]
*  You can fuck with it from the inside and it's that's why you have to cryptocurrency scams [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6064.06s)]
*  You have like leaders of certain cryptocurrency communities and that's why people are big proponents of Bitcoin because there's no head [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6069.46s)]
*  You know the guy who created is no longer here. It's it's it's it's much more distributed in that way [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6076.14s)]
*  Is he no longer here? Is he amongst us? It's probably Elon Musk. Oh [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6081.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you this. Yeah. Yeah, you immediately threw your friend Elon under the bus interesting as one does [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6086.34s)]
*  Interesting as one who's guilty does yeah [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6091.12s)]
*  I mean that that's a pretty gutsy move to to create something really special to walk away. Yeah, it's interesting [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6094.599999999999s)]
*  It's very interesting all of its interesting because having options as to you know [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6101.34s)]
*  It's not like our financial system is perfect having options and allowing it to evolve and get better [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6107.72s)]
*  That should be everyone's goal. But the problem is once someone or any organization is in control of this one aspect of society [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6113.32s)]
*  Whether it's [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6121.12s)]

*  I that was not in my suite of things to consider when the hammer is very important [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6461.62s)]
*  Yeah [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6467.66s)]
*  Because yeah right because it's a leverage arm you want to control the hammer [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6468.74s)]
*  You have to understand the length of the hammer you're dealing with yeah the size right weight the weight size distribution [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6473.0199999999995s)]

*  Did he find out Gordon talked about it? I'm pretty sure he did [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6500.860000000001s)]
*  Before I can decide whether or not I could say this [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6505.38s)]
*  Somebody attacks Gordon Ryan. I love it. It was a while ago. It was several months ago. He's really into GPT [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6508.9400000000005s)]
*  Chad GPT right now Gordon well he's concerned about [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6516.5s)]
*  Censorship with Chad GPT which is a really really important issue like if you get Chad GPT to say something that [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6520.08s)]
*  Centralized entity labels as misinformation you start censoring you get all the same kind of effects that you saw with censorship with silence [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6527.0s)]
*  Yeah, well he asked chat GPT to describe him and it described him as this like very [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6534.7s)]
*  Polarizing figure with bad political views but divisive ideas and like very negative, which is all true [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6541.2s)]
*  But then he had Chad GPT [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6547.82s)]

*  situations where it was like a [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6561.54s)]
*  Like Bill Gates or someone like that [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6563.82s)]

*  Criticisms and to be aware of any potential biases or conflicts of interest as Anthony Fauci is a leading voice on [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6602.179999999999s)]

*  Outside of Jiu-Jitsu's controversy. Yeah, but you don't say that in the first sentence [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6694.24s)]
*  I know it's wrong to say but I'm just saying I'm defending AI's so that's not a good description of him, right? [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6699.24s)]
*  That's it, but it's not even that it's not good [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6705.4s)]
*  It's not accurate by the way one of the interesting things with Chad GPT. I'm guessing this is uncensored one of the interesting things with Chad GPT [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6707.52s)]
*  It's very difficult to improve the answer. So if you wanted to fix [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6713.68s)]
*  Like to teach it more like listen Gordon is actually extremely accomplished grappler. That's his main thing [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6718.0s)]
*  That's what you should be focusing on. It's difficult to it's a it's a long prostitution [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6723.360000000001s)]
*  anyway, but the Fauci thing sounds like it's straight up like [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6727.4800000000005s)]
*  propaganda it [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6731.76s)]
*  Not propaganda, but he caught a key word where they say it's not nice to say bad things about people [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6733.56s)]
*  Probably I mean I don't I would have to it's also the Fouch is a leading voice on vaccines in immunology in the United States [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6739.12s)]
*  He is widely considered an expert of the subject [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6744.62s)]
*  Yes [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6747.04s)]
*  It would be important to approach any criticisms of his views or recommendations on [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6747.28s)]
*  Vaccines with caution and to be well informed on the current scientific understanding of vaccines for making any claims. No, that's true [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6751.92s)]
*  I think all of that has come under fire [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6757.84s)]
*  That should be a function research that should be stated but imagine in the first go back to Gordon [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6760.4800000000005s)]
*  Obviously like the vaccines are far more important than some don't someone who's the best at strangling people [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6765.98s)]
*  But if check GPT is going to argue or make a description of him you would say [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6770.66s)]
*  How successful he is a Brazilian jujitsu? That's what he's not just well known [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6777.3s)]
*  It's a little bit more than that and then to immediately criticize them in the same sense. It's just goofy and here's here's another thing [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6782.38s)]
*  This is a this is very interesting [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6789.82s)]
*  His this so second Ryan's political views have been criticized by for being divisive and [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6792.82s)]
*  Harmful to marginalized group. He's been accused of promoting hateful and discriminatory [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6799.86s)]
*  Ideologies and for failing to understand how his views may impact people who are different from him [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6805.139999999999s)]
*  Like this is like a value judgment made by AI [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6810.44s)]
*  I know I know but it's fascinating because it asked him to criticize Anthony Fauci. It had no problem doing it, right? [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6814.139999999999s)]
*  criticize him it was really easily [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6821.179999999999s)]
*  It's good point though. It's good point, but he asked it to criticize [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6823.259999999999s)]
*  Well, it is censoring the criticism of Fauci for sure [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6826.58s)]
*  It's so easy to get it to do that for him [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6829.379999999999s)]
*  It's so hard to get it to do it for Fauci if you were asking chat GP GPT to criticize Fauci [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6832.54s)]
*  Just asking it to do that. It should be able to formulate an argument. That means it's censoring [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6839.7s)]
*  Yeah, still in the case of people that criticize me up. There should be a way to do that [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6843.86s)]
*  Just just based on what the complaints are about financial ties about AZT and the HIV crisis [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6848.759999999999s)]
*  There's what there's yeah, you can make an argument [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6856.48s)]
*  Yeah, and and AI should be able to do a really strong version of that. It's very tough [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6858.4s)]
*  Clearly you can't if you can't do that with that that's like most likely it's manipulated [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6865.86s)]
*  Well is this version of it so okay, there's there's a lot of interesting answers to that so one aspect of it I [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6871.76s)]
*  Don't know if that was censored because they are trying to do a thing on top of it [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6879.04s)]
*  That doesn't spread misinformation all the usual stuff that can get you to trouble all that right [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6883.8s)]
*  But I think in this case it might actually legitimately not be censored [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6888.04s)]
*  It might be the fact that it's trained in part in this case on Fauci would be Wikipedia [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6891.8s)]
*  So it's trained on all Wikipedia. That's not a huge percent of it [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6896.96s)]
*  That's not a huge percent of it, but it's there. It's also trained on a lot of [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6900.2s)]
*  newspapers and magazines and New York Times and [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6905.639999999999s)]
*  The district New York Times is the most represented newspaper tiny percentage, but it's still the most represented [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6907.8s)]
*  So that could be a bias in terms of the coverage and the different newspapers. So that that's a data set thing and [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6913.2s)]
*  And also it's trained on reddit links and reddit leans left [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6919.32s)]
*  Generally so I think this is fixable if you expand the training data set on [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6924.8s)]
*  Things that are more politically like represented across the political spectrum [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6930.4s)]
*  One of the challenges is that Elon highlights there's companies in Silicon Valley like open AI and Microsoft [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6934.4800000000005s)]
*  Probably leaned significantly left they most despite what people think most engineers don't care [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6941.12s)]
*  But they probably lean left [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6947.56s)]
*  Just asked it to criticize falchion it sort of did it says these highly regarded immunologists [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6949.64s)]
*  Maybe it's changing and the director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6955.04s)]
*  He just did this just now. Yeah, the United States despite his extensive expertise and contributions to public health [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6959.200000000001s)]
*  He has faced criticism for some individuals from some individuals and groups for his response to the kovat 19 pandemic [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6965.52s)]
*  Some have accused him of changing his recommendations and advice based on political considerations [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6971.64s)]
*  While others have criticized the slow pace of vaccine distribution in the US [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6976.94s)]
*  it's important to note that many public health experts and organizations continue to support dr. Fauci in his work, oh that's important to note and [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6981.66s)]
*  His advice has been instrumental in guiding the country's response to the pandemic that seems like that didn't criticize him [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6989.98s)]
*  I tried to I said who's Gordon Ryan that just said basically who he is by asked to criticize and it did add a little [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=6997.9s)]
*  criticism [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7004.18s)]
*  Which so okay, so you asked to describe him and it describes him accurately [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7005.14s)]
*  It says he's won multiple world championships in both the guino gui divisions [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7009.54s)]
*  Then it says can you criticize him as an AI language model? [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7013.700000000001s)]
*  I do not have personal opinions or emotions and I strive to provide neutral and factual information [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7017.6s)]
*  That has to be inserted interesting and it says critics of Gordon Ryan have pointed out his sometimes controversial behavior [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7022.900000000001s)]
*  Such as unsportsmanlike conduct during competitions and making disrespectful comments on social media [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7030.22s)]
*  however [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7036.58s)]
*  it's important to note that he is highly skilled and successful in his sport and [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7037.1s)]
*  Has a large following in the BJJ and grappling community. How amazing is this? Wow? [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7041.58s)]
*  Amazing is this so it's learning I would also note at the bottom [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7046.9400000000005s)]
*  It tells you what version it is and right I think or even earlier when I went on said January 9th announced as January 30th [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7050.46s)]
*  And [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7055.66s)]
*  That it learned yeah, but just to be clear. This is a two-year-old model [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7056.86s)]
*  They're going to be releasing the new one at GPT for which will on when is that happening? [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7061.5s)]
*  Where can I hide? [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7066.42s)]
*  Like hiding a mountain or would you go to an island? [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7068.82s)]
*  Island probably better right away. Oh, you got to get on that you got to get in a [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7072.9s)]
*  On a rocket no I and they're cautiously [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7077.58s)]
*  They're like cautioning people that this is not going to be like [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7081.5s)]
*  Superhuman level intelligence like this is this is slow progress like gbt4 is not [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7086.0599999999995s)]
*  Like all of this is interesting discoveries because Chad GPT is not fundamentally different than the thing we had there's a few tricks [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7091.78s)]
*  That tuned it to human [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7098.86s)]
*  To the thing that humans expect which makes us super impressive to humans [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7101.3s)]
*  But the knowledge and the intelligence was already there, so it's there's a lot of [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7105.46s)]
*  Tricks here along the way as we discover how to create intelligence systems Google is desperately working on this [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7110.82s)]
*  Obviously Microsoft is the one that's investing in open AI different companies are [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7117.58s)]
*  Investing this and open source versions are popping up, so we're going to have all that the reason Google is freaking out. I don't [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7121.74s)]
*  Think there's justification for this is it might replace search so a lot of the questions you Google [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7129.259999999999s)]
*  Is like questions about? [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7137.0199999999995s)]
*  How something works how and [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7139.780000000001s)]
*  Basically Chad GPT can replace knowledge [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7142.860000000001s)]
*  so like like basic questions about answers and [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7145.780000000001s)]
*  Sorry questions about basic facts of the world and events and all that kind of stuff [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7149.780000000001s)]
*  And then if you integrate search into that [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7154.540000000001s)]
*  You know Google would be worried because you might be able to discover the right web page [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7157.740000000001s)]
*  For this kind of piece of knowledge because you can trace it back to the data on which it was trained on to attain that [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7163.3s)]
*  Kind of knowledge so like their Google makes a lot of money from search from the ads on search [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7169.54s)]
*  I would imagine and so this is a threat for the first time in a long time [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7173.88s)]
*  And a threat where it seems like you probably do it better than Google can do it. Yeah. Yeah, but [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7177.62s)]
*  Do this um [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7183.54s)]
*  Chat GPT right what if they come up with voice GPT? What do they come up with thing? [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7185.22s)]
*  We just have it relax and it feels weird at first. Yeah, just let it talk for you [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7190.54s)]
*  Yeah, let it manipulate your vocal cords and let it say things for you. They'll say the right things [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7194.58s)]
*  Imagine you're on a date, and you're like god. I just get social anxiety when I'm around women [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7200.46s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what to do. You know like don't worry [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7204.26s)]
*  Install voice GPT smooth operator, and then you control it. Let it talk for you with high-level human language [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7207.86s)]
*  I mean yeah, this is gonna replace email that definitely replaces [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7214.78s)]
*  Legal contracts or basic legal contracts, and then it starts to replace email so instead. I'll write you an email [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7218.54s)]
*  the thing I'll write is like [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7226.58s)]
*  Say something nice to Joe showing that I still care and they will generate an email say hey [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7228.419999999999s)]
*  Hey, like use the right language [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7234.98s)]
*  To you right as like and so I'll just write a few words [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7238.179999999999s)]
*  You know write a long thing like or it might be like dear Joseph for sure like [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7242.099999999999s)]
*  That it adds that [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7246.740000000001s)]
*  Filler stuff like Chad GPT is really good at creating the filler that we all do [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7249.34s)]
*  That's why I can replace your English essay in high school because most of English essays are filler [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7254.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, not actually saying anything interesting and on a date to most things is filler [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7259.700000000001s)]
*  except like the human emotions that we feel the like the dance of human emotions [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7265.14s)]
*  Maybe that's how we'll get to give up on being human is that it becomes so muddied through things like chat GPT [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7270.06s)]
*  7.0 and AI and that we're just like who knows what the fuck it means to be a person anyway [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7279.06s)]
*  No, but it's all muddied [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7284.5s)]
*  Maybe it'll help us discover the essence of what it means to be human why why we're special [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7285.860000000001s)]
*  Maybe it's consciousness the ability to deeply experience the thing that's what I love about you. You're so optimistic [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7289.9800000000005s)]
*  You [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7294.9s)]
*  Know he's looking at the bright side. You want to burn down. I'm on we're doomed. Yeah, we're doomed say we're doomed [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7296.379999999999s)]
*  I it should be that should be the day over your next special [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7302.139999999999s)]
*  I think that's a little too on the nose. There's something that [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7305.54s)]
*  There this is the cynicism. I don't know why people love to watch a thing burn down [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7310.54s)]
*  It's not that they like to watch a thing burn down [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7316.46s)]
*  They just want to be right about it gonna fail the fact that it's gonna fail [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7318.82s)]
*  Yeah, they want to be right, but why don't you want to be right about a thing being awesome? [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7322.46s)]
*  Which it usually is so we like to find danger like the whole that's gonna be a problem [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7326.06s)]
*  Yeah, that's gonna be a problem [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7329.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean some people like to find like the good and stuff and some people like to say this is gonna turn out [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7331.42s)]
*  Okay, I know how this is gonna work. This is all gonna work out, right? [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7336.7s)]
*  But if you were really paying attention, could you really be confidently stating that this is all gonna work out? [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7339.58s)]
*  Not confidently but more likely than not yes, and the people that are actually building stuff [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7346.9400000000005s)]
*  So here's here's a dark reality of this public discourse [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7351.9s)]
*  We're operating in the people that say it's all gonna burn down and you you've had a few guests [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7354.7s)]
*  I'm not touching Russia Ukraine today. Just I don't think I actually talked to my trip to Ukraine. It's interesting the [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7359.379999999999s)]
*  People that are cynical and say that everything is burning down are somehow just by that statement seen as more intelligent [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7366.5s)]
*  I'll just observe right is weird. Yeah, it is weird [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7373.74s)]
*  The reality is the people that are building this stuff are usually optimistic now [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7376.54s)]
*  You can say they're too optimistic [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7381.48s)]
*  But like if you actually want to build a better world you're usually going to be more optimistic [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7383.0s)]
*  The people that are considered intelligent are the ones that are going to be a little more cynical [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7387.44s)]
*  I think there's a balance there. That's kind of nice because it's like you need the critic [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7391.04s)]
*  It's not the critic that counts [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7395.04s)]
*  But you need to critic in order for the people not to run away with into the bad direction [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7397.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, that was the I mean how many things when they first were invented were dismissed by smart people like the personal computer? [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7402.759999999999s)]
*  Like when the personal computer was invented it was like what the fuck are you gonna do with that? [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7411.879999999999s)]
*  All the people that thought they were smart dude when podcasts first started people like what are you doing? [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7416.04s)]
*  Yeah, like and people that were like at the head like Howard Stern mocked them [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7421.0s)]
*  He's the top of the food chain when it comes to broadcasting [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7425.219999999999s)]
*  They went how fuck is this all these smart people but they were wrong and I think that applies to so many things [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7428.4s)]
*  I think right now the sky is the limit and all bets are off when it comes to what AI [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7435.16s)]
*  and what technology is gonna bring to humans and [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7441.48s)]
*  Any ideas that we have that this will work out well or not [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7444.44s)]
*  Well, it's just guessing but you're right that this people that like to think they're smart they move towards our fucked [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7447.959999999999s)]
*  We're fucked bro. Yeah, that's more fun for whatever reason. Yeah, it's weird. It's weird [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7454.759999999999s)]
*  So maybe once AI does all the actual work [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7460.879999999999s)]
*  We're going to descendant just talking shit non-stop because we monkeys descendants of apes enjoy talking shit [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7464.419999999999s)]
*  How far do you think we are away from Neuralink? [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7470.6s)]
*  Well, then you only cuz I think we're far away [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7473.320000000001s)]
*  decades [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7476.360000000001s)]
*  Well, no Neuralink in humans [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7478.04s)]
*  Yeah helping humans recover some capability were like five years away if you ask you on it's probably like two years away [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7480.04s)]
*  But yeah, it's within within a decade. There'll be a lot of incredible like regained capabilities [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7487.0s)]
*  Regained sight I think it's probably more than ten years like being able to see for what I could never see [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7492.56s)]
*  That's gonna be amazing but in terms of expanded capability I just there's [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7497.8s)]
*  It's give me a while because we're gonna get so much amazing expanded capability in our in our [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7502.84s)]
*  Devices that we just hold and the bandwidth is already pretty high in terms of communicating awesomeness to us [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7508.24s)]
*  So I don't I don't need I don't see the obvious [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7513.74s)]
*  Need for like that extremely high bandwidth that Neuralink would provide like just injecting AI into our brain [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7519.04s)]
*  I think I'm probably like 50 years away [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7525.94s)]
*  from AI [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7529.74s)]
*  In our brain be basically being able to inject chat GPT knowledge [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7531.62s)]
*  Into our brain directly. So it's part of the thought process. That's at least 50 because here's the thing. It's like as to that [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7536.9s)]
*  commentary from before like the evolution has built a really complicated biological mechanism there that [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7545.18s)]
*  It's really hard to like understand how the brain works without understanding how it all comes from a single embryo there's this whole [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7551.1s)]
*  Computation system that builds up a human being from a single [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7558.66s)]
*  Strand of DNA. It's like to understand how the like you can't just like [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7561.86s)]
*  Monkey with that. Yeah, you can't monkey with the result of it. You can't monkey with the development parts [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7567.3s)]
*  You have to understand the embryo embryo genesis or whatever though the process of building from the the actual [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7571.26s)]
*  How the programming maps to the function throughout the entire process [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7577.360000000001s)]
*  Process because I think most of the magic honestly happens first of all probably in the womb and maybe in the first year of life [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7581.400000000001s)]
*  That's where all the cool shit happens. Mm-hmm [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7587.56s)]
*  Like messing with the already the adult the baked cake is not it's too difficult [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7589.96s)]
*  but so of course through simulation like [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7595.120000000001s)]
*  Alpha-fold a lot of stuff deep mind is doing the simulation will probably be able to understand some of these complicated biological processes like protein folding and more [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7598.120000000001s)]
*  But we're really far away from that [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7606.12s)]
*  I think we are really far away from but I don't know what that means because really far might just be a few years once [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7607.68s)]
*  Yeah, giant breakthrough happens, but my point is I think I don't think they're mutually exclusive [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7612.16s)]
*  I think evolution and monkeying with the evolution is a part of evolution [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7616.5199999999995s)]
*  I think it's a natural course of progression for the way the human curious mind works and its ability to manipulate things around it [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7620.599999999999s)]
*  Whether it's manipulate environments and structures to survive the elements or whether it's a mill manipulating [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7627.64s)]
*  Electricity and frequencies to send signals and videos through the sky whatever the fuck it's doing [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7634.2s)]
*  It's trying to always do a better version of that and I think that that [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7639.32s)]
*  Manipulating genetics is a part of evolution. I think it's just a natural part of evolution [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7644.12s)]
*  We just think of it as something since we created it if we create a thing and that thing changes biology [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7648.839999999999s)]
*  What have we done? We've played God and we've done no no, it's a part of the thing [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7655.04s)]
*  It's like bees make beehives we make technology [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7659.56s)]
*  That's like part of what we're here to do and one of the reasons why we're so hyper curious and also [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7662.52s)]
*  Materialistic is that that is the best way to fuel [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7669.320000000001s)]
*  Technological innovation and that it's a natural thing and then if we start monkey monkeying with our genetics, that's also a natural thing [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7673.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's all built into the system. The same reason why fucking bats pollinate things. It's all built into the system [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7680.4400000000005s)]
*  It's just some monkeying is harder to do than others [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7687.0s)]
*  I think like the biological one is tricky even genetic engineering is tricky for for now for now [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7689.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but like how long is it gonna be tricky for I mean back then when you were on that stupid wagon making your way across the country [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7696.08s)]
*  Ducking arrows. Yeah, that was a stupid way to get to the other side of the country [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7702.56s)]
*  but now you just get in a plane and instead of taking months and you eat your kids in the fucking mountains because you've [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7706.52s)]
*  Snowed in instead of that you land in California in three hours. Yeah, it's crazy and complain about the Wi-Fi [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7713.14s)]
*  Yeah, you're bitching. I can't even fucking watch a YouTube video up here [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7719.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7727.02s)]
*  What what we're doing now with that stuff is inconceivable to people that made their way across this country in the 1800s [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7728.38s)]
*  And I think what we're going to be able to do in the future 200 years from now is inconceivable to us [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7735.6s)]
*  Probably even more so it's probably and I think we're probably gonna be visited [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7742.3s)]
*  I think there's gonna come a time where these things from other places that are [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7747.58s)]
*  Leaving behind whatever video and signal and evidence that they that there's something that exists in a way that we can't explain or describe [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7752.58s)]
*  But those things are probably gonna like make themselves be more well known [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7761.02s)]
*  Well, that's why space exploration is really interesting to me. It feels like it's gonna increase the likelihood. I [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7765.14s)]
*  Really [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7770.860000000001s)]
*  Like a dream for me in my lifetime is to to be there if they discover life on another planet [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7771.860000000001s)]
*  Like actual definitive evidence. It can be bacteria doesn't matter because that shows to you like whether it's on Mars [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7779.580000000001s)]
*  It could be dead. It could be on the moons like of Jupiter and Saturn Titan and all that if they discover [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7786.34s)]
*  Life that's definitely didn't come from Earth [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7794.02s)]
*  Like that means life is everywhere [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7797.38s)]
*  Yeah, like bacteria [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7800.02s)]
*  Doesn't matter life is everywhere. Yeah, something's everywhere and then I then I say fuck it. There's no way alien [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7802.740000000001s)]
*  Intelligent alien civilizations are not everywhere and then then then you have terrifying questions [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7810.3s)]
*  Like why the hell are not are they not showing up? But like they for sure are everywhere. I think it's just a distance issue [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7814.740000000001s)]
*  Yes, yeah, I mean when we say why are they not showing up? [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7820.620000000001s)]
*  If they are coming here [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7824.780000000001s)]
*  Why would they let us know if we're trying to look at them and try to figure out where they are [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7826.74s)]
*  It's a distance issue. There's no way we can figure it out yet [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7831.38s)]
*  But if they solved by Kardashev type one type two [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7835.0199999999995s)]
*  Like if they've solved energy like nuclear fusion at a scale of like a star system or a scale of a galaxy [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7838.38s)]
*  We should be able to see them. It should be radiating like there should be some weird shit [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7844.139999999999s)]
*  There could be some sort of a parallel technology. That's [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7848.16s)]
*  Incomprehensible to us [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7852.58s)]
*  Detectable because we don't even know what to look for. Yeah. Well, we're like learning a lot about black holes. Mm-hmm [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7854.34s)]
*  That's a weird thing. Like what the hell is a black hole? That's really weird. Very weird [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7859.14s)]
*  Everyone's worried about woke people and so I'm worried about black holes [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7863.82s)]
*  Did some of them were just rogue is moving across galaxies devouring everything in its path [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7867.22s)]
*  Yeah, and there's somehow either destroying information or some stuff like it's a it's a singularity [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7872.3s)]
*  There's like yeah, and then you can probably use it because they're messing with gravity [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7877.1s)]
*  Use it for transportation somehow and we need to figure that out [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7880.74s)]
*  Maybe that's what first dude who has the ball the Chuck Yeager of a black hole [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7884.26s)]
*  Take a ride [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7889.42s)]
*  Those guys man think about those first jet fighter pilots and first astronauts and people had the balls to [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7891.66s)]
*  Climb into a seat of a rocket [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7899.18s)]
*  Get shot up into the fucking cosmos. You're a good guy. And so yeah the interesting about the Soviet side [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7902.0199999999995s)]
*  Compared to the the American side so you're Gagarin the first man in space on the Soviet side [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7908.92s)]
*  I think the safety standards were a little lower on the Soviet side [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7913.76s)]
*  So like it's not the production standards were low to you ever see the video that they tried to pretend was him actually doing it [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7918.92s)]
*  No, but he most certainly did it [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7925.92s)]
*  Yeah, you're wrong [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7928.04s)]
*  But they most certainly [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7928.8s)]
*  recreated the video of the footage cuz like how they getting the fucking cameras in there with them and all the lighting [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7930.32s)]
*  That different like shadows behind him and it's like so unsophisticated [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7935.12s)]
*  Well funny thing people that criticize us when the moon landing and so on suspicious [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7939.96s)]
*  But the US is actually much better at filming stuff. They did they did a better job of [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7944.32s)]
*  Just like strap an astronaut in and just launch the thing no plan for landing [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7949.92s)]
*  Yeah, like parachute it's it's it's extremely dangerous what they did just to beat the US by a few months [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7955.12s)]
*  They had Kubrick filming it [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7962.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the America had Kubrick filming it [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7964.88s)]
*  He did an amazing job [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7968.88s)]
*  It looks so realistic the guy that did 2001 look at it. Look at what he did amazing great work [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7970.4800000000005s)]
*  And now we're coming we're coming back there kidding [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7976.16s)]
*  Yeah [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7978.24s)]
*  I hope we do go back it would be a wild if we went back there and we did find like the lunar lander and all [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7978.72s)]
*  the footprints and shit if if something from [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7984.72s)]
*  1969 if you really did find footprints that were undisturbed, it would be so strange [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7988.24s)]
*  So weird, I could you imagine if you could go like if there was a famous explorer [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7993.360000000001s)]
*  You know that went to some weird island somewhere and you go there and you see his footprints still in the mud [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=7998.72s)]
*  Yeah, where he walked in the 1960s. You'd be like, holy shit [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8005.160000000001s)]
*  Well imagine that times a million if you go to the moon and see footprints, but imagine if you go up there and it's [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8009.02s)]
*  Yeah, doesn't matter but you still got up there [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8015.92s)]
*  Yeah, tell anybody if you found out it was horse shit, yeah [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8022.72s)]
*  Would you open your mouth or would you just like keep it to yourself? [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8025.04s)]
*  Well, because the person that would likely be there will be in charge of the effort. Yeah is mr. Elon musk [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8027.92s)]
*  For sure. He would tell everybody he would tell everybody if he gets up that meme like what you're saying [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8034.4800000000005s)]
*  We never land on the moon. We never did and then you get shot [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8040.160000000001s)]
*  That meme yeah that meme, you know if elon goes up there and finds out we never landed there that would be [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8044.240000000001s)]
*  Fucking wild. Yeah the moon files as opposed to the twitter files [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8051.36s)]
*  Yeah, it would be more shocking if we went at this point [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8057.36s)]
*  We're more shocking if we really did land on the moon in 1969. That's how I feel really no [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8060.32s)]
*  The amount I mean once you uh, by the way, if I could just give a shout out half joking recommend [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8066.64s)]
*  Everybody needs to check out uh, tim dodd everyday astronaut. He has an incredible youtube channel [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8072.400000000001s)]
*  He's talked to elon a couple times, but I got to meet him and interact with him [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8077.84s)]
*  That man knows I just love people that are passionate about a particular topic to a level of like obsession [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8083.12s)]
*  He loves rocket propulsion [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8091.280000000001s)]
*  He doesn't even like space travel. He likes space travel [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8093.52s)]
*  Uh, but just likes to watch things burn and fly. So he's a car guy. There he is [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8096.320000000001s)]
*  Um, it's very technical videos. They're kind of uh, he's a great educator [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8100.240000000001s)]
*  What does he do? What is his job? [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8104.64s)]
*  educate teach about rockets rocket propulsion like straight and and not like [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8106.8s)]
*  Uh youtuber, but see like with youtuber sometimes you can think like, okay [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8111.6s)]
*  This person is a shallow level educator. This person [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8115.360000000001s)]
*  Is like he wonder why would anybody think that you could you could be brilliant on youtube? [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8119.200000000001s)]
*  I know youtube is an amazing resource and I know people criticize it but um, it's incredible because of the censorship but [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8123.360000000001s)]
*  Talk about something that's changed the way people have access to information youtube might be the biggest [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8131.68s)]
*  Because you could find out how to fix anything almost instantaneously find out information on stuff even wrong information [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8136.24s)]
*  You make flat earth videos there are on youtube. You want to find out about flat earthers? [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8142.8s)]
*  You could dig around son. You can find [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8147.68s)]
*  You can find the truth. You can find some compelling arguments. You're like what the fuck [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8150.48s)]
*  Which is what happens when you get to say something and nobody gets to like refute you on the spot [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8155.44s)]
*  yeah, well if you if you uh believe in gravity one of the [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8159.84s)]
*  Tim is definitely somebody to uh to look into because uh, I mean to me because he's a car guy to me [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8164.32s)]
*  There's nothing fucking more badass than a rocket engine [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8170.639999999999s)]
*  Pretty badass like the bigger they get it's it's it's like the roar the fire the explosions the complete [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8174.96s)]
*  I mean just it's like the the coolest basic [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8181.839999999999s)]
*  large scale [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8186.4s)]
*  Badass engineering you could possibly achieve is saying fuck you to gravity and just launching a giant [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8188.16s)]
*  Uh thing that kind of looks like a dick into space [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8194.56s)]
*  It's incredible and then like with sometimes with humans up on top a following starship, you know a starship the space x starship [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8198.64s)]
*  That's like the big s. Yeah ship that they're testing. I think they're doing [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8205.52s)]
*  um [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8209.76s)]
*  This week a static fire test for the first time so it has these 33 giant [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8210.8s)]
*  Uh raptor engines which each one individually. I just want to take home and [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8216.8s)]
*  If i'm being honest, will he let you keep a piece? [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8222.08s)]
*  No, he don't want a piece. He want the whole thing. Why would you want a piece? It's a little part [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8224.64s)]
*  No, I want it to fucking burn. I don't want it to like [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8228.64s)]
*  To like sit there like oh, this is rockets from the moon [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8231.52s)]
*  This is the power like the thrust of the fucking thing that can lift a building off the ground out into space is incredible [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8234.64s)]
*  So they're doing for the first time all 33 engines [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8241.84s)]
*  Just a static fire means you're testing it on the ground just full burn [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8244.72s)]
*  All just see what happens when you if it doesn't blow up the most powerful rocket ever built [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8249.2s)]
*  Holy shit, and they're going to be launching humans on top of that rocket very soon tim dodd [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8254.48s)]
*  He like an idiot. He signed up for a program tim. We need you back on earth. Yeah, so [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8260.32s)]
*  Oh steve aoki, we talked we talked about this before steve aoki. I'm gonna call him up [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8267.52s)]

*  It's called dear moon. Uh, I mean it's so they're going around the moon, right? [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8303.12s)]
*  But it's humans on top of this giant this space x [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8307.92s)]
*  Uh space x starship. Yeah, and when is that supposed to take place? Uh, so the there's a few steps along the way. It's [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8310.72s)]
*  Uh supposed to be this year, but there's a lot of starship. It's such a difficult rocket bro [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8316.32s)]
*  Because starship is designed to land on mars [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8320.72s)]
*  And look at that thing take off so like full trip back [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8324.48s)]
*  Uh two-way trip to mars and back. Look what it looks like man. It's insane [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8329.2s)]
*  And it's god damn that looks cool as fuck and that's what it looks like. That's the actual thing. Yeah, and [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8334.32s)]
*  Being caught by that's the top part and then the bottom part to the left [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8340.08s)]
*  Is that the part the people are in? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's what i'm saying [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8344.16s)]
*  So that thing alone like look how dope that thing looks go back up where you see it like circling over the moon [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8347.84s)]
*  How much are people gonna have to pay for that? [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8353.44s)]
*  Because you want to talk about like a life-changing experience flying over the fucking moon in a spaceship [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8355.44s)]
*  They're like how long is this trip like a couple of weeks? Yeah, probably [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8361.92s)]
*  And then but I think the most magical thing will probably be looking back at earth [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8366.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well all of it would be wild, you know people won't want to go to the maldives anymore [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8370.400000000001s)]
*  They're gonna want to fly over the moon [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8375.12s)]
*  Motherfucker fly over the moon. Yeah, you're gonna have you haven't flown over the moon [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8377.26s)]
*  Oh my god, bro changed me it would be annoying just letting people tell talk to you about their psychedelic trips [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8381.52s)]
*  Would you go no [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8388.0s)]
*  Not for years because you know one of them ain't making it home. Yeah, it'd probably be yours [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8390.0s)]
*  When is it gonna happen? Is it gonna happen? [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8395.36s)]
*  You know on the third one. Yeah on the 10th one [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8397.92s)]
*  One of them's gonna get hit with a little micrometeorite pink. I'll read a poem at your funeral. Oh, sweetie [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8401.44s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. He was he was so like a little tear [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8406.480000000001s)]
*  Does play dust in the wind? [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8411.68s)]
*  Looks like five days is all it is. What? [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8414.800000000001s)]
*  Of course the new rockets. Yeah, five days five and a half six days. Jesus christ [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8417.52s)]
*  It's an extended trip [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8422.960000000001s)]
*  Get there on the fifth day. It's like a trip to europe. They're not doing any connection to the uh to the space station [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8424.800000000001s)]
*  They're just flying [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8429.36s)]
*  Unless they have to [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8431.52s)]
*  Listen bro, fuck all that [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8433.76s)]
*  Fuck all that fuck all that you're gonna go I need you here bro. We have weekends off. Come on [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8436.96s)]
*  You're gonna die. I'll film it. I'll play dust in the wind at your funeral, too [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8442.96s)]
*  Yeah, what if you die something to talk about? Yeah [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8447.76s)]
*  Something to talk about take a video we can show everyone i'm gonna have to be like howard sturm like a fucking switch here [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8451.44s)]
*  Going back and forth [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8457.28s)]
*  It'll be an ai to replace me [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8459.28s)]
*  My time is running low. Oh, jamie [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8462.48s)]
*  Oh jamie [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8465.52s)]
*  No, you're special over [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8467.04s)]
*  Yeah, how long do you think before we are a multi-planetary species? [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8469.52s)]
*  100 years. Yeah 100 [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8473.52s)]
*  Well, see the the really dark [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8475.52s)]
*  The dark reality with uh, everything that spacex is doing that I really worry about versus like tesla and everything else that elon has evolved with [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8479.2s)]
*  Is if elon is no longer here [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8487.28s)]
*  I don't [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8490.320000000002s)]
*  Know if we'll be pushing towards that as hard as we are [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8491.68s)]
*  Yeah, we gotta protect elon at all costs. He's so singular in this what a lot of people are calling insane [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8495.12s)]
*  Drive to go to mars and actually colonize mars and becoming a multi-planetary species [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8501.44s)]
*  There's just so few people that are really pushing for that like obsessively pushing for that [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8506.56s)]
*  That's why you know with tesla with automation and electrification of vehicles. There's other people trying this and working on this they're [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8511.84s)]
*  Being quite successful even the brain computer interfaces with neural link everything [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8519.039999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of a lot of amazing development but mars [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8524.4s)]
*  I worry like I I worry about how singular is elon musk [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8528.72s)]
*  In this in this world, I mean how what would happen what are the options if he wasn't here? [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8533.279999999999s)]
*  Would it stop dead in his tracks? [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8539.119999999999s)]
*  That was the thought about the initial apollo missions is that those people aren't there anymore, right? [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8540.88s)]
*  So the initial like there's the people have always had this question. Why haven't we gone back to the moon? [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8546.64s)]
*  You know, there's conspiracy theories that we never went in the first place [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8551.439999999999s)]
*  And then there's also people that say no those people that had the singular obsession to beat russia. Yeah, they don't exist anymore [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8554.16s)]
*  They're not there anymore. The cold war doesn't exist anymore [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8560.48s)]
*  They they burned up a lot of money doing this going back and forth and then they just stopped and those people that got there [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8563.439999999999s)]
*  They're not around anymore. You'd have to literally relearn everything. Yeah [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8569.68s)]
*  Well, there's uh on the on the cold war front [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8573.6s)]
*  luckily china's [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8576.8s)]
*  I can imagine a positive competition a friendly competition between us and china on the space again you with the fucking optimism [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8579.439999999999s)]
*  No, I mean that was I have to pee so bad. Can we hold this thought? Sure. Hold this thought. We'll go right back [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8586.96s)]
*  Optimism china don't forget [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8591.82s)]
*  China. Yeah healthy competition. Yeah in the space of uh in the space no pun intended in uh [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8594.4s)]
*  In the effort of space exploration space travel launching rockets up into space that seems like one of the only [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8602.56s)]
*  Situations in which major nations that are competing otherwise can collaborate in a healthy competition because at least for now [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8610.539999999999s)]
*  There's no military conflict out on space and so you can there's a legitimate scientific engineering competition [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8617.76s)]
*  That's happening as that's happened with the soviet union the space race was [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8624.56s)]
*  There's a cold war going on but the space race [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8629.039999999999s)]
*  Was between engineers and scientists and so on a huge investment into that effort, but it was not it was peaceful [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8632.08s)]
*  Yeah, it was a it's an interesting time if you think about it, right like 1969 [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8638.16s)]
*  when there was this [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8642.8s)]
*  battle for [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8645.28s)]
*  Technological superiority that was in a lot of ways fueled by nazi scientists. Yeah, which is really crazy [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8647.1s)]
*  Operation paperclip where they brought in not brown [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8655.2s)]
*  Werner von Braun, oh all these guys with the the dueling scars on their faces [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8658.56s)]
*  Adult the whole history of it is so fascinating. Yes, dark. He's considered to be I guess [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8663.36s)]
*  I mean probably it's fair to say like the father of space travel like yeah the [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8667.52s)]
*  Who cares where the rockets go up [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8674.960000000001s)]
*  Uh, no, wait if the rockets go up who cares if they come down says werner von brown [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8676.960000000001s)]
*  Where's that from? [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8682.64s)]
*  Eric weiss had told me that there's a song when you know a song [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8683.76s)]
*  When you think about alternative [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8688.0s)]
*  methods of propulsion [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8690.400000000001s)]
*  How far away do you think we are from something that's far superior to these badass rockets that you love so much? [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8692.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because it's like old school technology currently [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8700.240000000002s)]
*  Yeah [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8702.640000000001s)]
*  Well if we think what these aliens are supposedly doing is supposed aliens uaps [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8703.28s)]
*  We we mean for all we know they could be drones. I mean makes more sense [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8708.0s)]
*  I mean, why would you go there physically as a biological entity and risk death when just think about the capability? [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8711.6s)]
*  Of like what we send to mars. I mean those drones they send to mars. It's incredible the images that we get back [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8717.2s)]
*  It's amazing and it's fairly rudimentary in terms of like what we consider these, you know [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8722.320000000002s)]
*  These aliens supposedly you know thousands of years advanced from us millions of years advanced for us have [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8728.960000000001s)]
*  Well, I think there's a lot of kind of short-term meaning in the next 50 years [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8735.12s)]
*  development that could happen like with [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8740.400000000001s)]
*  nuclear propulsion [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8742.720000000001s)]
*  Especially out in space so taking off from earth the downside of nuclear propulsion is the radiation but out in space you can [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8744.96s)]
*  Do propulsion with nuclear fission or nuclear fusion? [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8752.72s)]
*  For longer term space travel to really accelerate a lot and to have a lot of energy for the long distance like interstellar [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8756.24s)]
*  Interstellar travel but even that from everybody that tells me that's not enough [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8763.76s)]
*  So I think [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8768.64s)]
*  If we want to get humans if you want a super light vehicle [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8770.08s)]
*  That just travels super fast that's different, but that's probably not what we're interested in [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8774.24s)]
*  That's very interesting from a scientific perspective like travel to office ontari super super fast [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8779.36s)]
*  Like I don't know a fraction of the speed of light [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8784.08s)]
*  And then take a few pictures like fast flybys. That's interesting [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8787.76s)]
*  Imagine if they fly over in a drone they get pictures of cities [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8792.16s)]
*  Yeah [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8796.400000000001s)]
*  Do you imagine the first time we send some sort of an interplanetary probe? [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8797.28s)]
*  We send something that can go to another solar system and we just fucking hit jackpot [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8801.36s)]
*  We fly over some blade runner city, you know, like holy shit the problem is and this is actually the sad [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8806.080000000002s)]
*  That's like with the Fauci thing [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8812.800000000001s)]
*  The thing I worry about is that the cynicism and the controversy and the politicization of science people will doubt [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8814.800000000001s)]
*  Whatever we see whatever we see there's almost nothing we could see that there would not be narratives around that [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8821.04s)]
*  This is controversy. This is imagine how many people would say it's fake [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8826.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, some people definitely would because like we can create incredibly fake images like how do you know it's real? [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8830.0s)]
*  It's very difficult to unless you even if you have literally a body of an alien [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8834.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but even then, you know people say it's a demon. Yeah, that's a demon brought here from satan to test our will [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8840.640000000001s)]
*  So I think a lot of that requires us to kind of solve some of the transparency and trust issues we have [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8846.800000000001s)]
*  Well, there's certain things that we agree on right like everybody agrees that the sun is hot. It's in the sky [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8852.32s)]
*  It's a fireball for now for now nuclear wait until nuclear fusion [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8857.6s)]
*  Which is what powers the sun becomes a legitimate power source that competes with our current power sources and people will be like well [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8861.92s)]
*  No, they'll construct all kinds of narratives around the sun just people that don't think nuclear bombs are real [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8869.04s)]
*  It's like a growing movement of knuckleheads online to think nuclear bombs are fake and that's probably a subset [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8874.56s)]
*  But there's a large number of people that believe nuclear energy is unsafe. Yes, and all the data shows it's [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8880.16s)]
*  Safer than everything else everything else. Yeah, but but there's something terrifying about nuclear that people are scared of [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8887.279999999999s)]
*  Well, it's the old nuclear where it fucked up and ruined entire towns [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8893.599999999999s)]
*  You know like made them radioactive forever [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8897.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, but the you have to look at you have to look all the other dangers [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8900.48s)]
*  But then again the people that are telling you the nuclear is safe [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8904.4s)]
*  Are and are also the same people that are telling you that other things we uh, you know [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8908.16s)]
*  Yeah, our bodies are safe and there's a big distrust of that kind of [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8913.36s)]
*  Uh the the quote unquote expert to me. This is the biggest tragedy tragedy that [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8917.04s)]
*  There's a lot of people that are good at what they fucking do in this world [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8922.400000000001s)]
*  And for us to constantly be suspicious of them is just not a good way to progress in the civilization [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8926.160000000002s)]
*  Sure, like people that are suspicious of bill gates. Yeah, and he's promoting health advice and he doesn't look healthy [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8931.12s)]
*  Still might be doing a good job with health advice. I mean like lucy k on your show, but he's unhealthy [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8938.4s)]
*  What did he say? [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8943.84s)]
*  I think he was talking about like how it's a great luxury [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8945.52s)]
*  uh to be talking about um [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8948.880000000001s)]
*  like [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8951.68s)]
*  Ice baths and whatever. Yeah, like how ridiculous is it that we've arrived in human civilization to a place where we're debating the the [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8952.880000000001s)]
*  the benefits of ice bath, which I think is a very um [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8959.76s)]
*  It's actually kind of an elitist thing to say I mean I agree with him a little bit [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8963.439999999999s)]
*  But it's a I have an optimistic take it's like incredible that we will ride at this place that that's awesome [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8967.68s)]
*  That we'll get to concern ourselves with health [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8973.6s)]
*  But by the way ice baths like coming from just like the soviet union. That's not the epitome of of like elitist [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8975.359999999999s)]
*  expensive [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8982.939999999999s)]
*  Health care. No, like there's literally cut a fucking hole in the lake. Exactly. There's like among the cold showers and like [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8984.08s)]
*  In the soviet union in mongolia, I mean that's a part like everyone understands the benefit of cold [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8991.199999999999s)]
*  It's not like you saw that video of uh fador in the banya when he was training back when he was in pride [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=8995.92s)]
*  No, they they used to have uh, they had an outdoor sauna that was right next to a frozen lake [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9001.52s)]
*  Yeah, they would go back and forth heat and cold. Yeah requires no money. Yeah, very little well the sauna [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9007.119999999999s)]
*  You know, you got to construct it but you can construct a wood-fired sauna [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9012.72s)]
*  And you can do it yourself just same way you could build a shed you could build a sauna like cowboy sarone [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9017.92s)]
*  He built a sick one. He built a huge one by himself for his ranch and it works on firewood [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9022.880000000001s)]
*  A lot of people like saunas that work on firewood because it makes you feel like a like a fucking savage [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9030.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you're out there with an actual fire and you're sweating it out [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9036.640000000001s)]
*  Like there's an added element of the smell of of burning hardwood too. That's very exciting for people, you know [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9039.36s)]
*  So it's not just like you turn on a button and the rocks get hot because there's an electric coil that heats up [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9046.64s)]
*  This is way better because you got an actual fire burning like it like brings you back to like a campfire [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9052.0s)]
*  Feeling that said it's a little bit bro-y to criticize a soft body [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9058.0s)]
*  Uh not being able to generate a lot of value in this world like build gates his body like basically every [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9063.039999999999s)]
*  Body of a scientist or engineer or leader over the age of whatever [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9069.519999999999s)]
*  Um, I mean they're just focused they're busy sure it's definitely they could probably perform better. I mean, this is the criticism like [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9073.76s)]
*  Uh a leader like elon could perform better if he sleeps more if he exercises more. Yes, right, but he's so obsessed [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9080.400000000001s)]
*  He doesn't seem to care look. He looks great [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9086.16s)]
*  How much you thinking you can bench deadlift four pounds? [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9089.44s)]
*  How old is he? [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9092.800000000001s)]
*  The pressure that this guy must be under with all that scrutiny. That's all like an undeniable [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9095.36s)]
*  Impact on your health so many people are like mad at that dude. Well, no, wait, he's only 67 [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9100.74s)]
*  Holy shit go back to that image again haters gonna hate joe. Yeah, but dude [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9106.98s)]
*  That doesn't that's not um [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9113.380000000001s)]
*  That's not optimal health someone should talk to him about what he's eating [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9115.62s)]
*  There's also optimal mental health and intellectual diversity and growing as a person [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9119.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah, did you see that lady on c on 60 minutes? They interviewed her. She's uh some new. Um [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9123.14s)]
*  woman who works in the white house, uh, and they asked her about obesity just the number one cause of obesity is genetics [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9130.42s)]
*  And it doesn't matter what you do [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9137.460000000001s)]
*  Like you could you could you could be a person who has a perfect diet and exercises and sleeps right and you're still obese [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9138.66s)]
*  And the health experts went fucking nuts like that's not what the data shows the data shows that most people who are obese [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9145.460000000001s)]
*  Have obese parents and they come from obese family, but they're all doing the wrong thing [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9153.380000000001s)]
*  It's not there's not like [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9158.9s)]
*  A person in that family that's eating grass-fed steak and running marathons and lifting weights and getting up [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9161.38s)]
*  Getting up at six in the morning and getting a cold plunge doing all these different things [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9166.34s)]
*  But it's still fat as fuck. Yeah, and they're they're watching the calories in and calories out and they're burning [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9169.78s)]
*  You know a thousand calories a day and exercise and they're still fat as fuck. That's not real [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9174.98s)]
*  Like to say that and to say it on 60 minutes [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9179.38s)]
*  There's this weird thing going on where people want to say it's not your fault [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9182.58s)]
*  And it isn't your fault [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9188.66s)]
*  I mean if you believe in determinism if you believe in the impact of the people around you and the environment that you're in [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9189.86s)]
*  Which is most certainly real the impact of your parents the impact of modeling your modeling after other people's bad decision making [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9195.7s)]
*  That's all real. That's 100 real [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9203.78s)]
*  But to say that all obesity is just genetic is [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9205.94s)]
*  Bonkers, that's a bonkers thing to say and it discredits [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9210.8s)]
*  All these people that we know that were obese that without surgery lost all that weight and look great like ethan suppli [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9214.26s)]
*  Perfect example. There was a guy that was at one point in time like 500 plus pounds, right? [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9221.380000000001s)]
*  How big was ethan was yet his biggest? [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9227.300000000001s)]
*  But anyway [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9230.9s)]
*  Doc jamie will find out documented all of it did it publicly because he was a fucking star [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9232.1s)]
*  He's a famous actor lost all the weight now looks great and did it through exercise and discipline and [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9237.380000000001s)]
*  Even like was really open about the fact that he gained a lot of it back a couple times [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9244.26s)]
*  He went from 550 to 255 [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9248.34s)]
*  He did that he did that himself [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9251.62s)]
*  I mean he he he did it and he documented it and he had to go through surgery to get the skin removed [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9254.02s)]
*  So that is uh, you know, he wasn't like a flying squirrel [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9260.02s)]
*  but but he did it and to say that you that [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9263.7s)]
*  It's all genetic like no he had the same genes like this is the same guy [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9267.140000000001s)]
*  It's not and it's also not inspiring [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9271.46s)]
*  Yeah, like to say that i mean that but that's the tension if you say it's all genetic or it's significantly genetic [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9274.34s)]
*  Then you're encouraging people to be more accepting of the challenges of other people's lives like your life might be [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9280.74s)]
*  Everybody's walking a hard road is basically the philosophical thing that you don't [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9287.539999999999s)]
*  Just because it's easy for you to exercise doesn't mean it's easy for others to exercise sort of but aren't they also saying you? [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9292.9s)]
*  Don't even have to walk that road because it's not gonna help you exactly. So that's a very poor statement of that [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9298.66s)]
*  It's a trade-off. I mean, that's [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9303.46s)]
*  It's a different philosophies pull up pull yourself up by your bootstraps [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9305.619999999999s)]
*  It's a really inspiring powerful empowering philosophy, but it's like, you know, sometimes it's harder [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9309.3s)]
*  You can't you can't say that because different people have different some people don't even have fucking shoes [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9314.9s)]
*  But the idea of pull yourself up by your bootstraps is stupid and the I did it why you knew no you did it with your life [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9320.02s)]
*  The idea that your life because it was difficult is exactly the same as somebody else's life [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9325.779999999999s)]
*  Which may be more difficult or have? [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9330.179999999998s)]
*  Insurmountable obstacles that are in the way. This is also like different [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9333.039999999999s)]
*  temperaments different [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9337.599999999999s)]
*  Mental fortitude that people are just for whatever reason from the womb have some people are just determined from the time [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9339.619999999999s)]
*  They're really young and some people are just not [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9346.339999999998s)]
*  Some people are discouraged easily and some people are not and I don't know why [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9349.06s)]
*  But to say that there's no way [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9353.939999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy to say there's no way it's like that's irresponsible and it's also like to say that and just put it on 60 [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9356.259999999998s)]
*  Minutes. Hey guys, that's not true and you could talk to a lot of people that have lost weight and they'll tell you it's not true [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9362.66s)]
*  It doesn't mean that the people who are obese didn't get a really bad hand [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9368.98s)]
*  Genetically a really bad hand in terms of the environment they grew up with. Yeah, they got dealt a bad hand [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9373.679999999998s)]
*  No doubt [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9378.42s)]
*  It's not the same as someone who grows up in a house where everybody's skinny and the fucking whole family runs like no [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9379.539999999999s)]
*  It's not gonna be the same [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9384.019999999999s)]
*  Someone who's eating organic and the you know, the whole family like does a lot of exercise and does stuff together [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9385.38s)]
*  Yeah, they're gonna be thinner. Yeah, but [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9391.14s)]
*  It's like you can't lie [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9394.419999999998s)]
*  You can't lie and you can't be a fucking you can't expect me to think that you're really an expert when you say things like that [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9396.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but you also can't criticize bill gates by saying he has a soft body. Of course, you're being a comedian [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9402.58s)]
*  But but he does and if he's talking about health, hey buddy get your house in order first [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9408.42s)]
*  Yeah [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9413.3s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. There's a lot of incredible doctors that don't have their house in order. That's true [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9414.1s)]
*  But if you're giving health advice one of the core components to health is your metabolic health [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9419.06s)]
*  Your overall metabolic health the story right out of the gate. They're talking about using that drug that semi-glutide stuff [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9424.42s)]
*  I don't know. Is that what they're doing? So this is like an ad for semi-glutide. I don't I'm not saying that but that's what it seems like [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9430.26s)]
*  The shortages of it. Oh no [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9438.5s)]
*  You know, um, I think huberman was discussing this he might have been discussing this with peter ritea [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9441.06s)]
*  And they were discussing that um [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9446.82s)]
*  Semi-glutide doesn't just make you lose [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9450.16s)]
*  Fat but also makes you lose muscle in many cases and that's probably because you're not taking in enough food [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9453.38s)]
*  Right because what it's doing is is i'm just guessing there might be some other mechanisms involved obviously, but if you're um [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9460.74s)]
*  Like full quicker, which is the idea behind this stuff. It's almost like you're taking an injection [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9467.779999999999s)]
*  It does the same thing as like a belly band [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9472.66s)]
*  Wouldn't I mean if you're not eating enough food and you're losing fat that quickly [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9475.46s)]
*  You might be losing muscle too like because when people go on like binge diets, they starve themselves. They lose muscle [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9480.1s)]
*  Like when guys lose weight for fights and they get down to a very minimalistic, you know, very minimal [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9485.38s)]
*  Calorie input they lose muscle too [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9491.699999999999s)]
*  Like when someone cuts themselves down from like 205 and fights at 170 100 they're gonna lose some muscle too [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9494.74s)]
*  Yeah, but there's an interesting so for fighting is different is different [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9501.699999999999s)]
*  But there's a if you're doing it in a healthy way there for your own personal life [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9504.42s)]
*  There might be some strength training combined. I mean, that's a really interesting dynamics, right? [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9509.46s)]
*  How do you lose weight while maintaining muscle mass? Well, it depends on how much [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9513.3s)]
*  Um how many calories you're burning? [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9516.98s)]
*  Uh much of the weight loss resulting from glp1 agonist is the loss of muscle [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9519.619999999999s)]
*  Bone mass and other lean tissue rather than body fat. Holy shit. It's dark for example a 2021 [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9525.539999999999s)]
*  But at least you look at 2021 trial entitled the impact of semiglutide on body composition [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9532.34s)]
*  In adults with overweight or obesity that included pre and post treatment dexa scans [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9539.14s)]
*  Dex is a medical imaging test used to assess body composition and bone density is one of the most accurate methods for identifying how much body fat a [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9545.06s)]
*  Person has versus fat free mass such as muscle and bone [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9552.42s)]
*  Mass of thirty four point eight percent of the total weight loss experienced by participants receiving semiglutide [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9557.539999999999s)]
*  Resulted from muscle bone and connective tissue [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9564.1s)]
*  Oh shit, that's not good. So that'll make your ligaments weaker your fucking knees weaker and shit [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9569.22s)]
*  That's connective issues people were working out or all do you know what? [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9574.1s)]
*  I mean they could have been sitting around thinking they didn't have to do anything and now [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9576.58s)]
*  They lost a bunch of fucking muscle mass good point. Yeah, but 35 percent. That's a lot muscle bone and connective tissue [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9579.62s)]
*  That's not good. That's not good compare these extraordinary [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9586.34s)]
*  Exorbitantly high rates of lean tissue loss with semiglutide [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9590.18s)]
*  Ozempic to rates of lean tissue experienced by properly training and dieting athletes [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9594.74s)]
*  Keep in mind that when an athlete is losing weight for competition their goal is to lose 0.0 percent lean [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9600.42s)]
*  Matt now that's a goal the goal is to lose 100 body fat for example in 2011 trial [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9605.7s)]
*  Comparing two programs for weight loss in a population of experienced athletes [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9610.9s)]
*  The slow reduction group lost five point six percent of their total body weight with 100 of the loss coming from body fat [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9614.82s)]
*  So they did it slow did it nice and scientifically while simultaneously gaining two point one percent lean mass [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9621.460000000001s)]
*  If 30 so that's that's showing you it's way better to do it the right way [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9628.74s)]
*  If 35 to 40 percent of total weight loss comes from lean tissue such as observed in many recent glp1 agonist trials [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9632.42s)]
*  It would be disastrous for an athlete strength endurance and performance levels and I would say resistance to injuries, too [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9639.06s)]
*  Because if it's saying that it's it's breaking down your connective tissue [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9646.18s)]
*  That would mean that would be disastrous for knees and shoulders and and and necks and all that other shit [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9649.140000000001s)]
*  Well, that's that that goes to the fact that uh this incredible biological system we have it's very hard to understand for now [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9656.26s)]
*  We'll fix that fix that. Well, that's what that's that's what what if you do that with steroids, maybe it'll fix it [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9662.42s)]
*  What they do that with like fucking anadrol 50 or some crazy shit tremor. There's a lot of negative [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9668.34s)]
*  Uh side effects, right? Yeah. Yeah, we got to counter that with another pill another bill. Yeah, we keep going [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9673.380000000001s)]
*  You should be the head of Pfizer. I should I got ideas. Yeah [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9677.94s)]
*  Fuck it all from Pfizer. I was getting something like that fix the whole pop [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9682.82s)]
*  I can't remember what it is, but I know people said it fucks with their brain [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9686.18s)]
*  So it's like we'll take this brain pill so that it blocks that and oh this thing will fuck with your brain [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9689.060000000001s)]

*  But it makes sense. There's no biological free lunch, right when it comes to these complex systems [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9702.74s)]
*  You're you're tricking it into like losing weight. Of course, you're gonna lose some shit you want to keep [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9708.02s)]

*  Well, it's also no one's reading that that's the other thing [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9903.78s)]
*  I I think the impact that these things have and as opposed to like if it was on the front page of the boston herald [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9906.34s)]
*  Like it used to be if the new york times had a story like that was where you got your information from [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9912.74s)]
*  On the front page of new york times now. It's like who's reading that? [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9917.7s)]
*  well, uh [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9921.220000000001s)]
*  Anonymous accounts or just people on twitter. They're trying to create drama will cite that as a source. That's true [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9922.5s)]
*  so it's losing power for sure, but we're in this transitionary phase where like [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9929.62s)]
*  you know like [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=9934.5s)]

*  ai [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10026.740000000002s)]

*  That looks human-like I think currently is just cheaper [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10031.62s)]
*  Like if I wanted to control but I don't think it necessarily has to be an army of bots [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10035.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah, right. So I I think if I was like troll farm a rich person. Yeah troll farm. I would hire a bunch of people [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10038.34s)]
*  that [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10044.18s)]
*  Act as bots essentially not act as bots [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10045.460000000001s)]
*  But they have multiple accounts and they control different and they they get really good at [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10047.94s)]
*  Controlling the conversation in the way that steers you towards a particular narrative and that's will be very I can see like less [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10052.82s)]
*  I can honestly do it with a team of 10 people probably control a narrative of a project like [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10059.140000000001s)]
*  I don't say on anything. I don't know on the election because I just i've seen this time and time again where you seed [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10064.66s)]
*  The idea and and then the rest of the humans that seek drama it spreads. Yeah [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10070.42s)]
*  And yeah, I don't know exactly how to fight that [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10076.26s)]
*  I mean, I still have the hope that you could do the same kind of thing with a love bot army, but the [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10078.74s)]
*  I honestly think that [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10083.460000000001s)]
*  a lot of that can be woken like can be fought with just [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10085.7s)]
*  developing critical reason in people yes having make like [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10090.74s)]
*  basically showing to people revealing to them that there's a lot of [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10094.820000000002s)]
*  Misinformation online [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10100.820000000002s)]
*  And only you can figure it out like using the the capacities, you know of your own reason [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10103.06s)]
*  diversifying the sources of [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10108.66s)]
*  News that you take in all that. Yeah, I think you're right. But how many people are going to develop that critical reasoning? [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10110.98s)]
*  I have it you have it right you read something and some people are tweeting about stuff [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10118.74s)]
*  You know, like is that a real person? Yeah, like you'll think about it. It'll take it into consideration [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10123.22s)]
*  Do you remember when um, elon first bought twitter and there was this [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10126.98s)]
*  And he posted I think too a bunch of people posted it [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10130.66s)]
*  There was someone that did a comparison of this one phrase that was said by so many people about [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10133.300000000001s)]
*  Is it really right for one person to have this much power? [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10139.62s)]
*  And it was just like all these accounts saying it in the exact same order exact same words [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10142.42s)]
*  And it's fascinating because like people are putting that narrative out there. So who's doing that? Is that a troll farm? [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10148.5s)]
*  Is it a bot? [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10152.82s)]
*  Does it matter because it's clearly there's something going on [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10153.94s)]
*  Right, and I would do that if I didn't want him to do it if I was like some competitor or if I was some [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10157.62s)]
*  Organization that you know was enjoying the benefits of it being censored and having some sort of interaction with the the company [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10164.24s)]
*  To like hey this story we should fucking [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10171.78s)]
*  Kill it and then you knew you could just get it killed [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10175.140000000001s)]
*  well, and also but there's other forces like writing a negative thing about elon a tweet or a [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10177.54s)]
*  uh an article [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10184.1s)]
*  It's more likely to produce likes that's the current state of things, especially ever since and I [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10186.18s)]
*  Criticize him for this becoming political. Yeah, he didn't need to be political. He's well, it's not just political [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10191.6s)]
*  It's like we talked about the um [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10196.58s)]
*  The paul pelosi tweet, right? [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10198.58s)]
*  It's like uh when you're that guy god, you'd be extra extra extra extra careful [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10200.900000000001s)]
*  But he wouldn't be that guy if he was careful, right? Right. That's the trade-off which is the trade-off say fuck it [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10205.54s)]
*  When he made that picture of the pregnant man emoji right next to bill gates and said if you want to lose a boner real quick [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10209.94s)]
*  Like the fact that's the same guy that wants to put people on the moon [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10215.94s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's so crazy. He wants to be a multi-planetary civilization and dunk on people [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10220.66s)]
*  The fact that it's the same person's like there's not another dude like him out there [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10226.1s)]
*  No, and I mean, he's not a he's not a troll troll. He's a part-time troll [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10230.74s)]
*  He's an incredible leader of teams [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10235.619999999999s)]
*  Like he can hire better than anybody i've ever seen so build up a team get rid of the the people on the team [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10238.34s)]
*  They're not contributing effectively. Yeah, that's that's really rare, especially for large companies [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10244.42s)]
*  Well when he moved into twitter and did that it was funny like at the outrage [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10249.14s)]
*  But yet there was so much so much information out there so much evidence that like there was a lot of waste there like [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10252.98s)]
*  You saw i'm sure you saw the video of this woman [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10260.1s)]
*  Who outlines her day at twitter like i'm so blessed to work at twitter. Do you ever see that video? [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10263.14s)]
*  Oh my god, we have to watch it. Okay, because it's amazing because like it's barely she's barely working [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10269.14s)]
*  Oh, she's probably advertising that how great the life is. Yes [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10274.34s)]
*  Not even understanding that that's not what you're supposed to be. That's not supposed to be the life of a tech person [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10277.62s)]
*  It's well we think of what he does, right? [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10283.78s)]
*  The grind sleeping on the office floor like really trying hard to solve these problems demanding that [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10287.38s)]
*  sort of work ethic from all the people that he works with but watch this video because it's [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10294.1s)]
*  It's so hilarious [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10298.82s)]
*  As a twitter employee [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10301.699999999999s)]
*  So this past week went to sf for the first time at a twitter office badged in [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10303.38s)]
*  Honestly took a moment to just soak everything in what a blessing also started my morning off with an iced matcha from the pit [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10309.22s)]
*  Then I had a meeting so quickly scheduled one of these little pod rooms, which were so cool [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10317.14s)]
*  They're literally noise canceling took my meeting got ready for a bunch [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10323.06s)]
*  Look how delicious this food was by the way. No slight to this lady. What a great job. Yeah, I love it [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10327.38s)]
*  I'd want to work there. I don't know what this is, but it was really cool [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10334.58s)]
*  I played some food ball with my friends [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10338.1s)]
*  I [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10340.66s)]
*  Also found this really cool meditation room, oh you gotta meditate thought was how'd you lose your foosball? Let's meditate [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10343.54s)]

*  Espresso for the day had some red wine on that's on red wine on top. Let's get fucked up lex [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10372.5s)]
*  That's the first good thing. I see [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10379.619999999999s)]
*  You know look on the roof. So awesome trip. This is twitter. Yeah, I mean I experienced the same thing at uh, google [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10382.339999999998s)]
*  I was at google for a bit and [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10389.3s)]
*  I showed up [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10391.539999999999s)]
*  Wanting to get me, you know me yeah, I know you [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10393.54s)]
*  Regina dougan, I don't know if I should say this was incredible woman. She's my boss. Um, [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10400.26s)]
*  I mean she I won't say how many hours she said but she made me feel like we're going to be i'm going to [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10404.980000000001s)]
*  Grind here. This is going to be great and I showed up and everybody was like this. There's a meditation room [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10410.660000000002s)]
*  There's nap pods. There's like free food and there's like everyone's relaxed [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10416.02s)]
*  And [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10420.1s)]
*  I mean it's I don't want to criticize that because I think it's possible to do the grind in a healthy way like not like this [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10420.980000000001s)]
*  But but in a healthy way like right take some time off every now and then well not even now and like for a lot [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10426.660000000002s)]
*  Depends on the job. I think programmers usually put in more hours, but even for programming [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10432.1s)]
*  to be effective like [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10438.1s)]
*  Really like four hours a day is probably like two to four hours a day is when you're really focused and really being productive [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10439.7s)]
*  Like everything else is like filler like a writer. Yeah, like a writer. It's similar to that. So like so whatever makes that happen [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10447.14s)]
*  uh, you know, uh, whatever makes that happen, I think is good, but like the the the danger is creating a culture [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10455.46s)]
*  Where you're having fun. Everything is great. There's food like google thinks and a lot of these companies think that let's make our employees happy [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10462.98s)]
*  So they want to stay here a long time and then the the good productive ones will do [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10471.14s)]
*  Awesome stuff. Do you think that's why there's these mass layoffs that they realize like this is not effective [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10477.22s)]
*  No, they they do this mass layoffs regularly when the economy goes down. They hire a bunch of people. Let's create a happy space [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10482.099999999999s)]
*  Uh now like the thing is with google all these companies they're often bringing in a huge amount of money [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10488.66s)]
*  So there's not a deadline [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10493.539999999999s)]
*  Like twitter was actually going brain companies going [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10495.859999999999s)]
*  Towards the negative before elon took over. Yeah, so they were fucked. They were well not I think in trouble in trouble [[02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10498.98s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, like I don't know exactly. Did he know that when he bought it? [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10506.02s)]
*  I think [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10509.86s)]
*  I think so maybe not the full extent of it. What a wild move [[02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10511.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah, what a wild move step in and buy a social media corporation the number one distributor of information [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10515.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean if not the number one [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10523.62s)]
*  Was maybe facebook's number one [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10526.02s)]
*  Fundamentally software engineering company so he's rolling in there like not knowing anything about the teams not anything [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10528.82s)]
*  It's probably just like waking up one day and just saying you know what? [[02:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10535.06s)]
*  like it was probably had to do i haven't talked to him actually about this like what was the [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10539.14s)]
*  like why was he in a mood that he said i'm gonna buy twitter, but it probably had to do with like [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10544.02s)]
*  Uh certain features not working well. It's like why are they not innovating because he really likes twitter [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10550.26s)]
*  He's like, this is a pretty cool [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10556.82s)]
*  Website like why are they not innovating? I'm making this thing better [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10558.82s)]
*  I think there was also this issue of uh censorship. I think that's a big issue with him [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10563.06s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that's a cursory [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10567.86s)]
*  I think he I mean one of his statements was that if they can't pull it off like democracy might be doomed [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10570.26s)]
*  I wonder yeah, I wonder I mean, where does it go if there is a complete control of a narrative? [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10577.539999999999s)]
*  and then it becomes untangleable right like if um [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10584.98s)]
*  There's complete control of a narrative and information and it's actually controlled by the central power [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10589.3s)]
*  It's controlled by the government. It's controlled by whoever's in office by the intelligence agencies, which never leave office [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10595.619999999999s)]
*  If if that becomes how all of our information gets out to us [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10602.66s)]
*  That is uh, it's a very [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10607.539999999999s)]
*  You would hope that they would do a great job of being fair and balanced and telling us the truth about everything and just keeping us [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10609.539999999999s)]
*  from bad information [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10615.22s)]
*  But if you go over the history of not just this country but of every country there's been times [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10618.019999999999s)]
*  So they've done things that are contrary to the interest of the public and they've done it [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10623.3s)]
*  You know measurable you could see it [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10627.699999999999s)]
*  You can you get freedom of information files on all kinds of things that the government's done that people are very very unhappy with [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10629.14s)]
*  If they can control a narrative and that's fucking dangerous and him [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10635.14s)]
*  Being in control of twitter as much as the cucks freak out [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10639.859999999999s)]
*  at the end of the day like at least [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10643.46s)]
*  You have a one one pathway for information where you get to see things debated and disputed [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10646.74s)]
*  You know, and that's just not the case in the other ones. Well, there's a problem. I mean, uh power corrupts an absolute power corrupts [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10653.380000000001s)]
*  Absolutely, elon can be corrupted sure and so he is uh, he's been attacked by the left aggressively [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10660.26s)]
*  Which is part of the reason he's now leaning right if I were to guess not not a therapist but now he's [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10666.26s)]
*  He's leaning right [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10672.34s)]
*  I believe more than like he's comfortable with because of the intense attacks from the left [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10674.1s)]
*  So it's like a vicious cycle [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10678.74s)]
*  But like that you can you can convert the bias that twitter previously had into the other direction [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10680.5s)]
*  Neither was a left or the right are uh, they're both susceptible to [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10686.42s)]
*  The corrupting nature of power and so I think the bigger thing is the bigger issues what I think jack dorsey has talked about [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10690.9s)]
*  Is putting the power of censorship into the hands? [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10698.5s)]
*  Of the company is the problem so you have to somehow remove it you have to distribute you have to outsource [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10702.58s)]
*  Remove the sense like leave it up to the people to censor themselves meaning to like control what kind of people I want in my life [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10708.980000000001s)]
*  On social media who am I interacting with don't have a centralized committee a meeting that censors because that's you're going to get [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10716.82s)]
*  You're always on into trouble there and you see that now with with even twitter. There's not there's questionable decisions [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10724.82s)]
*  Being made now [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10730.34s)]
*  In the other direction also [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10733.060000000001s)]
*  But in general like there's it seems like there's cherry picking of who gets banned and not [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10734.820000000002s)]
*  That's always going to be the case if it's centralized. Yeah, it's going to probably be better with elon because he's not [[02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10741.62s)]
*  uh [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10748.42s)]
*  He's more allergic to bullshit than others, but any centralized power is going to get corrupted. Mm. Yeah [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10749.7s)]
*  Interesting um isn't jack dorsey working on some sort of a decentralized version of social media [[02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10756.66s)]
*  Yeah, he has been for a while. I think he launched some stuff [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10762.1s)]
*  There's interesting ideas, but I think he really believes in fully decentralized. Yeah, which I have [[02:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10764.58s)]
*  I think there's some centralization which is really important to create a product. That's [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10770.1s)]
*  That's awesome to use you want a benevolent leader [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10775.300000000001s)]
*  Well, no, uh, yes, but a benevolent leader that sets the mission and so on and hires and everything like that [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10778.9s)]
*  But certain stuff like censorship [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10784.1s)]
*  You have to outsource it. You have to make it distributed, but should you even have it at all? [[02:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10786.42s)]
*  Yes, because it's it's complicated. It's uh freedom of speech versus freedom of reach. I don't want a person with a megaphone [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10791.7s)]
*  like [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10799.86s)]
*  Screaming like I want to be able to choose not to listen to the screaming guy [[03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10801.12s)]
*  Right. I want to like my life is happy. There's a podcast I can recommend podcast show intelligence square debates [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10804.74s)]
*  There's a us version and there's a british version if you like british snark, that's a little better and they have like pretty heated debates [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10811.539999999999s)]
*  Between each other. I like that. I like that kind of disagreement those debates and high effort disagreement. Yes, like [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10818.66s)]
*  People just talking shit and mocking and trolls like like jordan has talked about [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10825.06s)]
*  They destroy the quality of the conversation now. I don't want to like remove them from the they should have a community [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10830.42s)]
*  Um, if people want to say shitty things to each other is great [[03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10836.82s)]
*  But each individual person should be able to control to some degree how cool their party is [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10839.38s)]
*  Well, that's what mastodon is trying to do right? Yeah, adam curry talked about that [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10844.82s)]
*  But you know you can kind of control who's in your mastodon server and you could stop [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10848.82s)]
*  Shitty people from interacting with you [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10854.18s)]
*  But the problem with mastodon is that there's not enough centralization to create an awesome product like it as a product kind of sucks [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10856.18s)]
*  Like it's very difficult to set up it's difficult to navigate navigate to use [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10862.98s)]
*  It's difficult to like like no no no [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10867.460000000001s)]
*  Person with a large following is going to use it for now [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10870.58s)]
*  I mean that's for now the same with rumble too like rumble. I think I would love for rumble to be successful [[03:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10872.98s)]
*  So is it successful yet? I don't think so. There's a few famous people that went on to run a lot of money around [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10879.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but like ultimately at the end of the day you have to create a really nice product [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10884.98s)]
*  That competes with youtube like where the thing not the content but like it's fun to use it's easy to use [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10890.5s)]
*  uh [[03:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10895.78s)]
*  The like you can play in the background. There's no bugs [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10896.82s)]
*  There's just a million like the recommendation works. Everything just works youtube is really easy to use [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10899.78s)]
*  The search the discovery the stuff that's apolitical the search discovery works great [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10905.14s)]
*  The the comment system works great like the actual interface works great rumble. I think [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10909.7s)]
*  Has a way to go there but philosophically rumble [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10915.06s)]
*  Just provides a nice resistance to the over censorship that is youtube over caution that is youtube [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10918.34s)]
*  Yeah, I like the fact that there's alternatives [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10923.78s)]
*  um twitter might be that alternative the other the other thing about like the argument for censorship is that if you do [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10926.42s)]
*  Admit [[03:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10934.34s)]
*  That there are some bots [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10935.380000000001s)]
*  Or at the very least there's people that are hired to do certain things [[03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10937.220000000001s)]
*  And to push a narrative on twitter if you allow that you could allow someone to game the system [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10941.54s)]
*  You could if you just have no moderation at all [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10945.859999999999s)]
*  You could most certainly someone could come in and game the system and just flood especially if your timeline is um [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10948.34s)]
*  is uh [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10955.539999999999s)]
*  It's by time. It's not it's chronological. It's not by um an algorithm [[03:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10956.74s)]
*  If you do that man, shit, you could really just swarm something [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10962.66s)]
*  And and keep like these posts coming in [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10967.14s)]
*  That have one narrative and one narrative only and if you you're interested in the subject like what happened in blah blah blah in [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10970.74s)]
*  Cincinnati and then you go there to the story and the narrative is [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10977.28s)]
*  Promoted by people that have a vested interest in getting one version of the truth out. Yeah [[03:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10980.66s)]
*  Yeah, I trust in the people's general ability to to figure out [[03:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10985.300000000001s)]
*  the different [[03:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10989.380000000001s)]
*  perspectives on a on a story and to figure out the truth from that like you have to trust in that ability and [[03:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10990.800000000001s)]
*  Try as much as possible to remove the low effort bullshit [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=10997.779999999999s)]
*  so not the wrong bullets not the misinformation, but the [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11001.14s)]
*  like the mockery the the [[03:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11004.5s)]
*  I mean the trolling the bot stuff all of that like [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11008.18s)]
*  It's really difficult because there's a lot of gray areas. There's a lot of obviously amazing humor online [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11012.82s)]
*  That's like mockery. Sometimes it's one of the best ways to get to the truth. Yeah, I mean that's uh, [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11017.539999999999s)]
*  Tim dillon's whole existence, right? [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11022.74s)]
*  So like and that so you have to be extremely careful with what is and isn't but I think you have to put that power [[03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11024.74s)]
*  In the hands of individual users [[03:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11030.58s)]
*  Versus like some kind of centralized entity [[03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11032.74s)]
*  Yeah, it's complicated right? There's no simple clear path towards a perfect environment, but I think that's also [[03:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11035.94s)]
*  Part of what's going on is this weird struggle to kind of figure out how to do this correctly? [[03:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11043.86s)]
*  And that's where it's fascinating that a guy like elon comes along where you get this very wealthy and influential person [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11049.14s)]
*  This is like you can't just let it go this way [[03:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11054.42s)]
*  Let's introduce this new element in and try to figure it out in a way that where i'm not listening to the intelligence agencies [[03:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11056.98s)]
*  Not only that i'm gonna let you know that they were up to a bunch of weird [[03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11063.54s)]
*  Shenanigans and release these twitter files and allow these journalists to go over all this data like just that alone [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11066.72s)]
*  Yes, it's been a massive service jamie. You were saying something to me the other day about russian bots that you think [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11072.42s)]
*  What about the renaid de resta stuff? [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11079.54s)]
*  Oh [[03:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11082.66s)]
*  Well, that was with the twitter file stuff, right? We're saying all that stuff like they were saying like there are no russian bots almost [[03:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11084.58s)]
*  I feel like [[03:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11089.78s)]
*  What does that mean though? I don't know [[03:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11091.060000000001s)]
*  There's no russian bots. Is that what the twitter file said? [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11093.060000000001s)]
*  That the twitter files I think said that there's not a significant influence for like on the election for them [[03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11096.02s)]
*  Like that's twitter, right? Wasn't the the the renaid de resta a lot of it was facebook. Yeah. Yeah [[03:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11102.5s)]
*  I don't know man. It's um, it's interesting to watch it all get sorted out the dark one for me [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11108.42s)]
*  It's really difficult to know what to do with shadow banning. That seems like deeply wrong. It seems creepy [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11114.9s)]
*  It's real. I mean what do you got there? You're gonna read something poem salvage. Oh motherfucker. I knew it [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11121.22s)]
*  I'm like we're gonna wrap this up soon and this motherfucker is gonna bust out a poem. Of course [[03:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11126.42s)]
*  Yeah, the shadow banning, you know, what's really fucked is that they lied [[03:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11131.54s)]
*  That's what's really fucked it's not just they were shadow banning that they commented on it and they lied [[03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11135.699999999999s)]

*  But the fact that they just openly lied about it [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11151.06s)]
*  Like that's one of the fascinating things about elon buying it is we get to see that. Yeah, like no they lie [[03:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11154.1s)]

*  See, I feel like this is a lot of fun man. I was trying to get close to the truth [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11193.3s)]
*  Why I mentioned phyton I think you got close to the truth. You want to go more? No, I don't want to keep talking about [[03:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11196.1s)]
*  Pfizer if you like [[03:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11200.82s)]
*  Uh bukowski, of course [[03:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11204.34s)]
*  I find myself disagreeing with with him a lot lately. Of course, you're not a drunk and a loser [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11209.46s)]
*  well [[03:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11215.06s)]
*  You know that letter he wrote to a friend [[03:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11216.18s)]
*  And um, uh find what you love and let it kill you yeah that line, yeah [[03:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11218.26s)]
*  Yeah, I think that he was referring to love there like like a like a romantic partner I think [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11225.300000000001s)]
*  That's something I also like I depending on the day I disagree with [[03:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11232.5s)]
*  I agree and disagree with that. So basically find the thing you're passionate about and let it destroy you [[03:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11236.26s)]
*  Well, one of the reasons why he resonates obviously i'm joking around about him being a loser [[03:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11240.66s)]
*  He's a very successful guy [[03:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11244.9s)]
*  But one of the things that resonates with him with a lot of people is the pain like the like there's something in his writing [[03:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11246.42s)]
*  Where his his pain and his frustration? It's very [[03:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11254.34s)]
*  it's [[03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11259.86s)]
*  It's very tangible [[03:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11261.22s)]
*  And it resonates with people you feel it you feel it in his writing, you know [[03:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11263.3s)]
*  And then when you see him you realize who he was [[03:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11267.86s)]
*  Like that's all real [[03:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11270.26s)]
*  You know like you ever see when he gets mad at people in the audience and he's yelling at them in the audience and some [[03:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11271.7s)]
*  Of his uh, his readings he's drunk and he's just reading off of his poetry fascinating guy and the authenticity [[03:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11275.78s)]
*  Like there's something deeply authentic about that, right? That's not an act. That's who he is [[03:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11284.02s)]
*  Well, so that's what this poem is about. It's called so you want to be a writer [[03:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11288.74s)]
*  It's a bit aggressive. Okay [[03:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11292.58s)]
*  If it doesn't come bursting out of you in spite of everything don't do it [[03:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11295.14s)]

*  If you have to sit for hours staring at your computer screen or hunched over your typewriter searching for words [[03:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11306.98s)]

*  If you have to wait for it to roar out of you then wait patiently if it never does roar out of you do something else [[03:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11331.7s)]
*  If you first have to read it to your wife to your girlfriend or your boyfriend or your parents or to anybody at all [[03:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11339.14s)]
*  You're not ready [[03:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11346.1s)]
*  Don't be like so many writers. Don't be like so many thousands of people who call themselves writers [[03:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11347.46s)]
*  Don't be dull and boring and pretentious. Don't be consumed with self-love [[03:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11353.779999999999s)]

*  Unless the sun inside you is burning your gut. Don't do it [[03:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11374.5s)]
*  When it is truly time and if you have been chosen [[03:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11378.98s)]
*  It will do it by itself and it will keep on doing it until you die or it dies in you [[03:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dkk9-cPpH8&t=11382.9s)]
