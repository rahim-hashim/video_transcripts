# Joe Rogan Experience #2159 - Sal Vulcano
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I13JHxPaY20)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  What's up, Sal?
*  What's up, brother?
*  How you doing?
*  Good to see you, man.
*  What's cracking?
*  Not that, thanks.
*  Thanks for having me, man.
*  My pleasure.
*  What are you doing out here, man?
*  What are you doing in Austin, Texas?
*  I got a, my special comes out today, actually.
*  Oh, shit.
*  Yeah, special.
*  Terrified.
*  What's it on?
*  YouTube.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I'm very happy when guys do that.
*  Makes it easily accessible.
*  It's the best thing for distributing your stuff.
*  People share it easy.
*  It's nice that that's a good option now because when everybody turns you down, it's a great
*  option.
*  It's still like, well, I still got a good option.
*  I would think about it even if it, you know, even if I had other options.
*  At this point, right?
*  I think it's like the best distribution plot as long as they don't fucking censor you,
*  which is a little bit of an issue.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, Google and it's just like whenever you're dealing with these giant corporations
*  and there's all these fucking woke kids working for them, it's a lot of sketchy things happen.
*  Yeah.
*  But as far as a platform, it's the best.
*  It's great, right?
*  Oh, it's so good.
*  I don't really like, I'm not like edgy like that.
*  So I don't really have anything.
*  My edgiest stuff is not that edgy.
*  That's good.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, that's lucky.
*  Yeah.
*  Because like Ari Shaffir, when he was putting his out, I was like, sure.
*  He executive produced it.
*  Oh, he executive produced yours?
*  Oh, that's nice.
*  I'm going really tight.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what?
*  We were just talking about someone gave him shit for releasing his on YouTube.
*  I'm like, you're so short-sighted.
*  That's so stupid.
*  I'm looking at it now.
*  Yeah, it's fucking huge.
*  What does it have like 7 million downloads or something like that?
*  Yeah.
*  People are stupid, man.
*  They just have this silly idea of like these gatekeepers, these fucking institutions, which,
*  you know, look, you got a Netflix special.
*  It's great.
*  Like the Tom Brody roasts, great.
*  I'm happy Netflix is doing cool shit like that.
*  It's awesome.
*  But do you watch the throw three hours?
*  No.
*  Tony Hinchcliffe set and Andrew Schultz set.
*  That's it.
*  See Nicky's?
*  I heard Nicky's was awesome.
*  I heard Nicky killed it.
*  Yeah, she killed it.
*  She goes hard.
*  Yeah.
*  Tony, she does it.
*  She kills those roasts, man.
*  She kills those roasts.
*  She's really good at roasts.
*  She's strong.
*  She's got strong delivery.
*  You know, she's got and even like when she was shitting on Jeff Ross, I did see that
*  part when she was apologizing to him while she was shitting on him, which is so Nicky
*  Grazer.
*  She's so sweet.
*  That Hinchcliffe one with the liver king.
*  You look like the, I don't want to fuck it up, but the liver king and the tiger king
*  had a baby that looked like Martin Luther King.
*  He got beat up by Rodney King.
*  And bit by Lion King and some shit like that.
*  I don't hear nothing.
*  It was a ride.
*  It was such a ride.
*  By the time he finished it, it was just like, if he was one king shorter, I didn't think
*  it would hit as well.
*  But that king was the perfect, it was five kings, I think.
*  It was a monster bit.
*  And then the other one with Jeff is so Jewish, he only watches football for the coin toss.
*  I fucking love a roast.
*  I'd love a good roast joke.
*  You know what's so funny?
*  It's like this, you know, the Jewish, it's like, you know where you're going with Jeff
*  or, you know, or Jewish or whatever, but it's like, you still, it's still like, I still
*  find a new way to be like, you watch this with a coin toss.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I've felt that joke a million ways.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  But you still, I'm still like, oh my God, that's such a good way to tell it.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just, it's, I think people have relaxed more with comedy over the last year or so
*  for whatever reason.
*  It feels like it dipped a little bit, that whole.
*  I feel like people are tired of it all.
*  They realize that it's all just fucking sanctimonious horse shit.
*  Want any coffee?
*  We've got some coffee.
*  Maybe you have to throw a coat.
*  Oh, throw a coat.
*  We do a lot of shows.
*  Actually, I have.
*  We got the COVID.
*  No, I'm on my, my, my babe got me.
*  My baby got me sick.
*  That'll do it.
*  Yeah.
*  Those little kids get sick a lot.
*  Yeah.
*  She, I was like fighting for a while and then a few days ago it just took a dive.
*  Do you take vitamins?
*  Every single day and I get mocked for it.
*  You should not get mocked.
*  My dad growing up, he used to take, we had one cabinet in the kitchen, one that we opened
*  it and it was basically a mini GNC, not like GNC, but it was like just an every day, my
*  whole life I'd watch him throw down like 30, you know, pills and just swing it.
*  You know?
*  Yeah.
*  And, but me, I just, I feel like I have a weak immune system.
*  I got a weak constitution.
*  Yeah.
*  So like I, I try to take like the, like the, I take like the liposome also.
*  It's all like I take a D, a B, a C. I was taking like a multi and then you start hearing,
*  oh, it doesn't absorb and you got to take this one and that one.
*  So I take all immunity stuff.
*  Echinacea, elderberry.
*  What the fuck else do I think?
*  What do you think causes your weak immune system?
*  You ever thought about it?
*  Yeah.
*  I think about it my whole entire life.
*  What do you think it is?
*  Is it just a genetic thing?
*  I don't know.
*  Cause no one else in my family is like that.
*  So that, that's what led me to becoming like a little bit of a germaphobe because you want
*  to call it germaphobe, but I just know that if I put myself in the way of like, if someone
*  sneezes, if I put myself in that, sometimes I can get a common cold.
*  How long does it take you to get rid of the common cold?
*  Like a day.
*  Yeah.
*  But you're like you eat Elkin.
*  Yeah.
*  Just, you know, I've had a few that last a couple of days, but it's usually one day before
*  I don't feel good, but I've only had a couple of those recently and I assumed they were
*  the new COVID.
*  Oh really?
*  Yeah.
*  I assume you got it today.
*  Yeah.
*  I assume this last one I got was the new COVID.
*  This last one I got, I didn't even do the IV vitamins.
*  I was just too busy to sit down and just, what are they calling it?
*  New Coke, like new Coke.
*  There's so many strains, dude.
*  I think we did a thing where they were trying to, we were reading about it online where
*  they were trying to document all the strains and how many were they up to, Jamie?
*  It's a crazy number.
*  There's a lot of strains.
*  I thought there was like four strains.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  There's dozens.
*  Yeah.
*  They keep coming around.
*  New ones come around, new variants come around.
*  You know, what they're saying is like, this is just how we're going to be forever.
*  That stuff's just out there in the wild now.
*  Yeah.
*  Those little gremlins.
*  So that doesn't bode well for me, but I, common cold, one, two weeks, men.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  I've had a cold like five, six weeks many times.
*  Wow.
*  Lingering, not like full on.
*  Do you ever do IV vitamins?
*  I've only done it twice in my life.
*  It's so funny.
*  When I shot the special in December in Chicago and the day of I woke up and I had a cold
*  just because I was just running myself into the ground.
*  Right?
*  My throat was like, it was hurting me.
*  It was like scratchy.
*  I, my voice was raspy and I had like no energy.
*  I'm like, ah, freaking the fuck out.
*  Right?
*  So I get to the theater and I'm telling them like, I don't know what to do.
*  Like I feel so weak.
*  I got to do something.
*  So Ari's feeding me these all day long.
*  He's feeding me these Barocca tablets.
*  They're like these vitamin dissolving tablets.
*  Right.
*  He's into those.
*  Yeah.
*  They're like a hundred, you know, a billion percent, whatever.
*  Right?
*  So he's feeding me those.
*  And then I get to the place and they get me the IV and the guy gives me a B12 shot.
*  And then I had just started Vyvanse.
*  What's that?
*  It's for ADHD.
*  So it's like an Adderall almost.
*  Oh no.
*  And I had just started it a few days earlier.
*  So I'm like, not really, it hasn't really like, I'm not really regulated to it yet.
*  And I just didn't realize that his, the tablets Ari would give me, I looked back afterwards
*  and they were like, they all had caffeine.
*  And then I got this B12 shot 20 minutes before the first show and I was on the Vyvanse, which
*  is Adderall and it was the highest dose.
*  I didn't realize that this was all happening to me.
*  And like three minutes before I went out, I was the most wired I ever was in my entire
*  life of 40.
*  Like I just was, I was like literally, and then I had the adrenaline just cause it was
*  the first taping.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Oh my God.
*  And I was ready to stroke out.
*  I was holding my hand and it was doing this.
*  Oh Jesus Christ.
*  You gave me three of these things today.
*  Every one of them has 200 milligrams of caffeine.
*  Oh my God.
*  He's like, I didn't give you three.
*  I'm like, you gave me three.
*  You didn't give me, you gave, how do you look me in the face?
*  We were both there.
*  It's not like I'm here in the second hand.
*  And then the B, I think the B12 shot just put it over the top.
*  Oh my God.
*  And it was like, just the combination time was bad.
*  I didn't use one second from show one.
*  Oh my God.
*  So one second, is it like a Adderall or is it like a Cous?
*  It's Adderall.
*  It's basically Adderall.
*  Yeah, it's like same exact thing.
*  And why did you think you needed that?
*  Why do you think you needed Adderall?
*  I mean, I suffer from ADHD and a little OCD for like my whole life.
*  And what does that mean?
*  Like when you say ADHD, how does it manifest itself in your life?
*  So many ways.
*  Mainly the thing that affects my life is I can't focus.
*  I can't focus on something for, especially if I'm like this up and down days, but I can't
*  focus on something for more than like, if I'm trying to complete something, I will complete
*  it.
*  Like what kind of stuff?
*  Like if I'm writing or if I have just stuff to do, paying anything at all, paying bills,
*  anything that I have to use my mind.
*  Like I'll plant my ass down and I'll be trying to like write or send an email or whatever.
*  My leg is shaking like crazy because I don't want to sit there.
*  And I just, it's helped because I can multitask like 500 things at once.
*  But it also hurts because I, it's really hard to get something done.
*  I can't remember anything.
*  So I only, I have like 50 lists in my phone.
*  They're all labeled and prioritized.
*  That helps me.
*  But I have to use that.
*  Otherwise I won't remember anything.
*  Right.
*  I have trouble reading.
*  Like I'll read a page and then I will like, I have no idea what was on the page.
*  I have to read the page again.
*  So I ended up reading really slow.
*  Is it with everything you read or is it only some stuff?
*  Is there anything that you read where that's not a problem?
*  Books are tough, like long form reading.
*  Like fiction or nonfiction?
*  Like just a lot of pages in between two covers.
*  The genre doesn't play into the fact.
*  So not even like a really, like there's not one book that just captivated you and you
*  like easily could read it?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean that's, I mean when I'm really, I mean, like I said, there's good and bad days.
*  So like, if I'm reading like a biography or I'm really into it, I don't really read fiction.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Yeah.
*  But I like biographies really.
*  So if something like that, you know, but honestly it's really tough.
*  I actually, I really don't read as much as, you know, how many books I've bought?
*  I have a lot of books, but I just, so many aren't open.
*  I have one day I'm going to read that.
*  I have this guilt that I think about that.
*  I know I'm not going to do it.
*  I'm like, I owe it to myself to read all these books and I just keep picturing myself like
*  on my deathbed being like the books.
*  I just want to read that book.
*  It's wasted money.
*  It is, but it's also, it's nice to have books in your house.
*  It is.
*  I have this weird theory about books that I haven't read that are cool.
*  It's like, at least they're near me.
*  At least I'm getting the energy off of that book, that really good book.
*  Like whoever wrote it, whatever it is.
*  Yeah, I can see that.
*  I know that book's awesome.
*  It's sitting right there.
*  I can't even listen to audio.
*  You think audio books would be the solve?
*  It doesn't help you?
*  No, I can't listen to someone, unless it's really, really good, but it's hard to listen
*  to someone drone on.
*  It's hard, but a lot of them are really good at it.
*  There's some really good voice over actor guys, including they do fiction, so they do
*  a bunch of different voices.
*  It's a real art form now.
*  It's almost like old timey radio stories or something.
*  Yeah, that I love.
*  I love it.
*  My buddy I do a show with, he has a bunch of books out published.
*  One of the things we have ... When does this come out?
*  He's going to ... I don't know if I'm supposed to say.
*  We keep a lot of secrets from each other and then surprise each other on the show.
*  If you don't know, people don't know, it's just called Impractical Jokers.
*  Me and my buddies have 35 years.
*  Fucking huge show, dude.
*  It's gigantic.
*  It's crazy.
*  Congratulations.
*  Thank you so much.
*  Thank you, man.
*  I remember when guys were talking about it in the parking lot of the store when it was
*  blowing up and people were talking about your shows that you were doing.
*  You guys were doing shows and they were just mobbed and everybody's like, that show is
*  huge.
*  Yeah, it was wild.
*  Not expected or anything.
*  It was on true TV.
*  Yeah, which is like not a network where people really blow up from.
*  There's a few though, but it just shows you if something's fun, people find it.
*  Yeah, well, there was nothing like it.
*  They only did ... They had, no joke, they had two different pawn shows.
*  This is when we got on.
*  Two different pawn shows, three different towing shows and two storage shows.
*  That was the whole ... And then they showed the stupidest criminals of all time.
*  And that was it.
*  So we were the first comedy.
*  So I guess it kind of resonated on the channel because we were alone in that manner.
*  I heard a lot of those storage shows are for gazing.
*  So much of all the reality stuff is ... Oh, a lot of it is, yeah.
*  I mean, I'd say 95%.
*  There's a lot of finagling going on behind the scenes with the truth, just for narratives.
*  If you pause the credits, there's always that fine print in the credits.
*  I think they have to say that.
*  They're allowed to ... They use it to create a theatrical piece that's not necessarily
*  representative of what actually happened.
*  I mean, bro, they've been looking for Bigfoot for nine seasons now.
*  Well, no, it's more than that, right?
*  How many seasons is Finding Bigfoot?
*  Versions of the show that are like refinding them or resurfacing them.
*  Refinding them.
*  Refinding them.
*  Looking again.
*  So many fucking dorks in the woods looking for nothing.
*  Even ghosts.
*  It's like ... I mean, people ... I'm more interested in ghosts than I am Bigfoot.
*  Me too.
*  Because the thing about Bigfoot is I think it was probably a real animal and I think
*  there's some ancient stories that are passed down for thousands of years.
*  Sure.
*  I think that's probably what it was.
*  Ghosts are weird because they're in every culture.
*  Right.
*  And I haven't experienced a ghost, but I imagine if I did, trying to explain it to someone
*  and not sounding like a fucking maniac, like just a crazy person.
*  Oh, I saw a ghost.
*  Let me try.
*  Okay, you've seen one?
*  Didn't see one, but here's the thing.
*  I don't believe in ghosts.
*  Oh, okay.
*  But then I had this happen to me and now I don't really know what to feel.
*  Cue the spooky music.
*  Any spooky music over there, Jamie?
*  My family believes in ghosts.
*  They're all for it.
*  My sister had a thing.
*  She lived at home and she came home one day and she opened the door to her room and every
*  single one of her closet drawers were open.
*  Every single thing that could be open in the room was open.
*  And it freaked her out a little bit.
*  And she asked if anyone did it.
*  And it was just my stepmom, my dad.
*  They said no.
*  And she felt uncomfortable about that.
*  And then she closed everything.
*  And then whatever, she used to lock it after that.
*  One day, like months later, she had locked it.
*  She came home, she opened it, they were all open again.
*  I tell her, I don't even believe.
*  I don't know what, she's not lying to me, but I don't know what to make of it.
*  But I don't think it's a ghost.
*  But my grandfather-
*  That's not that spooky.
*  That's like the Hulk.
*  I was about to get a massage.
*  Yeah, that was like waiting for the candles to be lit.
*  But my grandfather died in the house.
*  But like, I don't know.
*  But this is not, that's not what I'm saying.
*  One night, I was home.
*  There we go.
*  It was foggy out.
*  And, no, sorry.
*  So I used to live alone.
*  And I'm just, I'm in bed.
*  And I'm laying in bed.
*  My television is on.
*  And I do lock, even when I live alone, I lock my bedroom door when I go to sleep.
*  I lock my bathroom door when I'm taking a shower.
*  I always have.
*  Right?
*  So my door's locked.
*  And I'm laying there and I'm watching TV.
*  I sleep with a CPAP.
*  Right?
*  So what's good about that is like, I can go all the way under the covers like a cocoon.
*  And I still have a form to breathe.
*  So I like wrap myself in like a fucking burrito for real.
*  It's so delightful.
*  With a CPAP sheet.
*  And you breathe, you're scuba diving.
*  There's just a hose coming out of it.
*  Bro, you're scuba diving and you sleep.
*  That's so crazy.
*  So I love it.
*  So I wrap myself over my head and everything.
*  And what I really do, like what's really fun when you're in there is to like just poke
*  out a foot or a hand and just get like a cool breeze.
*  And then wonder about what's under the bed's gonna bite your feet.
*  Sure, a little bit.
*  It depends on the night, right?
*  But like, you know.
*  That foot's out there dangling.
*  It does feel very calm.
*  I don't like haunts.
*  I will tell you that.
*  I don't believe in ghosts, but like haunted houses and scares.
*  We can get into that later.
*  Wait a minute.
*  What's the difference?
*  What are they haunted by?
*  Well, like, you know, like fake ones even, I'm saying.
*  I don't even like, I don't even like the go through.
*  Okay.
*  You know, I don't like that shit, but it's not that's less about funny because the guy
*  likes to play jokes on people.
*  You think?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, well, I do.
*  I really play jokes.
*  I don't know if I would.
*  I do really.
*  It's like pranks.
*  Yeah, it's like the four of us.
*  It's fun.
*  Yeah.
*  They think it's crazy shit we did.
*  But you don't like a good haunted house.
*  They jump out of nowhere and scare the fuck out of you.
*  I'll tell you how much I don't like that.
*  We we went on the show.
*  They know I don't like it.
*  They created one time they put me in a cornfield and they made it haunted and I had to navigate
*  it and then the next time they upped it and they got an old mansion and they completely
*  built it all out and made it haunted and I just put me in there, locked the door and
*  made me alone in the mansion.
*  And it's.
*  Did you want to really see like a collection of shit that'll freak you out?
*  Go to Zach Bagans thing in Vegas.
*  Oh, is that that like thing where they get really weird with you?
*  He's got this.
*  Like is a visceral thing like they put a gun in your throat and stuff?
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  No, he's got this crazy mansion in Vegas that's like a museum of haunted shit, a museum of
*  like like they have Dr.
*  Kevorkian, the van where he killed people.
*  They have the van.
*  Yeah, they have a bunch of stuff that Ted Bundy owned and a bunch of stuff that Ed Gain
*  owned.
*  Yeah, it's a it's a creepy fucking play.
*  This is the one I had the thing on my.
*  This is the.
*  Stupid.
*  Oh, you're gross.
*  Yeah, I mean, look, see, now I know what I had to threaten that girl because I know,
*  look, here's the deal.
*  She's not a ghost.
*  I know she's not even crazy.
*  I just mean I just don't like be the jump scares.
*  I don't like it.
*  Like in the cornfield, they've had a little girl.
*  Right.
*  And I was 20 minutes into this cornfield.
*  Where's the little label laws here?
*  This girl's just stand there waiting for me.
*  She's in like a dress.
*  She's a little girl with pigtails.
*  And I see her in the distance and I go, is that a little girl?
*  And then she just raised her hand and pointed at me.
*  And I had to follow this path that they laid out and it went past.
*  It had to go past the girl.
*  Right.
*  I don't know how to explain it, man.
*  I know that I know that they did this to me.
*  Right.
*  I was like, I will.
*  I know you're a little girl, but I will fucking punch you.
*  I told her.
*  I think when I went past, I'm like, I know you're a girl.
*  I was like, look, I know I can beat you up.
*  Don't jump scare me because I'm liable to punch you.
*  I'm letting you know right now.
*  That was the little girl.
*  But wait, so I'll double back on this one.
*  So I warned is fucking scary to get lost in corn maze.
*  Yeah, it's terrible.
*  It's really weird.
*  Like there's a place in California where they have a farm and they have a corn maze.
*  You can walk around this maze.
*  It's fun because you know you can eventually get out going alone lost in this maze.
*  You get really lost and it's kind of confusing.
*  And now imagine this is thousands of acres.
*  And you're in the center of it with no water and you have no idea.
*  You might be walking around in circles.
*  You really have no idea.
*  You may as well be on like the mountains when people die.
*  Yeah, people die in corn fields, man.
*  That's a real thing.
*  I mean, I feel like, yeah, it depends how dense it is.
*  I mean, if I was ever in that situation, I'd just go straight and not stop.
*  I wonder how many people over in history have died in corn fields.
*  Just heat exhaustion.
*  Eleven.
*  Get lost.
*  Eleven.
*  Yeah, that's what you think.
*  We had looked it up.
*  For real?
*  No.
*  Let's guess.
*  Let's say yes.
*  I want to guess, but then I think eleven is a solid number.
*  I think eleven is a good guess.
*  Like eleven people over the course of America have died in corn fields.
*  No, back in the day.
*  A lot.
*  Think about that.
*  But they didn't have monocrop agriculture back then.
*  I don't even know what that is.
*  That's like these giant corn fields.
*  Where like in this country right now, look this up, because I think it's true.
*  I think five percent of the landmass of the United States is being used for corn fields.
*  That's still, that's crazy.
*  That's fucking crazy.
*  That's wild.
*  That's so crazy.
*  I think that's correct.
*  The guy on my show that I was.
*  By the way, I just read the headline of that.
*  I'll be real clear.
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't even read the whole article.
*  I just read the whole article.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Well, this guy, he just might not be correct.
*  He put a corn field in his yard.
*  He has five acres.
*  He built a corn field registered as a farm so he could get tax breaks.
*  He has to sell $50,000 worth of corn in order to get it.
*  So how much do that right now?
*  How much corn is $50,000 worth of corn?
*  No clue.
*  It feels like a lot to me.
*  Isn't it funny?
*  Because you've seen the government subsidizes corn.
*  It's wild.
*  Well, you know where it all came from?
*  It came from World War II.
*  So during the war, people need food and they wanted to make sure that in the future they
*  would have stockpiles of food.
*  The war just ended, but who knows what's going to happen now with Russia.
*  We could be into it again.
*  Let's prepare.
*  And they started subsidizing corn production.
*  Then they just started using corn for all kinds of extra stuff that you're not supposed
*  to use it for like oil or corn syrup.
*  That stuff's fucking.
*  I can't find the percentage, which I'm trying to get to, but I've got 97 million acres,
*  which is about the same size as California.
*  What?
*  Wow.
*  Oh, there's no shortage of that.
*  There's so much corn.
*  Okay, so like what percentage that is?
*  California's got to be more than 5% of the country, right?
*  No, it's tough because they're not counting Alaska.
*  Right, Alaska is so big.
*  Alaska's like way bigger than Texas and Texas is enormous.
*  I think Alaska is like three Texas's.
*  Really?
*  What percentage of that corn do you think we're consuming and what's going to waste?
*  I don't know if it's a waste thing.
*  It just goes because you can use it for so many different things.
*  You can use it to make alcohol.
*  You can use it to make corn syrup.
*  You can use it to make oil.
*  I think they're just, it's like a money racket.
*  It's like they've cornered this market and people were better off when they were using
*  actual sugar and people were better off when they weren't eating corn syrup and fucking
*  everything.
*  It's just not good for you.
*  And then, you know, what people think is corn or canola oil, that's not canola oil.
*  That's rapeseed oil.
*  That's an industrial lubricant that they figured out a way to refine down to the point where
*  human beings can eat it, not die immediately.
*  Put it on everything.
*  This is the first time I've really, in the last 10 years, whatever, when I was a kid,
*  we didn't eat it.
*  I mean, my parents, I love them, but we didn't eat fresh vegetables.
*  We got canned everything.
*  It says about a third of America's corn crop is used for feeding cattle, hogs, and poultry
*  in the U.S.
*  Corn provides the carbs in animal feed while soybeans provide the protein, takes a couple
*  bushels of American corn to make corn-fed steak.
*  By some estimates, a beef cow can eat a ton of corn if raised in a feedlot.
*  Both dairy cows and beef cows also consume silage, which is fermented corn stalks and
*  other green plants.
*  So a third of the corn crop is used to make ethanol, which serves as renewable fuel, additive
*  to gasoline.
*  The rest of the corn crop is used for human food, beverages, and industrial uses in the
*  U.S. or exported to other countries for food or feed use.
*  Corn is used to make breakfast cereal, tortilla chips, grits, canned beer, soda, cooking oil,
*  biodegradable packing materials.
*  Have you ever watched that documentary King Corn?
*  No.
*  It's great.
*  It's a good one to watch.
*  It's a giant industry that's not good for us.
*  It's like all the things that it does.
*  You can do it with other things and you'll be better off.
*  Right, right, right.
*  It's captive.
*  It'll never change.
*  Also corn on the cob is fucking delicious.
*  That's the best corn.
*  That's the best form of corn.
*  There's nothing wrong with corn.
*  I love corn on the cob.
*  Corn's great.
*  I like, um, why is it so much better off with corn?
*  Corn soup, cream of corn soup is great.
*  I haven't had that in my life.
*  Oh, I love that.
*  I maybe had that three times in my life.
*  Cream corn, veero, cream corn, like at a steakhouse.
*  Corn's great.
*  Don't get me wrong.
*  But on the cob, it's like the sweet corn.
*  That sweet corn with butter.
*  When you take the butter and the butter like takes on the shape of the corn cob because
*  you're just reckless.
*  You're running a whole stick of butter around that.
*  Feel the whole, that's how I do it.
*  You hold the stick and go like this.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Dude, fucking sweet corn, fresh off the grill with butter.
*  One of the best things in the world.
*  Oh my god.
*  So delicious.
*  Three, four of those things.
*  So delicious.
*  I don't know why they're better.
*  And you take that same exact corn and you like kind of put it, just take it off.
*  It's good, but it's just better on the cob.
*  It's also you're getting the melted butter in all the curls and it's in your mouth while
*  you're biting into it.
*  Oh yeah.
*  You know what else they use corn cobs for?
*  What?
*  In the 1800s?
*  Pipes.
*  Popeye.
*  No, before toilet paper.
*  Whoa.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  To wipe their asses?
*  Can you imagine how rough their assholes were back then?
*  Because it catches, why?
*  Because of the shape.
*  Because they had it I think.
*  Because they just were just dummies.
*  They were living in a dumb ass time.
*  Early North American sailors used corn cob.
*  They were abundant, soft and easy to handle.
*  Look at the sailors use something they call a toe rag.
*  By the way, back then they didn't even run in water so it's not like they washed these
*  things off.
*  You're a sailor with a corn cob.
*  You're going to use that corn cob over and over again.
*  You're going to be smearing new shit over the area where the old shit's dried up.
*  They dangled it in the water to clean it off.
*  A bit of a dangle.
*  Fix it up, lad.
*  You ever think about how people would have sex back then?
*  How would people still fuck back then?
*  They were disgusting things.
*  Think about how many years.
*  It's only like the last hundred years that people aren't disgusting.
*  We were talking about St. Agnes who went his whole life.
*  Was it St. Agnes?
*  Yeah, I mean back then.
*  Anyway, take a pic.
*  Was his whole life without having a bath.
*  His whole life.
*  He copped to that?
*  Yeah, once a year it was a lot.
*  That wasn't even that.
*  It was like you were supposed to do that.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah, like bathing was thought of as like a ridiculous thing to do.
*  I mean day three it starts to be a problem.
*  How long did he live?
*  I don't know what happens.
*  I wonder what happens.
*  What just happens if you never bathe?
*  We just assume that you have to bathe.
*  Maybe that's the source of a lot of our problems.
*  We're not covered in dirt and bacteria all the time.
*  We're supposed to be like a normal animal.
*  Maybe that warded off.
*  Maybe that warded off.
*  I bet it.
*  Nah, it didn't stop red.
*  No, not at all.
*  You don't think a T-Rex would be like ugh.
*  I don't know how we made it so far.
*  I really don't.
*  I really don't.
*  I don't understand it.
*  I mean I know it was the invention of weapons and tools and stuff and building houses but
*  god damn we're so weak.
*  Like how much different were we back then?
*  We are so fucking weak.
*  I just can't imagine us without the houses and the weapons.
*  Like how did we even make it that far?
*  And how much of a change was it once we developed the houses and the weapons?
*  We are so bitch ass as an animal.
*  Even if you're fit and in shape.
*  Even if you're a UFC fighter.
*  You're like Islam Akhachev.
*  To compare to the nature world, our animal species is so bitch ass.
*  We're so bitch ass.
*  It's insane that we made it this far.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  I guess just...
*  Just the fact that we even survived to the point where we made a bow and arrow.
*  Like how?
*  How did everything not just run up on us and eat us?
*  I don't know.
*  And it's like the day...
*  I always think about this too.
*  The first...
*  There's always the first time, first person.
*  There was one person who was like, oh shit, hold on a second.
*  I guess.
*  I guess they probably like stepped on things and cut themselves with it and then realized
*  they could pick those things up and cut other things with it and then they figured out how
*  to make those things.
*  Yeah.
*  And then we got email.
*  Then we got email.
*  Fast forward.
*  Fast forward you got AI.
*  Yeah.
*  Fast forward.
*  Yeah, I mean, could you fucking imagine being born in Africa 500,000 years ago?
*  If you put me in Africa now, if you put me in a forest right now, if you put me anywhere
*  right now, I'm done.
*  I don't know how to make a fire.
*  I don't know how to...
*  I don't know anything.
*  I can't explain anything.
*  I can't explain to you how mirrors work.
*  There's some places like I was reading this thing.
*  No, it was actually Paul Rosalie.
*  Paul Rosalie was talking about this.
*  If you get caught in the Amazon, do not try to make a fire because you won't be able to
*  and it'll break your spirit.
*  You're not going to be able to make a fire.
*  I didn't think that's where you're going with that.
*  If you're lost in the Amazon, forget a fire.
*  It's not going to happen.
*  Your broken spirit will kill you before the elements?
*  You will realize how hopeless your plight is when it is impossible for you to make
*  a fire.
*  Now you're going to realize that everything that you eat is going to be raw and you're
*  going to have to catch things and eat them raw to stay alive.
*  Now you're an animal.
*  No.
*  I don't even know.
*  I'd be trying to catch a smallest animal and strangle it.
*  What am I going to do?
*  The likelihood of them finding you is so small.
*  If you just go on a walkabout, if you're like some wacky dude who goes off his meds and
*  decides to go on a walkabout in the Amazon, they're not going to find you.
*  So many walkabouts just don't turn out well.
*  A lot of them don't.
*  Why keep walking about it?
*  Why are walkabouts so romantic to us?
*  That movie with a kid who, what was the movie called?
*  Where he lived in the bus in Alaska?
*  Into the Wild?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Why is that so romantic to us?
*  For someone who just goes out into the wild and even if the dude dies out there like that
*  guy did.
*  Maybe there's some type of like, whether it be just finding yourself or like just being
*  at one with these elements as much as possible feels like something romantic, I guess.
*  Yeah.
*  It feels like this understanding that we're disconnected from the rest of the world because
*  of what we created.
*  It gives perspective for sure.
*  Perspective.
*  It does give you perspective.
*  That's also like, the more disconnected we are, the more ridiculous we behave.
*  Where do people behave the most ridiculously?
*  In big cities.
*  The most disconnected from nature.
*  The most.
*  You're living in concrete jungles, honk honk, fuck you.
*  You're living in New York City, you're disconnected from nature.
*  Period.
*  Fuck your park.
*  Park's cute.
*  Yeah, park's cute.
*  It's surrounded by New York City.
*  It's so unnatural.
*  It's so contained.
*  It's actually contained by the city.
*  The park is contained.
*  It's not peaceful.
*  It's peaceful enough.
*  It's a nice park.
*  It's a lovely park.
*  Have you been through it all?
*  Have you been through it all?
*  Yeah, I've been through the park.
*  It's lovely.
*  Because it's like, I thought I went to it, but then one day I really went to it.
*  I went to every area, which is there's so many things I didn't know.
*  It's really big.
*  There's like 50 things, like places.
*  It's a beautiful thing about New York City that they have that park in the center of
*  it.
*  It really changes the dynamic of the city.
*  It does.
*  It makes the city a more livable place, a more friendly place.
*  Absolutely.
*  I mean, it's crazy that you have this insane urban environment, and then inside you have
*  this massive park.
*  It's like another world in there.
*  But the difference between that and the woods, the actual woods, like the Colorado Rockies,
*  the difference being out there and waking up and just looking and all you see in front
*  of you is mountain peak after mountain peak after mountain peak and it just goes along.
*  That is a different feeling.
*  That's the real feeling.
*  I think that feeling is like a thing we're supposed to get.
*  I think that's supposed to be a part of our requirements of being a human being that we
*  connect with the earth.
*  That the earth sees us, we see it, we're out there in it, and we realize our actual place.
*  We get all cocky in our fucking Uber in New York City, get now, buying a slice, and you
*  think you're all disconnected.
*  We think we're better than them.
*  But we're just trapped in our own little fucking zoo, the little zoo that we've created.
*  But when you go out in the world, you feel so vulnerable.
*  You go out into the woods, you feel so, so minuscule, but connected.
*  Connected.
*  But you're right, you start to feel where our place is.
*  We are not as, we are bitch ass.
*  Bitch ass.
*  That's right, that's a bitch, that first wave that comes over you is a bitch ass wave.
*  Bitch ass.
*  Right?
*  Compared to all the other things, bitch ass.
*  I don't think I'm catching anything.
*  I don't think I'm going to kill anything.
*  What do you think you feel like when you, you're not even at a point where it just happened,
*  but you know you ain't getting out of it.
*  So it's like, your survival mode is going to kick in.
*  How long you last, I don't know.
*  You're probably going to shock.
*  Like a bear grabs you, you're probably just going to shock.
*  Well I had this conversation yesterday actually, so would you be able to play dead?
*  It depends on what the bear wants, man.
*  See, there's two types of bears.
*  Black bears and brown bears.
*  I don't see colors.
*  This is two types of bears in North America.
*  The black bears, they're also brown too.
*  A lot of black bears are very, even blonde, they look blonde sometimes.
*  They're called color-phased bears.
*  But they're more like, black bears are more likely to try to eat you.
*  Oh, I thought the opposite.
*  They're more likely, no, they're more likely to try to bite you and kill you to eat you.
*  Whereas brown bears, for the most part, when they're killing people.
*  Like grizzlies?
*  Yes.
*  Brown bears are, the big ones are the ones that are the coastal bears, because they have
*  access to all the seafood.
*  That's why those are like, those Kodiak bears.
*  Enormous, enormous grizzly bears.
*  But it's the same bear, it's the same species.
*  It's just you have the inland one, which is eating mostly animals and berries and shit
*  like that.
*  And then you have the coastal ones, just gorging in salmon.
*  And so they're fucking huge.
*  Yeah, they put me in a cage with two of them.
*  They're actually less likely to try to go after you, because they have an abundant food source.
*  There's people that camp out by the river and watch these enormous fucking bears just
*  eat salmon.
*  But the bears don't want to have nothing to do with you.
*  They're just eating salmon.
*  Like the revenant, right?
*  I don't care what kind of bear it is.
*  If there's a bear coming at you, the bear has bad intentions, black, brown, white.
*  And they tell you to lay down and just stay there.
*  I know that the bear's going to catch you if you keep running, but you think that you
*  could play dead in that moment?
*  No, it doesn't matter.
*  It'll still start eating you.
*  Right.
*  How do you get this advice?
*  Because if it's a mama bear, so if a mama bear goes after you because her cubs are there,
*  if you stump and you scare her, like if you come too close and she doesn't know you're
*  there, she thinks you're a predator, she may charge you.
*  She charges you and bites you and you should play dead.
*  You should play dead with her.
*  Because she's not trying to eat you.
*  She's just trying to protect her cubs.
*  She wants a knockout.
*  But it doesn't mean she won't eat you either.
*  How are you playing dead when she's chomped through this?
*  Sometimes she just wants to eliminate the threat and then get her babies to safety.
*  So that's why playing dead works with mama bears, sometimes.
*  So you're just hoping for a mama.
*  But it's a big sometimes.
*  It's a big sometimes.
*  Because sometimes they just eat you.
*  They're bears.
*  We don't have a fucking treaty with them.
*  That's why my strategy is just not to put myself in a place where there are bears.
*  That's a good move.
*  And look, it's worked so far.
*  That'll help you a lot in this life.
*  If you want to avoid getting eaten by bears, don't go to places where they live.
*  Have you come across one like that?
*  Like just in the wild?
*  The scariest thing I came across, I've talked about it too many times on the podcast, but
*  to tell you, I saw a big mountain line from about 30 yards away.
*  But I was inside my friend's truck.
*  And he spotted it.
*  It was about dusk.
*  It was in Utah in the mountains.
*  And we were taking this corner and he hits the brakes.
*  He goes, look at that cat.
*  And we look and about 30 yards away under a tree is this enormous, enormous mountain
*  line with like a head like a pumpkin, dude, and these giant forearms.
*  And it just sit in there were like, holy fuck, man.
*  And I had binoculars.
*  So I pick up the binos.
*  So I have these 10 power binoculars.
*  So I'm looking in its face.
*  Oh, shit.
*  But I'm protected.
*  I'm inside the car.
*  We have a gun.
*  I'm protected.
*  And I'm shitting my pants.
*  That's crazy.
*  It felt like it like some primal fear.
*  Some primal recognition of an actual monster.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That kicked in from the inside.
*  From inside a truck with a gun.
*  It doesn't matter.
*  With the binoculars.
*  Yeah.
*  Dude, you look at this thing and its eyes are kind of...
*  Because it's dusk, the eyes are kind of glowing a little bit.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  No, thank you.
*  No, thank you.
*  Those are the real monsters.
*  I had a Kali dog bite me once and I was that scared.
*  So it's like, I'm not going to go.
*  I'm not going to go.
*  Hey bro, if your cat wants to fuck you up, that's a real problem.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't do cats.
*  But imagine a cat that's 170 pounds.
*  Yeah.
*  Dude, it's so scary.
*  This is so big.
*  You ever see these guys on like Instagram, like they live with lions?
*  Oh, those guys are...
*  Like on the couch and they're like, come over and they just feed them like a sandwich.
*  We know Melanie Griffin grew up with lions.
*  No.
*  What?
*  The whole house was filled with lions.
*  Yeah.
*  How does that not something everybody knows?
*  Her house was free rolling lions?
*  No, no, no.
*  They had pet lions.
*  I mean, enormous pet lions.
*  There's all these photographs of her as a child in California.
*  Right?
*  Wasn't it?
*  But what did her family do?
*  Her family was kooky.
*  They were crazy lion people.
*  These were just kooky lion pets?
*  Yes.
*  It wasn't like they were like carnies or something like that?
*  No.
*  Crazy lion people and they did a movie with these lions.
*  And the movie is supposed to be like the dumbest movie of all time.
*  Illegal?
*  Was it illegal to do that?
*  This is the movie.
*  What's it called again?
*  Roar.
*  What is it, Jamie?
*  Roar.
*  So these are all their lions.
*  And a bunch of people got fucked up in the making of this movie too, by the way.
*  No shit.
*  I don't believe it.
*  Because they used actual real lions, man.
*  And so like they have fucking scenes.
*  Melanie Griffin is in this stupid movie.
*  All these clips of these actors right now.
*  Yeah, interacting with their pets.
*  Those are real lions?
*  Yes.
*  One of those people.
*  Yes.
*  How was that?
*  What was the insurance for that?
*  Insurance and schmorents.
*  The fuck out of here with your insurance.
*  They locked me in a motel room with a tiger.
*  A Bengal tiger.
*  In our movie.
*  In our Joker's movie.
*  They pushed me into a roadside hotel room, closed the door behind me.
*  I turned around.
*  There was no knob on the inside.
*  And I just was like, what is this for?
*  And I heard a grumbling.
*  And then literally I was like, I plastered up against the wall because I was like, you
*  know, it's just a white tiger just comes out of the bathroom.
*  Well how can they predict the behavior of that thing?
*  Yeah, that's what I fucking said too.
*  Bro, that's so dangerous.
*  And if you're freaking out.
*  It's on a chain.
*  It's on a chain which is.
*  What are you talking about?
*  It's chained to the pole in the shower.
*  Bro, I also want you to look at that bitch ass chain.
*  I thought you were going to say look at how strong those things are.
*  Look at that chain.
*  You don't think he can break that chain?
*  I know he could.
*  I was saying.
*  Bro, that is so crazy.
*  That's such a crazy thing to do.
*  I just forgot about that until this moment too.
*  Fuck those things.
*  I said to them, this isn't funny.
*  It's not funny.
*  It's not funny how to make the movie.
*  The first thing I said on camera is do we have insurance?
*  It's in the movie.
*  I couldn't even like play it up and I just it stayed in the fucking movie.
*  Dude.
*  Fuck that.
*  But Roy, Roy, look at that guy.
*  That guy, that was secretive Roy.
*  Yeah, same thing.
*  He raised that tiger from the time it was a baby.
*  And he would tell you.
*  They don't even know why it had.
*  There's all the speculation.
*  I mean, they think he was like some crazy hat on apparently.
*  And they think that like maybe the tiger was agitated by the lady.
*  But it's all just the tiger just decided to bite him.
*  Yeah.
*  If that's all it takes is that tiger to get agitated by a lady.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you're playing with your Russian roulette your whole life.
*  I mean, he would tell you a billion times over.
*  It's safe.
*  It's safe.
*  And then he gets he gets his throat cut out.
*  I don't think it tried to kill him, though.
*  I think it was carrying away like a cub.
*  Yeah, I think his limp body.
*  Did they show that?
*  Yeah.
*  I think they showed it, but I think they have it.
*  I don't think anybody's he didn't die though, right?
*  He died.
*  He died eventually, but he was paralyzed like a few hours later or no, he was paralyzed.
*  Yeah.
*  But he kept the tiger, right?
*  He was like, I figured it was the lady's fault.
*  You can't trust those things.
*  I was just because when it goes, he saw the one where the guy was he had a train grizzly
*  bear for a movie had been in a few movies.
*  And it just he's doing this thing with you.
*  And it just bites this guy's neck off.
*  Just jumps on this guy's neck and tears apart in front of everybody.
*  And there's nothing anyone could do about it.
*  The bear just jumps on him for no reason.
*  Dude's just standing there just totally standing still.
*  And the bear just decides I want to bite you.
*  Imagine what you feel in that moment.
*  No, no, no, you're going to die knowing that it's going to be this way.
*  Knowing that people are watching it can't help and you're going to die in front of like
*  your whole life.
*  When am I going?
*  How's it going?
*  You could it could have all been avoided.
*  Like, don't do that.
*  Don't get out there.
*  This is just not.
*  It's not 100 percent, kids, even if it's 99.9 percent that that little tiny one that when
*  the bear decides to just do what nature wants it to do.
*  Yeah.
*  They want to kill things, man.
*  It's part of the fun of being a bear.
*  It's part of the fun of being a tiger.
*  It's part of the fun.
*  They like to kill things.
*  That's how they survive.
*  There's a reward system that's built into their DNA.
*  And we have this stupid belief that we could just slide stakes under the door and they'll
*  be cool with that.
*  And then eventually they just want to get my own meat.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, you're not the boss of me.
*  So the tiger never attacked him during the Vegas show.
*  He saved my life.
*  I don't know, Roy.
*  I don't know if we're picking it up.
*  Why does he think the tiger saved his life?
*  I don't know exactly how it happened, but you said it like instinctively.
*  Oh, he said he might have been having a stroke.
*  Hold on a second.
*  Roy maintains that Monacor was really trying to drag him to safety after seeing him felled
*  by what he thinks may have been a stroke.
*  He said instinctively saw that I needed help and he helped me.
*  Oh, he was taking medication for high blood pressure for years.
*  Said he recently began to suffer dizzy spells.
*  And this one spell unfortunately occurred in the presence of a very large tiger.
*  He said I started feeling weak.
*  Still speaks slowly, but has recovered most of his German accented speech as I fell over.
*  Monacor saw that I was falling down.
*  So he actually took me and brought me to the other exit where everybody could get me and
*  help me.
*  He knew better than I did where to go.
*  So he's saying that the tiger fucked him up accidentally while it was dragging him to
*  safety.
*  That come out right away?
*  I mean, it's amazing if that's what happened, but they don't.
*  Tigers don't understand.
*  You can't just drag a dude by his neck.
*  Yeah, not like break it.
*  Yeah, because we're bitch ass.
*  He's like Lenny from The Vice and the Met.
*  You could do that to a puppy.
*  Two gaping puncture wounds to the neck.
*  Before passing out, recalls said leave Monacor alone.
*  Bring him back to his brother and sister.
*  Let him be happy.
*  These guys are so crazy.
*  I picture Roy James Redd.
*  Suffering from severe blood loss.
*  This picture of like just blood squirts.
*  He's like thank you.
*  Leave Monacor alone.
*  Thank you.
*  Leave him alone.
*  Just bring him back to his brother and sister.
*  Oh my God.
*  Suffering from severe blood loss and shock, he was considered medically dead at one point
*  when his heart stopped.
*  He also suffered the stroke that would ravage the left side of his body.
*  So was the stroke before or was the stroke because of him getting bitten?
*  He might be rationalizing.
*  He could have just had the stroke and that would be bad enough, but he could have just
*  had a stroke.
*  Do they know when he had the stroke?
*  I don't see.
*  What he's saying makes sense though.
*  If that cat loves him and the cat sees him faint and the cat wants to drag him to safety,
*  just they don't know they can't deal to bite you.
*  You ever see the reunions with these things?
*  The reunions of like the trainers and they haven't seen them in years.
*  Like these zoo guys that raise tigers and set them free and then they reunite them.
*  In the wild they reunite them and these tigers just come charging at the guy, jump up and
*  just start licking him.
*  You see that and I think that's bad press to put out there really, I'll tell you the
*  truth.
*  Why?
*  Because it's making them, it looks like a domesticated house cat.
*  The thing that looks adorable, it's licking it.
*  I'm like maybe I can raise a lion.
*  Yeah, don't do that.
*  That's a good point.
*  But it's like if you raise one from the time it's a baby, it realizes like oh my god that
*  life is so much better than this bullshit life of chasing gazelles.
*  I know right?
*  That life sucks.
*  The guys are, and this guy's like letho-sectional in his house and he's feeding them, he's just
*  throwing them meat and he's like playing DJ Khaled.
*  I'm like how, this guy's going to die.
*  He has like 30 lions free roaming the house.
*  He's got like a billion Instagram followers.
*  Everyone's following, waiting for the post.
*  Tiger scene in Houston neighborhood found after a week of searching and legal wrangling.
*  A week!
*  A week is crazy.
*  Oh my god, that's so crazy to have a tiger rolling around for a week.
*  Just dodging for a week.
*  How is it hiding?
*  How are they so bad at finding tigers?
*  Anyone who lays eyes on that tiger is calling it in.
*  Yeah, but don't you have helicopters and shit?
*  You don't let that go for a week.
*  How do you get that, where's it going?
*  Where'd it go?
*  Nobody gets lunch until they find it.
*  It's like you can't just let it go.
*  It's overtime boys, come on.
*  Every night they were like, alright let's go to bed tomorrow, we'll wake up early.
*  It's not a tiny tiger.
*  So it came right up to people?
*  Is that what it's doing?
*  It says this is an off duty police officer points a weapon as the apparent owner retrieves
*  the tiger that had gotten out.
*  Oh my god, so this dude can just grab it.
*  It's kind of cool though that they just let the guy grab his tiger instead of shooting
*  it until they find a bunch of dead dogs and cats.
*  You think that that's a small tiger?
*  I went to the Nashville Zoo, I got a backstage tour, they had baby cloud leopards that were
*  just born.
*  I held them in my hand and fed them with a bottle.
*  They were this big, you could have crushed it.
*  A year later I was back there on the road, I went back and they said, do you want to
*  baby cloud leopard you fed?
*  They build these outdoor structures, these cages, so they're living outside but they're
*  in outdoor cages.
*  They bring me in the cage, and we're with a few people and they're like, that's the
*  one that you fed last year.
*  Now it's like, it was this big when I fed them, now it's probably this big.
*  But it's lean, it's lean.
*  This big.
*  Bigger than any house cat you've ever seen.
*  You still think it couldn't hurt you, so they tell you, they say whatever you do, just don't
*  turn your back to it.
*  So I was like, okay.
*  And I was like, can this thing hurt me or not?
*  Why are we in here?
*  You know what I mean?
*  And at one point I turned around, we were going to walk out, I turned around, it swiped
*  at me right here.
*  I still have a mark for it.
*  It swiped at me right here and sliced me and drew blood.
*  It wasn't a deep cut or anything.
*  It only did it when you turned your back.
*  When I turned, I was like, oh my, it fucking did it.
*  And it's just one line right here.
*  It wasn't like, I didn't need medical attention.
*  I'm God, but it got me and it broke skin.
*  Deep predatory instincts.
*  Just turning around.
*  And I was like, I fed you as you.
*  Yeah, it's something that's not looking.
*  Anything that's not looking, it's going to get it.
*  Isn't that scary?
*  It's like built into its hard drive.
*  Dude, can't do it.
*  They got a face ripped off by the chimp.
*  Oh, just reading about that.
*  Oh my God.
*  They have a picture, I think of it.
*  And don't do it.
*  Yeah, don't do it.
*  Yeah, that's a terrible story, man.
*  That's horrific.
*  I think they have audio of it or something,
*  where she's just like...
*  This 911 audio.
*  Oh God.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, those chimps, they dismember you.
*  He ripped her entire face off.
*  Yeah, they try to ruin you.
*  They try to bite your fingers off.
*  They go for your genitals.
*  Yeah.
*  They tear your feet off.
*  That's an odd handbook for them.
*  Let me tear his feet off first.
*  They want to cripple you.
*  Yeah.
*  They're not even trying to kill you.
*  They're trying to cripple you.
*  Is that what they're doing?
*  Yeah, they're smart.
*  Cripple you and then what?
*  Evil and smart.
*  They're trying to ruin you.
*  They can't do no more fingers, bitch.
*  Just cripple you and walk away and be like,
*  now live like that?
*  Yeah, they just want to hurt you.
*  They don't have any morals.
*  They're just these wild, intelligent things.
*  Why do they have a break point then?
*  Why do they want to just kill you?
*  I don't know why they do that to people,
*  but if they wanted to kill you, they could kill you really quick.
*  They can just bash your head against the ground,
*  you'd be dead in a second.
*  But I don't think they want to kill you.
*  I think they want to fucking hurt you.
*  They punish you.
*  They have like, one of the more horrible stories
*  was this guy had a chimp that he raised for a while
*  and then it got big and it became a bit of a problem
*  and he had to give it to a rescue center.
*  And he would go back with his wife and they would visit the chimp.
*  And one time he went back and he brought the chimp a cake
*  because it was his birthday.
*  And the other chimps were so angry that they didn't get cake.
*  You got to be fucking kidding me.
*  And someone fucked up and left one of the doors open
*  and the chimps got out.
*  They figured out a way to get out.
*  They opened the door, attacked the guy and just tore him apart.
*  Tore his hands off, tore his face off.
*  The guy who raised...
*  Uh-huh.
*  It wasn't him.
*  It wasn't the chimp he raised that did that.
*  It was the other chimps.
*  So the other chimps were jealous that they didn't bring them,
*  that he didn't bring them cakes to.
*  You don't have to bring cake for everybody.
*  They're evil.
*  They can be evil.
*  They don't care.
*  It's not a proportionate response to something.
*  No, I think that's...
*  They overreact.
*  A little bit.
*  But they're intelligent, but they're also ruthless
*  in this crazy way that is incomprehensible.
*  The worst possible characteristics you could ever imagine
*  happening in human beings are just common.
*  Just common with chimps.
*  Commonplace.
*  Man, that's another thing, explaining these deaths.
*  Like to his family down the line, he brought an angel food cake to...
*  He didn't even kill him.
*  Just tore him apart.
*  He didn't kill him?
*  No, he survived.
*  And then does he have a life after that?
*  Or what is...
*  How much?
*  His face is gone.
*  His hands are gone.
*  Different bodies all fucked up.
*  They just tear you apart.
*  They go for your dick.
*  I wonder how he feels about cake now, the guy.
*  He probably doesn't...
*  Maybe I should have brought four cakes.
*  He's probably a cookie guy only now.
*  I wouldn't look at cakes.
*  Too traumatic.
*  He even has the eyeballs.
*  And it's not like...
*  I saw a chimp bite somebody.
*  When I was little...
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  When I was little, we went to...
*  You familiar with New York, upstate, like...
*  What do they call it?
*  Lake George and stuff like that?
*  Sure, I know what that is.
*  We'd go up there and we'd...
*  Or even the poke...
*  The Catskills.
*  Beautiful.
*  Yeah.
*  And I remember we were at this little resort or whatever and they had entertainment.
*  And they had a daily show and it happened every day.
*  And we were there for a few days so I would go to the show every day.
*  It was in this little cabaret theater.
*  And this guy would come out, a cowboy in all-sequence outfit, and he hosted the show.
*  It was full of kids.
*  And there was all different acts and he would bring them out.
*  So he brings out...
*  One of the acts he brings out, the stage becomes a little ice skating rink.
*  The ice skating rink, I'd say, is maybe twice the size of this table.
*  It's just for them to do little twirls.
*  And the guy comes out and he has a chimp dressed as a cowboy in ice skates.
*  And he's dressed as a cowboy in ice skates.
*  And they start skating together and he's holding the chimp and they're twirling and twirling
*  and everything.
*  And then the chimp loses control, flies...
*  He lets go of the chimp, the chimp flies off the stage and the woman at a little cocktail
*  table in the front...
*  He landed on her and bit her right here as he landed.
*  Bitter right here.
*  And she was bleeding everywhere.
*  She started screaming.
*  She's like, it bit me, it bit me.
*  And she's screaming.
*  And the guy didn't know what to do.
*  And he got the chimp and they got back onto the ice.
*  And he was like, okay...
*  He took a chunk, you saw a chunk of flesh out.
*  I was like eight.
*  And I was like, I couldn't believe...
*  And there was no one really there.
*  There was like 15 people.
*  The place was empty.
*  It was like a weekday chimp ice skating show.
*  No one wanted to see it.
*  It was like at lunch.
*  And it was all dark in there.
*  Like it was all moody and everything.
*  Oh my god.
*  It was a surreal experience.
*  And this guy just was like, all right, that's going to be the show for today.
*  And the next day they did the show with the chimp.
*  The next day they did the show with the chimp.
*  With the same girl?
*  No, no, the woman was a patron.
*  A patron?
*  Yes.
*  I don't know what happened.
*  Could you sue back then?
*  Were those the suing days?
*  I mean...
*  Anything about it?
*  I mean, I was eight.
*  I kept my head to the streets, but nothing came over my desk.
*  I mean, I had to imagine it was some type of lawsuit.
*  I can't believe though that like the...
*  The chimp didn't get put down.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, maybe it did.
*  Maybe it did.
*  I don't know.
*  It was wild though.
*  They started to clamp down on that.
*  They're trying to pass laws in places.
*  Ice skating chimp?
*  You can't have chimps.
*  Ice skate?
*  Or just regular?
*  Can't have regular ones.
*  Because like this lady in Connecticut just said, like it was legal what she was doing.
*  I think they've changed those laws though.
*  You shouldn't be able to have them.
*  We can't wear shoes on a plane because one time, one time, one guy failed at doing something
*  with his shoes.
*  Right.
*  This lady gets her face ripped off to the skull, still can have chimpanzees.
*  Still climbing.
*  Not a big deal.
*  I don't know if you can anymore.
*  After her?
*  Yeah.
*  I think they changed...
*  Oh, she was the woman that did it?
*  I think...
*  Well, there was those two different stories that were both in the news around the same
*  time and one of them was the guy that brought the birthday cake to the chimps and the other
*  one was this lady whose friend was visiting her and just got the chimp tore apart her
*  friend.
*  That was a bad time for chimps.
*  Okay.
*  Under CT, is this Connecticut?
*  It's illegal to import and possess all primates in the family hominade gorillas, chimpanzees,
*  bonobos and orangutans.
*  Zoos that are accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums or the Zoological Association
*  of America are exempt from the ban.
*  So they passed a ban after she got tore up.
*  But that's just Connecticut.
*  But there's places you could have them.
*  A general tea you could have them right here.
*  A general tea.
*  You see people with crocs?
*  Look at this.
*  People have crocs in their apartments.
*  There's people in fucking New York City.
*  In New York City, there's a guy that had a tiger in his house, in his apartment.
*  The cops are like...
*  There's a very famous photo of the cops going up the fire escape and you look in the window,
*  and you see a fucking cat.
*  I mean a big tiger dude.
*  It's just like this, like bearing its teeth.
*  It's the nuttiest picture.
*  Yeah.
*  What is he supposed to do?
*  Shoot it with a dart or something, right?
*  I think you have to shoot it, shoot it.
*  I don't think a dart...
*  You're not...
*  I mean, I don't know what they did.
*  I don't know how they did it.
*  Well, good Lord.
*  Who's going to be close enough to a cat in an apartment to shoot it with a dart?
*  Are you fucking sure you're going to hit it?
*  Yeah.
*  I'm not going in there.
*  You only get one shot.
*  How many darts?
*  What are you talking about?
*  You're going to go in the apartment and shoot it with a dart?
*  Are you out of your fucking mind?
*  And he's the guy that gets the call.
*  He's going up the fire escape with a dart in his hand.
*  He's just like dogs.
*  Yeah.
*  A dog?
*  Yeah, I'll shoot a dog with a dart.
*  I'm surprised that tiger just doesn't live there until it dies because who's extracting
*  that thing?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, what if it gets out?
*  What if it figures out that windows are like...
*  You just go right through them.
*  What about in Florida?
*  Fire escape.
*  People, the kids and dogs and everything get by fucking crocs and alligators every single
*  day.
*  Not every day.
*  Joe, it's every day, Joe.
*  They don't have very many crocodiles.
*  More than I think should happen.
*  People have their houses blocked off so the crocs can't get in there.
*  Yeah, it's alligators mostly.
*  Oh, alligators.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a difference.
*  Crocodiles are way more dangerous.
*  Oh, is that right?
*  They're way more aggressive.
*  But did they cohabitate?
*  They do in the Everglades apparently now.
*  Not a lot, but they have had more than one sighting of Nile crocodiles in the Everglades.
*  And some of the biologists have speculation that there might be a breeding population.
*  Because there's so many assholes who just release things in the Everglades.
*  I mean, you know the python situation there, right?
*  No.
*  You haven't seen them yet?
*  No.
*  Nothing?
*  No.
*  They're giant pythons that are all invasive.
*  They're all pets.
*  Or from research.
*  Are you serious?
*  Yeah, so they're either from a research place where people were working.
*  Some of them definitely got released there.
*  But other ones are released just because they're people's pets.
*  So assholes, some fucking dude is in the death metal, has a python.
*  It's like, you know, I can't feed you right now, but I'm gonna let you go and in two years
*  after my album hits I'll be back.
*  Remember me.
*  He lets this fucking monster loose in the swamps and it just, they've decimated the
*  swamps.
*  So the Everglades is missing like 90% of all of its mammals.
*  Shit.
*  Everything.
*  They're eating alligators now.
*  The pythons are eating alligators.
*  There's this crazy photograph.
*  A python can eat, I guess, yeah.
*  Well, they died doing it.
*  Because the alligator like worked its way partially out of the python's body with its
*  tail.
*  It's like, that's the most fucked up photo.
*  They threw me in the swamps in the bayou in New Orleans where alligators were for the
*  show.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Yeah, man.
*  Why?
*  You could die, man.
*  These are like real you could die thing.
*  I know.
*  They dressed me as a bog, a ghillie suit, as like a bog monster.
*  And they put me in the swamp and I had to hide behind this thing.
*  I mean, dude, the swamp swamp, not like what I was, we took a fan boat.
*  The water looked like chocolate milk.
*  If you put your hand under the water.
*  That's so dangerous.
*  I know.
*  If you put your hand under the water this low, you couldn't see your hand.
*  It's about 110 degrees that day.
*  They put me in this ghillie suit.
*  I was nervous about germs anyway, so I actually literally wore a condom to go in there because
*  I was afraid of stuff going up my peat hole.
*  Like a parasite.
*  Oh, right.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I was just like, I don't know if it was going to help, but I was like, why not?
*  Right.
*  You know, like wearing a mask.
*  Yeah.
*  I just was like, I'm just going to put it on my soft dick.
*  I mean, I just try, you know, anything that can help me really.
*  Because I wasn't allowed to say no.
*  You can't say no to these things.
*  That's the whole point of the show.
*  When you lose, you can't say no to whatever's coming your way.
*  So there was a fan boat tour that passed the route and they wanted me to come out during
*  the fan boat tour so the guy could be like, oh, the, you know, the lore of the Bog Monster.
*  Just fuck it with me.
*  Not to scare the people, to make me look like a moron.
*  And yeah, do they know for sure?
*  Okay, this is fine.
*  No.
*  So they didn't tell me that that was happening.
*  But so that's my friend just attacking me.
*  But so they, I had to hide behind that area over this week, just getting into it.
*  Yeah, dude, what I would worry about doing this in Louisiana is someone who's got a gun
*  and is like, I'm finally kill me a big foot.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, well, there's people that are not smart.
*  Yeah.
*  And they are armed.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I didn't think of that.
*  I was worried about them more than there would be the alligators.
*  Yeah.
*  Scaring regular white people.
*  In that moment, though, I actually, I was so got so nauseous because it was 105 degrees
*  to smell and I didn't want to be, I threw up and I couldn't leave the, where I had to
*  stay for the bit.
*  So I was just standing up, sitting like in my own throw up.
*  Oh God.
*  Yeah.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Like about 15 minutes in, they go, oh, South South, get back.
*  And they point and there's an alligator and it's coming at me.
*  And I think it's even okay.
*  And I go, ah, and I turn and I run toward the boat screaming.
*  And there was a remote control alligator that they got that I didn't even know existed,
*  but it was an alligator.
*  And for a good 10 seconds, my reality was that an alligator was coming at me.
*  That would be the end of your show.
*  I wasn't mobile.
*  Look at the outfit I was in.
*  I didn't really move.
*  That would be the end of the show.
*  The end of me.
*  Yeah.
*  And then the end of the show.
*  But you were thinking about the show, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I was like, I cannot, what about all the basic cable fans?
*  What about all the people that work behind the scenes?
*  The real heroes.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Don't do those things, dude.
*  Don't fuck around with nature.
*  If you want to do silly things with humans, that's great.
*  But you start getting in the swamps, dude.
*  They're few and far between.
*  It sounds like we do a lot, but they're few and far between.
*  Imagine about Python just clamped a hole in your leg and started wrapping around your
*  body and you realize you're trapped.
*  You're trapped in this stupid fucking swamp where you can't see anything.
*  You don't know how to get out.
*  And this snake's trying to kill you.
*  You don't even have a weapon.
*  You have nothing to fight it off.
*  I hope I go by surprise.
*  That wouldn't be much of a surprise.
*  The beginning would be a surprise.
*  I don't want to go in that way.
*  I don't want to know that imminent, this death eminent in the next one minute to hour, whatever
*  the fuck it is.
*  When a Python wraps around you, I'd imagine it takes a little while.
*  I bet the fear of it taking a while, it constricting you is probably fucking just numbing.
*  You probably can't think.
*  You're probably so overwhelmed with fear.
*  This thing's constricting your body and literally breaking your bones.
*  It's like crushing you.
*  I'm so scared of death already.
*  And I think of death all the time and never have I thought of it in the light that we've
*  been talking about tonight.
*  So we just added a whole nice new bucket for me.
*  Yeah, animals are things you really need to worry about.
*  My friend Paul Rosalie, he lives in the Amazon.
*  And he got on top of an anaconda that was so big he couldn't get his arms around it.
*  Yeah.
*  Why?
*  He was seeing this thing slither through the water and it was kind of dark out.
*  And you'd have to go listen to the clip on YouTube to get the exact wording of how he
*  said it.
*  He essentially wanted to try to hold on to it because it wasn't going to try to come
*  back.
*  He took a chance that it wouldn't attack him.
*  So he just why?
*  I don't know.
*  He's just fucking insane.
*  Everybody thought he was insane.
*  One that big?
*  Dude.
*  Like why?
*  I don't understand.
*  It's so big that he couldn't get his arms around it.
*  Is that what he does?
*  He's basically like my size, maybe a little bigger than me.
*  He couldn't get his arms around it.
*  Does he work with?
*  Well, he works with the rainforest.
*  He works in the rain.
*  Cafe?
*  No, no, no.
*  His whole thing is saving rainforest land.
*  What they do is they take these people that were hired as loggers and they pay them more
*  money to protect the rainforest because it's basically just poor people.
*  And doing that, they've saved like millions of acres of rainforest.
*  So he actually lives out there.
*  So he sees these things and he said this is the biggest one he's ever seen.
*  They don't even know really how big the biggest one is.
*  It's just like the limited number that they've measured and come in contact with.
*  Right.
*  End game.
*  He just wanted to like experience it, I think, like just grab a hold of it.
*  He didn't think it would bite him.
*  I don't remember him talking about this.
*  He tried to get eaten by a snake at one point about 10 years ago.
*  He tried to?
*  They tried to.
*  They filmed it for a show.
*  They tried to.
*  He tried to get eaten by the biggest anaconda they could find.
*  What were they going to do?
*  They were going to kill it when did he have like some quite a crazy suit on?
*  Yeah, he had this suit on here.
*  That are preventing him from dying?
*  What the fuck is he doing?
*  It's carbon fire.
*  Oh God.
*  That's so ridiculous.
*  Yeah, I don't know how I got me.
*  Look, it's got its head around him.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Wait, what?
*  Yeah.
*  That's hilarious.
*  So that so so that dumb idea of all.
*  So that suit is preventing the strength of that snake from that's how did you see?
*  Jamie, see if you could find that video of the largest anaconda ever discovered.
*  These guys are swimming under the water with it in this river.
*  It's insane.
*  It's insane.
*  These guys are swimming down there in the water and this thing's moving along the bottom
*  of the water and its head is like this big.
*  It's like a crocodile or something.
*  So big.
*  Its head is like way bigger than you think a snake's head should be like bigger than
*  a human head.
*  Underwater is scarier to me than the forest even underwater.
*  It's another planet.
*  It's aliens.
*  They're aliens.
*  They are aliens and there's no doors, no doors.
*  You never lock yourself in a room like whoo.
*  Yeah.
*  Finally I'm home.
*  Nobody gets to relax.
*  Wow, it's unobstructed.
*  Yeah, there's no doors.
*  Yeah.
*  Look at this thing, dude.
*  Look at this thing.
*  It's 26 feet long.
*  Look at these guys swimming by it.
*  And what is that eating?
*  Everything.
*  To sustain that size, to sustain that size, what is that thing eating?
*  Everything.
*  Look at its head.
*  He goes right to it.
*  Look at the fucking head.
*  He's got on a Fisher Price goggle set from CVS.
*  What is he doing?
*  He's being a dork.
*  Look at his outfit.
*  He's got his watch on.
*  He's got a long sleeve.
*  Yeah, he might be one of them influencers.
*  But whoever this fella is, or maybe he's just a scientist that's a young kid, but whoever
*  this fella is, like, you got balls.
*  Just assume that thing doesn't want to just eat you.
*  But it's not even balls though.
*  It's like, it is balls.
*  His name is Dr. Freak.
*  So you still don't know if he's a doctor or an influencer then?
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  Freak-vonk?
*  Is that what it said?
*  Dr. Freak dies fucking with a bullet.
*  I can see it.
*  Dr. Freak.
*  He sounds like he should be like one of them DJs at an EDM show.
*  Yeah, Dr. Freak's here.
*  With Marshmallow.
*  The best name you've heard.
*  Dr. Freak.
*  The best name I've heard for anybody.
*  Yeah, solid name.
*  Just a great fucking name.
*  For like what?
*  For a human?
*  As a human name.
*  Yeah, like just as someone's first and last name.
*  I never even thought about that.
*  Nothing comes to mind.
*  Yeah.
*  What about you?
*  Someone just said to me a couple days ago, and I was like, that is the fucking coolest
*  name I've ever heard.
*  But I don't fucking remember it.
*  It was something like Enrico Palazzo.
*  It was something like a good, flairful name.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  If you have a flairful name and you're a fucking loser, that's got to suck.
*  Yeah, that's gotta suck.
*  You know?
*  If you've got some beautiful name and you turn out to be a loser.
*  Yeah.
*  He's a Dutch wildlife presenter.
*  So he's like...
*  Oh, so he's a presenter, but is he also a doctor?
*  Wait, that was...
*  I don't want to call him Dr. Freak if he's not really a doctor.
*  That's a real bad thing?
*  That's real?
*  Yeah.
*  That's a bear with wings right there?
*  That thing?
*  That's a good thing if you've got to look where his feet are.
*  He's standing behind it.
*  The bat's in front of the camera.
*  Still?
*  No, it's not as big as it looks.
*  Still?
*  Yeah.
*  Still?
*  I mean, it's probably kind of big.
*  He's not that far behind us.
*  He's far enough.
*  Yeah, but if he got right up to it, it would be about that big.
*  No.
*  The rat body.
*  The body part.
*  I don't know.
*  I think he got close to it.
*  Which kind is it?
*  By the way, how do those things exist and we don't talk about them or see them?
*  Well, wing length is five feet.
*  Wing length is five feet.
*  Okay.
*  It's like foxes.
*  Fox size, I think.
*  Oh, fuck that.
*  Oh, really?
*  Like fox sized?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, guy.
*  Look at this lady.
*  Oh my god, dude.
*  That's a lot bigger.
*  That one's fucking, that's crazy.
*  Oh my god, look at that.
*  That's the thing with nightmares.
*  That's like Bram Stoker's Dracula where Gary Oldman turns into one of those.
*  That's what it looks like.
*  Who's even going near those things?
*  What are they?
*  They're in Bali.
*  There's a large, I guess, fruit bats.
*  We're so lucky they just like fruit.
*  Oh my god, yeah.
*  So like sort of the same way cows feel about vegans, like whew.
*  So happy.
*  You ever go over here to see bats?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Is it really 1.5 million?
*  I didn't count.
*  No, that's the stat they give you.
*  Yeah, that's the stat.
*  I don't know, but it's an insane amount of bats.
*  It's a sight to see.
*  Oh yeah, it's crazy.
*  I've seen it from a distance, but I've never gone and stood there.
*  It's a cloud of bats.
*  You get shit on?
*  Well, you probably would if you were under them.
*  Like where it is is like where the bridge meets the water.
*  So I imagine when they're flying out, they shit on the water.
*  You know, there was a couple of doctors died because they were standing in front of this
*  cave in Africa where bats, it's like fucking millions and millions of bats in this cave.
*  And every night they would come out and they wanted to get photographs of these bats coming
*  out of the cave.
*  So they're sitting there waiting, the bats come out of the cave and just drench them
*  in shit.
*  Millions and millions of bats just shitting in their face.
*  And they didn't think of that.
*  And they got some crazy hemorrhagic virus and they were both dead in like a matter of
*  days.
*  Again, I'm just taking it to the orbit for that.
*  Or like, you know, you tell them like the great grandfathers like you, great grandfather
*  got shit on by too many bats at one time.
*  And it just went south from that.
*  He was a bat scientist that didn't think about this one thing.
*  Like what you know, how do you not know that's about to happen?
*  Or maybe they just didn't think it would be the volume it would be.
*  See if you can find that case.
*  I'm already looking at it.
*  I found it.
*  It sounds different.
*  How did it come to be down here?
*  How did it?
*  Why is that?
*  Why are they all here?
*  Good question.
*  I don't know.
*  But apparently they eat the mosquitoes.
*  There's more in Houston.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah.
*  That's a migration and a mixture of two different colonies from like they fly from Mexico.
*  They're so cool when they come out at night and you hear them.
*  Yeah, that's how they make you see them fucking flying over like, oh, look at them all.
*  They're cool.
*  And they apparently do just fuck those mosquitoes up.
*  Imagine the bats weren't around.
*  We had like way more mosquitoes because apparently they do.
*  Yeah.
*  You guys don't have a mosquito problem down here that I'm assuming we do.
*  We doubt we have.
*  No, I wouldn't say it's a mosquito problem.
*  Like Alaska has a mosquito problem.
*  Yeah.
*  So you're not going to be in Anchorage in July?
*  No.
*  Bro, you get out of your fucking car.
*  I went but it was August 1st.
*  You get out of your car, it's like a scene from The Birds, like the Alfred Hitchcock
*  movie or Albert Hitchcock.
*  Yeah.
*  No?
*  I went to Australia and the desert and stuff and they had to wear nets because the bugs
*  just land on you and just stay there.
*  Is it Alfred Hitchcock or Albert Hitchcock?
*  Alfred.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  If you get that wrong, your brain goes, wait, which one's the right one?
*  Yeah.
*  Those words, you don't hear Alfred or Albert anymore.
*  Kids, these days.
*  No.
*  There's so many names you don't hear.
*  You do not get called Alfred.
*  Alfred's dead.
*  Yeah.
*  Dead names.
*  Alfred.
*  I've never heard that name.
*  I think Alfred is probably more-
*  It's a beautiful name.
*  It is and I think it's probably more Alfreds than other names though.
*  Adolf's gone.
*  Yeah, Adolf's gone.
*  That's a wrap.
*  Yeah, just a few people here and there.
*  You can't name a good Adolf.
*  You can name your kid Genghis.
*  Nobody would fucking flinch.
*  Yeah, right.
*  That dude killed 10% of the population for her.
*  I know, everybody's like, wow, what a cool name.
*  Is this spiritual?
*  Do you feel connected to the Mongols?
*  Everybody would be cool with that name.
*  Is this like, as in Khan?
*  You could call him Temujin, which is Genghis Khan's real name.
*  Was it really?
*  Yeah, that was his real name.
*  Genghis Khan was a stage name?
*  No, it was like-
*  He was a Khan.
*  He was a Khan.
*  Khan is the ruler.
*  I think, I don't know what it means.
*  What does Genghis mean?
*  It's crazy.
*  I think it's something about who he is as a ruler.
*  But his name, he was born, his name that he was given at birth was Temujin.
*  And he became a Khan.
*  So you could call your kid Temujin, and you'd be naming your kid after someone who killed
*  10% of the population of Earth while he was alive.
*  You think Genghis ever thought his ancestors would own the Jacksonville Jaguars?
*  It says Temujin formally adopted the title Genghis Khan, the meaning of which is uncertain.
*  At an assembly in 1206, carrying out reforms designed to ensure long-term stability, he
*  then transformed the Mongols' tribe structure into an integrated meritocracy dedicated to
*  the service of the ruling family.
*  After thwarting a coup attempt from a powerful shaman, oh, what a wild time to be alive.
*  Warlords and shamans are trying to get a coup on you.
*  Genghis began to consolidate his power.
*  In 1209, he led a large-scale raid into the neighboring western Z who agreed to Mongol
*  terms the following year.
*  Yeah, he did a lot of wild shit.
*  We could go on and on for that.
*  He killed a lot of fucking humans, man.
*  Dan Carlin probably had the answer in his podcast about that, probably, right?
*  This is just from the Wikipedia.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, Dan Carlin's podcast is the best source of that.
*  If you want to know a cool story that's entertaining that you could follow along with, it's the
*  wrath of the Khan.
*  The wrath of the Khan.
*  It's all about that duo.
*  I was lying.
*  But my point is you could name your kid Temujin.
*  Nobody would freak out.
*  Name your kid Adolf and he can't hang out with my kids.
*  Yeah, right.
*  You can't bring Adolf over the house.
*  He's four.
*  He doesn't know.
*  That's the number one name, right?
*  But what's number two?
*  Adolf is a layup, right?
*  And there's no Adolf.
*  Everyone knows no Adolf.
*  Right.
*  Is there even a two?
*  Is he alone on his own?
*  I think he's alone on his own.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Because like Joseph Stalin existed before I was born.
*  I'm Joseph Rogan.
*  Like nobody flinched on Joseph.
*  Yeah.
*  Such a piece of shit.
*  But yet you can still say it.
*  Osama bin Laden.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Well, the rest of these are not real.
*  Yeah.
*  Osama would be a hard one.
*  Yeah, that's a hard one.
*  Hussein would be a hard one.
*  Illegal baby names in the United States?
*  Illegal?
*  What?
*  What?
*  Jesus Christ?
*  You can't name your kid Jesus Christ?
*  You can't name your kid King?
*  You're kidding me.
*  You're kidding me right now.
*  You can't name your kid against the law.
*  You can't name your kid Santa Claus.
*  You can't name him the Atzimov.
*  Bro, you can't name your kid Magistri.
*  It says they were ruled illegal, but I don't know.
*  You can't name your kid Magistri?
*  Why not?
*  Why can't you name it 1069?
*  Wait a minute.
*  You can't name your kid Messiah, but you can name him Muhammad?
*  Right.
*  Help me out.
*  No, it doesn't make any sense.
*  Help me out, because a lot of kids are named Muhammad.
*  Yeah, yeah, of course.
*  Yeah, but why 1069?
*  What the hell is that?
*  Robocops illegal in Mexico?
*  Robocops illegal in Mexico?
*  No, no, no, my friend.
*  No, my friend.
*  No.
*  We draw the line, my friend.
*  You know what's funny?
*  It's not like they're getting caught in the hospital, so it has to get words.
*  They're knocking at the door one day, it's the police.
*  They're like, we've got to rename your son right now.
*  Señor Robocop.
*  This is from the US birth certificates.com.
*  Robocop Martinez.
*  Oh my God.
*  Oh my God.
*  The N-word's on there.
*  Yeah, there's a lot of them.
*  There's a lot of illegal names.
*  I didn't know.
*  I didn't know you couldn't name your kid Jesus Christ, but I know a dude named Jesus.
*  Sure.
*  This is Jesus.
*  I mean, it's just...
*  Right.
*  But you're allowed to be...
*  What if your last name is Christ and you want to name your kid Jesus?
*  I mean, there's some Christs out there.
*  Some dudes, their last name is Christ.
*  What are they supposed to do?
*  They're limited?
*  I can't name my son Jesus?
*  Yeah, right.
*  You can't do that.
*  How come you can name your son Muhammad?
*  How come you can't name your son Jesus?
*  Yeah.
*  Think about how many Muhammad's there were.
*  Think about if it was like...
*  The most popular name in the world.
*  If it was in vogue to name your kid Jesus.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Just millions of Jesus's.
*  So many Jesus's.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Because if you think about how many Muhammad's there are, why are there not an equal number
*  of Jesus's?
*  Right.
*  Because we don't allow it.
*  It's a weakness in our religion.
*  That would become meta.
*  Because then Jesus would be really omnipresent.
*  Yeah.
*  The Christians should get together and say, guys, it's a weakness in our religion.
*  We've got to let people name themselves Jesus.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's...
*  Encourage it.
*  I'm going to change my name to Jesus.
*  It's a walking billboard.
*  Jesus Robinson.
*  Jesus.
*  Yeah.
*  Everybody just comes Jesus and then whatever your last name is.
*  You know, I knew a Jesus and as I'm thinking of this, I was able to compartmentalize it.
*  I didn't think of Jesus every time I called him Jesus.
*  Was he actually Jesus?
*  He was called Jesus, not Jesus?
*  Jesus.
*  We called him Jesus, yeah.
*  But was he Mexican?
*  He was of some Hispanic descent.
*  I don't know what.
*  Did his mom call him Jesus?
*  He was my nephew's friend.
*  Oh.
*  I didn't know him like...
*  But everybody called him...
*  Did they call him Jesus because they couldn't say Jesus or was his name actually Jesus?
*  I think his name was Jesus.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, what about Jesus the comic?
*  There's a dude that...
*  Trey O, right?
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  No, that's Jesus.
*  I call him Jesus.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  But he's Mexican.
*  They don't say it that way.
*  They don't say it that way, yeah.
*  It's a different thing.
*  But how do they say Jesus, though, in Spanish?
*  Isn't it Jesus Christe?
*  It is, but we...
*  So it's Jesus.
*  Everybody called the guy Jesus.
*  Ain't that wild?
*  Stop for a second.
*  So if you're Spanish of Latin descent, it is really popular to name your kid Jesus.
*  Because Jesus is a super common name.
*  That's what it is.
*  It's stuck up white people in America, won't name their kid Jesus.
*  It just takes a courageous person right now listening to our voice, just a courageous person out there to name your kid Jesus.
*  If you name him Jesus, that second name, that last name has to be...
*  Yeah.
*  It's got to go with it.
*  I think a lot of things won't go with Jesus.
*  You know what goes best with it?
*  Fucking.
*  Jesus.
*  Jesus fucking Robinson.
*  Can you do that?
*  Can you name your middle name fucking?
*  That'd be so great.
*  I don't know if you can, but I think you can legally change your name more likely than you can be naming a baby that way.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  Because you name a baby...
*  You rude asshole.
*  You're going to name your kid this little beautiful, innocent baby.
*  You're going to name him Jesus fucking Robinson.
*  No, you'd have to...
*  But if you were an adult, you're like, look, I'm 38 years old.
*  Things are not getting any better.
*  This is life for me.
*  I want to be Jesus fucking Robinson.
*  Yeah.
*  I want to be legally.
*  Yeah.
*  So at the very least, I pull my ID out.
*  What's your name?
*  Jesus fucking Robinson.
*  That's so good.
*  It's a good name.
*  It says it on the wallet.
*  It's a good name.
*  Solid name.
*  Especially if you can do something real good.
*  It's like that's your actual real birth name and you're really good at like fucking fixing
*  cars.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what I mean?
*  You're going to get your car fixed by Jesus fucking Robinson.
*  I was almost a Steve.
*  My mom told me I was almost a Steve.
*  My dad's Sal, so thankfully I got his name.
*  That's a better name for an Italian.
*  Steve is...
*  I'm half.
*  Yeah, but you look Italian.
*  Yeah.
*  I actually just did 23andMe, like all the extended package genetic thing.
*  I just got my results back a couple days ago.
*  Pretty crazy.
*  Do you ever do it?
*  Yeah, I've done it.
*  Did you like what you gleaned from it?
*  Was it interesting?
*  It was pretty much what I thought.
*  It was.
*  Yeah.
*  Somewhere in the neighborhood of three quarters Italian and one quarter Irish.
*  There's like percentages less because there's like 1.6% African, 1% Asian, and it seems
*  to be mostly just Italian though.
*  Yeah, it all goes back to the same...
*  They were able to connect me to...
*  It said in there, there's like about like 100...
*  For the woman, it was 150,000 years.
*  For the male, it was 275,000 years.
*  They said if you trace everyone back, it'll go to one person because even though there
*  were a few thousand, a lot of that DNA net lineage died off.
*  There was this one that just ended up getting through.
*  I literally just read it today.
*  I took a picture of it on my phone actually.
*  Just the unlikelihood of you making it to 2024.
*  Your genes, if you were a person that lived 50,000 years ago, your kid had a kid and kept
*  going.
*  No, they had a kid, someone had a kid, kids, kids, kids, kids, kids.
*  Here we are, 50,000 years later, your genes are still popping.
*  It's insane.
*  It's just wild to me.
*  So, the first man to carry likely lived, this gene that I have, likely lived in southwestern
*  Asia or the Caucasus between 46,000 and 54,000 years ago.
*  His male line descendants appeared to remain rooted in the region for tens of thousands
*  of years while the Ice Age was in full swing.
*  Then around 11,500 years ago, the Ice Age finally gave way to the warmer climate, blah,
*  blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  But, hold on, this is the guy.
*  The human species was confined to a relatively small range in eastern and southern Africa.
*  Over time, members of this gene pool migrated.
*  There was one that said you could trace it right.
*  If every person living today could trace his or her maternal line back over thousands of
*  generations, all of our lines would meet at a single woman who lived in eastern Africa
*  between 150,000, 200,000 years ago.
*  Though she was one of perhaps thousands of women alive at the time, only the diverse
*  branches of her DNA have survived to today.
*  The story of your maternal line begins with her.
*  And for the guys, it's 275,000 years ago.
*  Current evidence suggests he was one of thousands of men who lived in eastern Africa.
*  However, while his male line descendants passed down their Y chromosome generation after
*  generation, the lineages from the other men died out.
*  After time, he was the lone guy.
*  And they told me I'm related to this dude.
*  You ready?
*  Literally a known guy, O.T. the Iceman.
*  No way!
*  I swear to God, let me read this.
*  Dude, I've seen that story a hundred times.
*  Have you?
*  That story's crazy.
*  This is what it says about this dude.
*  Hold on.
*  It says, O.T. the Iceman was discovered in 1991 protruding from a snowbank high.
*  Look at Jamie to show some pictures of it.
*  We've shown it before.
*  Oh, you have.
*  I know the exact story.
*  So, that's it right there.
*  Look how dope it looks.
*  They found him as the glacier melted.
*  That's my...
*  He had an arrowhead stuck in him.
*  That's like my uncle.
*  That's nuts, dude.
*  Yeah, he had the arrow in him.
*  You're related to that guy.
*  Holy shit.
*  I mean, isn't that fucking wild?
*  I mean, probably a lot of people are.
*  He had tattoos.
*  Did he really?
*  Yeah, he had tattoos.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Look at what he looked like.
*  Had the world's oldest tattoos, it said.
*  See if you can go back to that thing that you were reading?
*  Just there?
*  Right below that.
*  Right there.
*  That's it.
*  Had the world's oldest tattoos.
*  How were they made?
*  The oldest tattoos that we know about, right?
*  See, he had 61 tattoos.
*  Wow.
*  He had like a tramp stamp?
*  Yeah, he had a tramp stamp.
*  Oh, he had a bunch of lines carved in him.
*  Interesting.
*  Look at that, all those lines.
*  Even back then, they're like tattoos.
*  Yeah, and they're wild.
*  Might have been a part of ancient healing technique.
*  Hmm.
*  That's just guessing, right?
*  It said that he was murdered.
*  Did you see that?
*  Oh, because of the arrow, but it said he...
*  It might have been from someone, or it might have been someone that he knew.
*  Hmm.
*  Chemical analysis of his teeth indicate he came from the Italian side of the Alps.
*  He suffered during the year before his death with whipworm,
*  a stomach parasite that was found in his digestive tract.
*  Yet he was fit enough, ailing with whipworm for a year,
*  to climb 6,500 feet in elevation during the day or two before he met his end
*  in a rocky alpine hollow.
*  Apparently was murdered, struck by a stone arrow point
*  that was found lodged in his left shoulder.
*  The twisted position of his body indicates that the murderer
*  or one of his accomplices pulled the arrow shaft out of his prone body.
*  Wow.
*  Whoever killed him didn't want his valuables
*  because he had a wrought copper axe still with him.
*  Wow, they just wanted to kill him.
*  Hmm.
*  Wow.
*  And you're related to that dude.
*  That dude jizzed in someone.
*  Literally.
*  Yeah.
*  Before he died by an arrow, he jizzed in someone and that made it to 2024.
*  I'm not here if he's not there.
*  No, you're not here.
*  If he didn't get that nut off, that's a fucking one.
*  Yeah.
*  Probably some tattooed up crazy cave lady.
*  Two of them just grunting, smelling like shit.
*  Ah, ah, ah, I mean nuts.
*  She screams, ah, what's up baby?
*  Can we have a fucking baby?
*  And fucking 50,000 years later, I am a show untrue.
*  We're on TBS now actually.
*  It's kind of crazy.
*  It really is kind of crazy if you think about how the timeline of people goes.
*  I mean, we can't imagine living back then.
*  It's just unimaginable.
*  I can't put it in my head.
*  How long ago?
*  What is the exact thousand years ago that guy supposedly lived?
*  That one said 50,000.
*  I mean, who can wrap that?
*  5,300 years ago.
*  Okay.
*  But the first man was 200 and something.
*  The first man was 200 and something.
*  They have DNA from is 275.
*  So he's from 5,000 years ago.
*  Just imagine.
*  5,300.
*  He's a kid.
*  Imagine 5,000 years ago you just get dropped off and you got to just exist.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, like even imagine like language, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Even the primary language is like, it still was secular.
*  Like even if you had to travel somewhere and you had some type of language that you kind
*  of rooted with who you were with, that didn't translate when you came across someone that
*  you didn't know.
*  Yeah.
*  You go to Vietnam.
*  Good luck talking to people.
*  So was it just, I guess, like, you know, was it killing people on sight or did they kind
*  of go by like body language?
*  I think people who traveled had to learn languages for sure.
*  You probably had to have people help you or work with somebody from that.
*  But how many of them can you learn?
*  And if you're living in somewhere in North America and you go to China in like the 1800s,
*  like, how much communication can you do?
*  Did you?
*  Oh, did you see that new that new thing they're working on the A.I. earpiece?
*  It's fucking nuts.
*  Is it Ted talk about it?
*  So this guy, he's like, OK, this is an all new thing that they're doing.
*  It's like he's in a restaurant.
*  He was my friends across the other end.
*  Did you see that?
*  Then he isolates his voice.
*  Yeah.
*  And then he's speaking in Spanish and they do real time, not translation.
*  His voice is reinterpreted in his voice in English as he speaks Spanish in real time.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's hearing this isolated from across the room.
*  Yeah.
*  That's fucked up.
*  It's crazy.
*  I mean, in one respect, you eliminate you literally eliminate every single language
*  barrier across Earth with this technology.
*  Yeah.
*  But in the other, you know, Superman, you can listen to a comment, can isolate a conversation
*  from a, you know, it's I think it can only isolate that conversation if those people
*  have those things on too.
*  But why would anyone wear that?
*  Well, you would have to let someone use it.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Like if you were talking to someone through that on the other side, am I wrong?
*  No, they weren't talking.
*  He was listening to his conversation.
*  He was just listening.
*  I thought it was the people in the room having the conversation.
*  This guy was in the room with the earpiece on.
*  He's looking to clear across the room at two people at a table talking and he's just listening.
*  So he said, I see.
*  Oh, I misunderstood.
*  I thought when I saw the narrating that what they were saying, what he was saying was you
*  could do that if you were those two people, you could isolate the car.
*  Oh, you could just listen to them.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Oh, that's fucking creepy.
*  But he wasn't pitching like this is a Ted Talk.
*  So it's like, I don't know what the technology.
*  Yeah.
*  How far away is he from them?
*  I think he says in the beginning, they were across the room or something.
*  Oh, I guess he's and can you turn that baby down?
*  That's better.
*  I'm still having a little trouble hearing Pedro.
*  Can you isolate Pedro for me?
*  No, he's on stage right now for the Ted Talk.
*  So he's not with them.
*  That's perfect.
*  And you know, my Spanish is a little rusty.
*  Can I hear Pedro but in English?
*  And at the end of the trip, we came back to the city to visit the historic center.
*  That's the same.
*  We shall close all programs.
*  That's the same.
*  What you just let it go.
*  TURD was a beamforming app, the computational auditory scene analysis app, a machine learning
*  denoising app, an AI transcription and translation and text to speech with style transfer app.
*  So these are not just fancy looking earbuds.
*  They're an entire computer.
*  And we think they're going to replace some of what we do with the visual computers that
*  we're used to.
*  Right cuts off right there.
*  Here's the thing, though.
*  What was he watching?
*  Was he watching a video of people talking and then do that?
*  Because that makes more sense.
*  I don't think he's actually eavesdropping on people across the room.
*  I think what he's doing is watching a video of people having a conversation and tuning
*  in to those people and taking a look at the video.
*  And taking all the outside noise out and then translating those people in that video in
*  real time.
*  I think he was he watching a video of those people?
*  I think he's watching a video.
*  OK, which makes more sense.
*  OK, is that right?
*  No, I'm all right.
*  Well, that the problem is, is that they're showing something that probably doesn't work
*  that way.
*  Also, they're bullshitting.
*  A little bit.
*  But when they're showing it, they're watching a video, though.
*  Right.
*  I'm trying to show you what they're doing.
*  Because he's on stage.
*  Yeah, he's on stage.
*  It's not like it just happens to be a cafe in the room where no one's noticing.
*  Correct.
*  But he that's part of why it's just a weird tech demo of showing what they were doing
*  and how much work was set up to do that specific very like did it just translate the sentence
*  they wanted it to translate?
*  And was it all planned in advance?
*  And then they show like they did do a setup here.
*  So I'll let him explain what they did.
*  So.
*  So it's actually impossible to demonstrate this experience until you hear it with your
*  ears yourself.
*  But to give you an idea, we have tried to simulate it for you.
*  Oh, OK.
*  So imagine that you're sitting in a noisy.
*  OK.
*  OK.
*  So it doesn't.
*  So it's going to be able to do that.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's going to be able to do that.
*  If he's doing a TED talk on it and they're getting this far along with it, unless he's
*  like, what's that crazy lady, Elizabeth?
*  What's her name?
*  I just don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  Elizabeth Theranos.
*  Yeah.
*  But was her last name the crazy lady from San Francisco with the blood company?
*  You know, the Theranos.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Blood testing company that just was straight bullshit.
*  It was a whole trial.
*  Elizabeth Holmes.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  She just lost.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, the story behind it is crazy.
*  It's like some people were testing them and they're like, hey, this doesn't work.
*  Like, get out of here.
*  And they're like, OK, I'm going to do this.
*  And they're like, OK, I'm going to do this.
*  And they're like, OK, I'm going to do this.
*  And they're like, OK, I'm going to do this.
*  It was just this wild scam.
*  I have my DNA saved, DNA and sperm.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I got, I had the option.
*  I was like, let me do it.
*  You might as well.
*  You got all the way from the Iceman to today.
*  Be a shame if we lost you.
*  You know, if it died here.
*  That's it.
*  Did you hear about the cryogenic people?
*  You know how they started cryogenicly freezing people a long time ago.
*  Yeah, a lot of them actually thought out.
*  They actually thought out yeah some of them like it didn't work no the one like headline was like yeah
*  They script they were scraping goo off the model
*  Yeah, like if it had the power goes out and you thought out that's a wrap
*  That shit's fascinating isn't it only like one company or something that's doing that imagine if you're in heaven
*  Okay, yeah, and you died you went to heaven. You know like God. I'm free of all my
*  Earthly pulls, and I just feel one connected and all sudden
*  Back to life again, and they're stitching your fucking head on
*  This new body and you're alive now, but you're paralyzed, but with new technology. They can keep you alive forever
*  And what year is it? Congratulations Walt Disney's back
*  Imagine if you were in heaven yeah, but imagine if during the process of reattaching your head it made your mouth paralyzed so you couldn't even talk
*  Hell yeah, tell it's like the fucking movie where they eat each other so to each other's ass
*  Could you imagine if you're you're dead for like a hundred years a hundred years of heaven?
*  This is so much nicer than being alive. Oh my god. Everyone's just there's no arguments
*  It's just love beauty and and it's just the expression of love and geometric patterns
*  And it flows through you and we all bathe in it no one needs to eat no needs to sleep arrives
*  It's just love and also
*  Like a final clear
*  Stitching your fucking head
*  You can't talk is your mouth paralyzed yeah, and they pay for that a
*  Lot of money to probably also think it's more money if you want the whole body the one thing
*  I was like thinking is like let's say let's just say right it works the way one day the way that they thought it would
*  Work, what are you coming back to everybody that didn't do it is dead
*  You know no one you probably are not gonna be able to adjust to the where the society there in now
*  Who knows how people would treat you like what you're really signing up as something like it's like
*  What are you signing up for I think they're signing up for the hope that if they do get reincarnated. It's like space
*  2001 you get reincarnated to this
*  crazy
*  Futuristic world or they could shh welcome back welcome back
*  How was your trip sir you think they're trying to preserve consciousness their consciousness?
*  I don't know what consciousness is really here's the here's the question. I mean I I know I'm conscious
*  I know you can have this conversation. I think therefore I am I know I get it
*  I don't know if consciousness is something the brain tunes into or whether the brain is conscious
*  I know if you damage parts of the brain it damages parts of your consciousness and dam damages
*  Different things that you can do and they're they're they're pretty clear on what parts of the brain are
*  responsible for different things, but
*  I'm not sure that consciousness is something as simple as neurons firing and your brain
*  Interfacing with the world and using all its senses. I have a feeling
*  That we might be short-sighted because we can't and again. This is not scientifically provable
*  So you have to be just speculative about something like this
*  But I have a feeling there's probably quite a few things that we're not
*  Totally in tune with to the point where we can measure them
*  Yeah, and I think consciousness might be one of those things I think and I also think we're
*  We are all weirdly connected in some strange consciousness
*  Web some strange net of human beings. I think we're all connected all of us
*  It's just the further those people are away the less you feel that connection
*  Yeah, but I think we're all oddly connected already before we get to like the cell phones in your head and everybody being telepathic
*  I think we're already oddly connected. We just don't necessarily feel it all the time. Yeah, I hope it's something
*  I mean, I really do you ever think did you have a moment where you think I'm I might die like to
*  Ever come across like did you have that feeling I was a kid when I was like
*  14 mean a few friends were playing around in this
*  Place where they stored these like enormous
*  concrete
*  Like sewer pipes like these big fucking pipes. Yeah, and there was this
*  This giant metal thing that I guess
*  It was a part of like what they were attached to a crane so they can move these things and
*  It slipped and hit me in the head and I didn't go unconscious
*  But I grayed out like grayed out. Yeah, and my head was pouring blood
*  I still have a big ding on the side of my head from it and
*  I went to the hospital and like I thought it was gonna die
*  I did think I was gonna die at that point, but I was also 14
*  So I was probably just freaked out with the fact that I got hit sure
*  You know like that this thing hit my head and it only fell like a certain amount because there was other
*  Concrete things in the way so it banged me in the head and it didn't fall on me luckily
*  But you're like in the hospital like think you had the feeling like I was I got hit so hard
*  It hit me so hard and it was so big. I was like this could be a real problem
*  This could be a real I was like I could be dead right now for sure
*  See you haven't those thoughts are running through your mind. Yeah, I was okay. I went to the hospital. I'm sure I had some sort of a concussion
*  They they treated me. I forget what they did, but then they just let me go home
*  You know and I was just they were like, oh he's okay
*  Because I don't think they understood head trauma back then
*  I don't think people really got it and I don't remember really suffering any like serious consequences of it. I was never like
*  I never had a problem like looking at the light. I never had a problem with loud noises or anything like that. Yeah
*  But it was spooky. That's probably the closest I've ever come to
*  Really worrying about being dead. I had one but it wasn't in that it was in on a plane
*  Yeah, it was bad to this day like if I think about it, I actually will have like a little bit of anxiety attack
*  We were it was a product. It was a small plane. We had to do a show in the middle of nowhere
*  On the road and they offered a plane so we took it and and we were flying back
*  home
*  And it was like a eight-seat plane whatever was and I don't like flying at all
*  Anyway, never mind people like how cool you got to do it. I'm like, yeah, I mean, I don't like it's like you see everything
*  There's no door in the cockpit. You see like all the motion, you know, I mean
*  I mean like I it's just like I this feels unsafe. It's like I'm flying in a toy airplane
*  Any gust of wind though this as normal we just will be kind of glide with it, you know
*  And it's like I don't want to feel like we're up there like surfing
*  you know, I mean and we were going to land and which is bullshit and with the guys my guy my friends and
*  We're talking then the guy right before we land he goes starts to go back up again
*  and I look at them I go what just happened there like why are we going back up and
*  The guy the copilot comes back goes guys
*  We have a little bit of a situation and he goes what he goes
*  So we were about to land just now you might have noticed like yeah, he goes well
*  we were talking to air traffic control and our panel up here is saying that the
*  One of the wheels is not coming down
*  The left wheel or whatever and and so what we're gonna do is it could be a broke the panels broken and it could actually
*  Be down. We don't know so we're gonna go fly around again
*  I'm gonna ask him to look again just to make sure he's like so just be a couple of minutes
*  So we made this big turn and we go down to land again and again
*  We're getting down to like low low low they pull back up. He comes back out. This is what his motherfucker says he says
*  Okay, so they can't tell it was that night. I don't know. We're small plane. Maybe it's like
*  Bullshit airport he goes so they can't tell this is what he does. He goes, but we don't have enough fuel
*  to get anywhere else
*  So we're gonna go around a third time and this time we're gonna land the plane no matter what
*  So I'm looking at him. I immediately just crying
*  I'm like not crying like her but like I'm just welling up with tears
*  I'm going to die my biggest one of my biggest fears is dying in a plane crash
*  I just I don't like to think about it cuz I don't even want to put out there and
*  I'm like, oh my fucking god and I'm like, you know, and I'm like what's gonna happen?
*  He goes and he goes in all serious. He goes don't worry
*  If the wheel doesn't come down or if it doesn't isn't down the wing will act like a wheel
*  That's what he said to us because the wing is made to like kind of act like a wheel
*  It didn't give me any comfort in the moment. It does it slows down the plane. Yeah, but we're still yes
*  It's spinning out and sparks flying. It's a little plane. You know good. Yeah, and um, oh actually
*  No, that was a night time was that the it was the same exact trip there and back the nighttime trip
*  We were it was like a storm and we're flying all that
*  This was the daytime because they had fire trucks and ambulances lining on the thing because by the time
*  The thing cuz by the time the third time we weren't on they were there so they were there with the waiting
*  So that's another scary thing. I actually took out my phone and I wrote a text to my entire family
*  I have I saved text. I'm just like there's a problem with the wheel. I don't know exactly what's gonna happen
*  I'm literally like my love you send that
*  Okay, now like as you hit I I literally wrote it in full as I was crying
*  I wrote it in full as I was crying and I had it open with my hand
*  Right on the thing, oh fuck so I was just gonna wait and if it just I felt I could just hit it
*  I have I have the text that I see
*  and
*  My friend such a fucking asshole. I'm I'm nervous. Everyone's really nervous, but I think I'm showing it the most
*  My buddy's a nutcase. So he he looks at me and he goes he's a car
*  He's trying to calm me down, you know and we're coming and he goes just calm down calm down calm down
*  And I'm like, all right, he goes
*  And he starts singing fucking la bomba
*  You know, it breaks the tension everything and I'm like dude and I'm crying and laughing so hard because when you're in that heightened
*  state of emotion
*  Yeah, I'm laughing as hard as I'm crying like now now I'm like I don't just I can't even I'm laughing so hard
*  I can't breathe. I can't tell him to stop doing it because I need to be focused right now on the end of my possible life
*  And you know, I'm what and I'm holding my thing and I'm laughing I'm crying and then he goes hold on
*  Let me call my wife and he goes hello, baby
*  Cuz the big popper fucking died for which balance so he goes hello, baby
*  And I am literally can't breathe and I'm holding my stuff he's like will I what and then I'm just like dude
*  I'm begging him. Please stop. I'm like laughing crying. Please stop Joe and
*  And then we went to land and the fuck the wheel was out. The wheel was out man
*  man, we got we got out of the out of the plane and
*  Everybody was like in good spirits and I was still in that place and the fireman came over
*  The first thing that happened was the neck or the fire a guy opened the door and looked at his oh shit
*  He goes God. Can I get a picture?
*  And we get out of the plane and it's the four of us and him take a picture
*  I have the picture everyone's smiling. I'm on the end like this just pale white just not no smile. Just like oh no
*  Yeah, like I couldn't even turn it on for the picture. Oh, no
*  It was my biggest fear coming true like, you know, like yeah, you go there you you literally go there
*  That's what I was saying. Like I I was thinking this
*  Could be how I die right now and I
*  Man it where it takes you is nuts in your head
*  Have you seen this new plane that they've developed that doesn't have wings and it's gonna be able to fly
*  to London from New York City like super quick like way way faster like less than half the time UFO
*  It looks like a spaceship man, and apparently it's got because it doesn't have a traditional shape
*  There's a lot more room inside of it. So it's fucking huge. What? Yeah
*  What's the technology I don't know I was just looking at some article about it and it's it's a new
*  supersonic craft that looks like
*  Instead of like when it looks like a like a giant arrowhead or something. Okay, it doesn't look like a regular plane like that's
*  What I like that
*  That's it right there. Oh, that's not it. Oh, so that this you fly from New York in 3.5 hours in this new supersonic jet
*  Can I see what the images look like? Oh, so this is gonna be commercially marketed
*  I thought it was like military that one seems like it that seemed like a military jet the one that I saw looked like that thing
*  That's it. That's it. 90 minutes. Look at that fucking thing. That's ridiculous. Look at that thing
*  It looks like a train the same thing. Yeah, okay
*  It looks like that's just a view from the top so you can see it doesn't have like a regular wing. It just has this crazy
*  Immense space in the back and you're gonna you're gonna have room to like stretch out
*  They'll just stuff it with humans
*  But probably not because it's probably gonna be super expensive. That's only got room for one person
*  That can't be the same thing. Is it a passenger one? It's an expensive ticket
*  It was talking about one that could seat passengers commercial routes, but hmm. There's like one dude
*  No, but I think there's one that they were working on maybe I'm conflating two different stories
*  But there's one jet that they're working on that is not does not have wings
*  And they were talking about it being able to have more space inside of it because of that
*  Who's who's going on that like?
*  Who's going like once it's like approved is a flight. This is the first commercial flare. It is. That's it. That's the thing
*  Look at that fucking thing. That's crazy
*  That looks like a ufo wingless supersonic jet could transport passengers from London to New York in less than five hours
*  What I don't know. It's like six hours. That's our five hour flight
*  It's like six hours
*  That's the hour faster, but you get to fly in a spaceship. That's not fast at all an hour faster
*  That's crazy, but it's supersonic
*  How dope is that look space futuristic spaceship like aircraft capable of transporting back in a little segment
*  transporting 300 passengers at speeds of up to
*  1150 miles an hour
*  That's yeah, that's like double the speed of a regular jet
*  Even more a little bit more. Yeah, look how dope it looks though
*  Yeah, see so the inside of it is so different because it doesn't have that tube that it's got like space
*  Yeah, but how are we how are we commercializing that like that cabin is gonna be comfortable?
*  I don't know you're not gonna feel 1100 miles an hour. I guess not. I mean we don't feel five six hundred
*  Once you're up once you're up and moving what you feel is the resistance of like getting off the ground, right?
*  Yeah, like this pole
*  And then once you level out in you know
*  Whatever the the the height that you're gonna achieve is whatever the altitude is
*  It doesn't feel like you're moving at all. Yeah, and you're going 500 miles an hour made by a designer
*  It's just it's a concept
*  I don't know that's just like private rooms for two travelers with a bedroom living room and an in-suite shower room and the living room
*  You'll find a leather double seat sofa complete with dining tables a 32 inch flat-screen TV noise-canceling headsets a comfortable double bed a
*  full height shower
*  Vanity unit bathrobes and an in-flight chef at your service
*  I gotta I gotta tell you the flat-screen TV it really it really gets more credit than the desert
*  They get but that's a jet that goes 1200 miles an hour
*  It's a home in the air that was 1200 miles an hour
*  It boasts a 32 inch flat-screen TV when was the last time you saw a screen that was a bubble
*  Can we stop saying flat-screen but it's like what do you it's like the thing is who is it for who who can purchase?
*  That ticket and you're like
*  One of the things I'm dangling in front of you is a 32 inch flat-screen television
*  It says right here nobody has shown interest in building the sky
*  OVE vo yet, but Oscar said he is offering his expertise to engineers helping them in other projects. So this is just an idea
*  Bro, you can use to get a hold of them Saudi Arabian dudes
*  That's who that's it. Guys with all that loot. That's it. They might go. Hey how much to fix this make it work
*  Yeah, I like a guy who's like how much is like all right, it's it's 2 billion. He's saying all right
*  You throw in the 32 inch flat screen you got to do
*  Okay, dude, I can't do it make sure I get my hands are tied man. Let me go talk to my
*  Manager
*  But it's December to remember and you got it, you know, yeah, it's our fucking yeah
*  Tell you what? It's the end of the month sales push. He's gonna let it go
*  It's gonna give you the flat screen with your fucking spaceship Saudi wife walks outside our house on Christmas is one of the driver with
*  A bowl on it. Yeah
*  Stevie's bullshit look how small look at the revolution this get you. I want a big one 32 inch
*  Just say flat screen. That is not that big. Yeah, why not? Just say why not put it's 85
*  Even flat screen why say that? Yeah, then there by no
*  Hey your car comes with four round tires
*  Yeah, oh it's a flat screen right round tires right? Hey, um, what kind of tires you have everybody have around tires
*  Why they keep calling around?
*  Super fun flight thing would be a 12 rows of 33 people each imagine being in the middle. Oh god, if you have to piss
*  Oh my god, you didn't get a bedroom seat. Oh my god
*  The other things they boasted about a shower a TV 32 inch flat screen TV noise cancelling headsets
*  So you can't hear the other people in the poor section scream
*  Seat sofa what imagine someone fucking going ballistic while you're going a thousand miles an hour because people go ballistic on planes now
*  It's kind of a new thing. Yeah, they go crazy see aliens. They start screaming
*  They're gonna take the plane out like it happens. It seems like once a month
*  There's some new video of some guy going bonkers on some guy just rip off his clothes off and ran up and on the aisles
*  They had to land. I just saw that. Oh
*  Just imagine the fear that you would have if you were on a plane and you saw some guy going bonkers. God damn it
*  The anxiety you'd have like fuck. Yeah, as soon as you as soon as you hear it start you're like
*  What's this gonna be? What is gonna be?
*  What if it's like that?
*  Did you ever see that movie 28 days later? Yeah when they shot the chimps up with this thing called rage
*  Yeah rage and Jim gets out. Yeah and gets that dude and then the fucking that was like was that the first zombie
*  We were like they were like super fast
*  Silly Murphy's yeah that in my opinion is the best zombie movie. I saw that two days in a row fuck
*  That's one of like five movies. I've seen two days in a row the second one's good, too
*  I did I would I didn't like I went to it opening next I was like
*  This is amazing and I didn't I didn't like it as much well the first one was so revolutionary
*  You know it was just and it was a different concept like a man-created
*  Zombie virus that just infects everyone immediately instantly turns you into a fucking monster
*  Yeah, but the thing is that that virus is kind of like what rabies is
*  Right rabies isn't as effective because it doesn't turn you into a screaming running maniac trying to bite people
*  But the reason why animals with rabies bite you there they have no fear of you and they bite you to give you rabies
*  They're trying to give it to you
*  Really? Yeah, you're saying that something in the composition of rabies
*  Yes elicits the need yes to pass it on a hundred percent
*  How does that how does how does I don't like it compute that there's a lot of examples in nature of?
*  viruses and parasites
*  tricking
*  organisms into doing things that are not in their best interest and
*  I think a virus could easily find a way to hijack
*  The way an animal's mind works and to force it to be aggressive if it wanted to be transmitted a lot
*  That's the only reason why would make sense that they would want to because if they're so aggressive they could risk death
*  Like an animal being recklessly aggressive is not good for its longevity
*  Right you could be recklessly aggressive with a wolf or something that could kill you and you run up on it
*  Just eats you but if you could bite it first
*  Then you can give it rabies right and then that thing's gonna bite a bunch of other things especially
*  It's big enough to kill you now
*  I can bite everything like there's a bunch of travelers that went across the country like during the Lewis and Clark expedition a couple of
*  Them I believe got rabies. I think more than one of them got raped see we find that
*  What it does not it kills everybody it's not now it's not I know they have rabies shot, but let's yeah on without the shot
*  Is that a certain death? No? Yeah, it's like it's like
*  99.7% certain death. There's a few people that have survived now. They're figured out a way to put people into medically induced comas and
*  The problem is this is obviously coming from someone doesn't know what the fuck they're talking about
*  but what I understand is it's a very very old virus and a dangerous one because
*  What what it does is it works faster than your immune system can fight it off?
*  And so your immune system is fighting off rabies, but it can't win rabies
*  Just it just hijacks everything and makes its way through and by putting someone in a medically induced coma
*  They found a way to reach equilibrium
*  Where the resources of the person's body are not being required anymore and the immune system could fight off the rabies and with medication
*  They were able to do it, but they also like can get you if you just got bit
*  Yeah, how much time you have you have like very little time? Oh, really hours?
*  Oh, yeah, you gotta get to the hospital quickly and they'll test and they'll hopefully they'll if you have the animal that killed you
*  They want to test the animal but they'll give you these shots that are apparently like brutally painful. I think they go into your stomach
*  Like what it what did I ask you to Google right before that?
*  I
*  Don't know the Lewis and Clark thing by having I didn't see that something now dig up like maybe it's another traveler
*  But the Lewis and Clark thing you didn't hear about a guy getting rabies
*  I might have been another one of them dudes making it across the country stories, which I've read a lot of they're fucking terrifying
*  Those days were terrifying but it's just like a virus like that that wants to be
*  Transmitted and then tricks that the animal to being aggressive
*  That's one of the weirder things about viruses they're so sneaky and how they evolve
*  Yeah, like these new COVID strains
*  They realize the best thing to do is be like super transmissible but not that bad right away. You stay alive, right?
*  Right, you don't kill the host, you know and
*  Like there's so many instances in nature of things like tricking things in doing stuff
*  You know like parasites that take over an animal's body force it to do stuff. Yeah
*  Bleak it's weird. The weirdest one is we were talking about this the other day grasshoppers to get this
*  Aquatic worm this aquatic worm climbs inside of it
*  Hijacks his brain and when it's ready to give birth tricks the grasshopper and drowning itself so that it could be born
*  So it just takes over the grasshopper's brain and then leaps into the fucking water
*  So it can be born and so the grasshopper just drowns and it just slithers out of the grasshopper's body
*  Yeah, that's wild tricks it into committing suicide
*  What the evolution of that exactly?
*  How does how the fuck yeah, and how is it so common? It's so insanely common apparently that's wild
*  Yeah, that's fucking so grasshoppers. They're like like they have a number one look out for this fucking thing
*  I think they just have it. I think a lot of them have it. I think they've done
*  Studies on grasshoppers, and I think they've done this on praying mantises, too
*  But a lot of them have these worms in their bodies how often you see a grasshopper all the time you do
*  Yeah, I haven't seen one in years. Where you living?
*  Yeah, I know but still I go where grasshoppers live they don't come visit but where they live is it just grass
*  I mean they live in open field. I mean I
*  Encounter grass you know what I mean
*  neighborhood
*  That's what I've seen them in the past I haven't been yes, there's probably a few
*  I bet you I've seen less than 10 grasshoppers in front of my face in my life
*  Wow, yeah, that's crazy
*  No, I've seen a lot of them to praying mantises you mentioned that they they I don't like them at all
*  They freaked me the fuck out one time was getting gas
*  And there was one on the right on the thing and I was a road trip my friends were going to DC
*  And it was like in the middle of the night, and I'm getting gas my friend
*  It was back in the days when they had the hand-held camcorders, and we're like look at that thing
*  And I'm like dude just like I'm sick right here
*  And he goes here take that take the camcorder. I'm gonna get the gas
*  I'm filming the thing and it just turns and lunges at me, and I it literally looks like a
*  That fucking like what's that movie that alien no no the movie with a starship true the person standing in the corner
*  It was like that horror movie that like a handheld camera. Oh Blair Witch
*  You just hear me go yeah like my voice got so high and then the camera just drops and it just goes to like
*  to static
*  You see it lunge at me first. Yeah, we're lucky they're little huh. Why do they rip?
*  What is that about the ripping of the the head off?
*  What do you mean the praying mantis the female rips the male's head off after they have sex?
*  But she's just a bitch is that it that's that's a lot of a lot of it in the insect community
*  Is that true? Yeah, the one of the worst ones is ants some ants will take the male and
*  The females will take the male and cut all his legs off and just drag them to the colony
*  This is like a history of rabies, and I got to this part of the hair of the dog
*  What is that and work your way back to get this how they used to treat?
*  Rabies before they understood what the fuck it was that what that reference is from here
*  It was recommended to salt and eat the flesh of the offending dog. Oh my god
*  Another strategy included drowning a puppy of the same sex as the dog who had bitten the person and having a human victim
*  Eat the liver raw what I don't know I lost what we're talking about rabies rabies how to get rid of it
*  Cuz they had no idea they knew that it was coming from canines
*  They kind of got that so then you locate a puppy and just kill it wait. No, what year was this?
*  Jimmy this it doesn't say because it says we're the 1982
*  We're in the middle of like Romans the Greeks Wow
*  I wonder if the dog thing worked like if you get some of the rabies virus through cooked meat
*  Burning hair picked from the tail of the dog and inserting the ashes into the wound what whoa?
*  This treatment lives on today in a name and spirit with the hair of the dog whoa
*  Hangover cures which calls for
*  alleviating blood and alcohol induced symptoms with more alcohol consumption learning shit
*  That's what the hair of the dog comes from that's wild. That's crazy
*  You get bit do me a favor you got to just bite that thing eat it put some salt on it for taste
*  But you got to get in here you get a salt up the meat
*  Who do you think you have salt on you like you know it's like
*  But it's probably how they preserve it or something maybe I mean maybe they thought like salt was gonna kill salt
*  I mean, that's how they preserved stuff. Yeah back, then they'd cover meat with salt
*  They'd cover everything like they had wars were over salt like salt was like really important and now the yeah wait for free
*  Yeah, imagine being someone from the salt war days. It's all like the most yeah and going into a restaurant
*  You fucking just twist it whenever you want who the fuck is salt
*  You imagine how they would freak out if you took them to salt bay like what
*  Especially to get the steak covered in gold like you fucking asshole
*  I love salt cake salt salt bay gets bitty like ah how many villagers I had a slaughter to get that much gold
*  Fuck is wrong with you you animal
*  They lost the threat on how they got it this guy wrote a book early 19th century on causes of rabies
*  Ooh
*  Interesting one when you get to like the fourth cause it says what the bite of a rabid animal was named first
*  It was picked is quickly followed up by a cold night air
*  Eating beech nuts a fall and the involuntary association of ideas
*  Can I have some more of the weed that we were smoking just cuz I I need to understand that yeah, yeah, I
*  Don't know what that means this guy was smart and bright for his time
*  It's like just proof that they didn't know what rabies
*  So you don't know what it means voluntary association of ideas can cause rabies it to give this guy credit
*  He is the I think one of the first people to accurately describe it as a disease of the nervous system as opposed to blood-borne
*  What do you think that means an involuntary association of ideas? What does that mean? Isn't that just life?
*  involuntary
*  Association like someone could get some wild ideas in your head and those can cause rabies
*  Is that what it means?
*  Did you want me this
*  This seems so
*  It seems so ridiculous I
*  Didn't I didn't really understand what the sentence meant. What does that mean?
*  Clinical features of rabies patients with abnormal sexual behaviors as the presenting manifestations
*  Abnormal sexual so the rabies wants to be transmitted sexually
*  Yeah, what does that normal sexual behavior mean a 32 year old man with frequent ejaculation as the initial symptom of rabies was first reported?
*  Literature review was conducted using databases including CNK I
*  Sinomed VIP
*  Wang fang data
*  Science direct pro quest Ovid and PubMed in addition to our case 54 other rabies cases with abnormal sexual behaviors
*  Are the presenting manifestations ever reported since 1970 among 55 cases 51 were male durr and three were female
*  Unknown gender for one case. Oh god
*  Even back then with ages ranging from 6 to 71 years Wow
*  All cases were reported in developing countries 46 in China dog bites with a major source of infection and extremities were the main exposure sites
*  Wow
*  That's crazy 83 percent
*  83.6 percent cases had abnormal sexual behaviors as the initial symptoms the major presenting manifestations were
*  What does that word pre-app pre-app ism? What does that mean?
*  pre-app ism
*  Am I reading this right?
*  You get bit by a dog in China and you just started jack
*  Rare condition a prolonged erection of the penis. That's right. The full or partial erection
*  Continues hours behind it isn't caused by sexual stimulation. So that's what this is
*  This is like they're so wild and Randy that they have a constant hard-on and ejaculation in males and hyper
*  Sexuality and females all cases were clinically diagnosed based on medical history and clinical manifestations given no standardized post-exposure
*  prophylaxis all cases died
*  With the survival time between 1 and 15 days. Yeah, most people get rabies die
*  Make story more fun. All right, let me take out the rabie part of it
*  Right, just you catch that you get something where you have that disease
*  You have the hard on you can't get rid of you just keep ejaculating ejaculating is fun
*  How long before it's not like how is it like in 20 minutes?
*  you don't like it anymore a couple days like like if you're just
*  Constantly feeling the feeling of climate of ejaculation. Is it like can you perform your regular tasks?
*  It's another level of health just like that fucking head getting sewn back on the body. It's hell, right?
*  Like in 20 minutes 20 minutes
*  Exhausted you just keep coming
*  I can't take this any. Yeah, imagine like never not being horny. Don't be hell. What is this guy?
*  He's got he has a hundred orgasms a day
*  Well, there you go
*  Yeah, and zero friends
*  He's not nobody comes that hard after 199 there's a hundred orgasms day that's a hundredth one he's
*  Sorry
*  No way if you've ever jizzed more than three times in a day the third one is dust
*  The third was just a promise of future jizz. So that's 97 blanks
*  All right
*  That this person was came out as transgender and suffers from persistent genital arousal syndrome. Is that the thing? Hmm?
*  And what's is there?
*  Yeah, but I mean prove it bitch yeah your pants on that's an HR from being honest, yeah
*  I want I want you to really show us
*  We're just gonna give you and keep you in an aquarium and really show us that you're always hard
*  And this isn't just an act for attention. Yeah, you might be kooky
*  He always got to throw that in but anytime you add some gender thing into like any kind of possibility of someone being kooky
*  Everybody how well can't do that? Yeah genders and you surface it gender just like whoo
*  Wipes the sweet clean. Yeah
*  What a time what a time Salvatore what a time I
*  Can't imagine I can't imagine that so good. Let's say he does have it. What is his life for real?
*  It's just nothing all-time constant nothing, but but he's had enough time to call the news
*  Come watch me come. Yeah, he's a freak guys a freak. This is my 34th time of the day. Oh
*  We have to document these things if you're a journalist otherwise, what are you doing right?
*  Why are you there? But so he can he not work? Can he not be in a relationship? Can you I can't work any money?
*  What money for the government?
*  Does he go to Easter with the family like what is he oh my god?
*  It's really he's really sitting there just orgasm. Is that real?
*  When was the last time you've been over like that when you came for the 80th time of the day?
*  No dehydrated yeah, it's fine. I mean while he's losing weight like a pro wrestler
*  Face was purple
*  That's gotta be old things not blood pressure. You're spending too much time on this. Yes. I think he's full shit
*  I'm just guessing I mean look if he really does suffer from that you gotta imagine like imagine suffer no one believes you
*  You're right. I have to take it back and I apologize
*  Just imagine
*  Because you gotta imagine some people are definitely hornier than other people. Some people are actually asexual. They're like you can keep it sure
*  I don't want it. Okay, but back to our rabies case
*  It says that this happened to someone up to 40 or 50 times a day by the fourth day. Oh
*  man in China God
*  32 year old Chinese man began to have frequent ejaculations. How are they coming out buddy?
*  They just shoot now. Are you touching your dick? Like what does that mean?
*  Frequent ejaculation sign you like you're passing the buck. Do you ever help one along or hit all?
*  All hands free fucking zoo monkey
*  He's like 45 or hands free five were him. The wildest is the chimps at the zoo just jacking off in front
*  Any touch when frequent ejaculations increased to 40 to 50 times on the morning of day for the patient went to a local clinic
*  So
*  50 times a day this dude was not he's like maybe I need to get this looked at
*  Traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of imbalance of yin and yang you're telling me
*  However symptomatic treatment to rebalance the yin and yang had no effect crazy
*  In the same afternoon, he was sent to the community hospital Beijing with the following symptoms headache dizziness nausea malaise fever of 39 degrees Celsius
*  irritability
*  tachyphrasia
*  speech difficulty
*  hypervacillation
*  Hypersalivation he was subsequently transferred to a territory territory
*  Was that word tertiary tertiary hospital third hospital? Sorry in Beijing for further diagnosis and treatment, but the
*  Etiology remained unidentified at around 10 p.m.
*  a day for patient was sent to infectious disease Department of Peking University third hospital and was transferred to emergency department due to
*  tachycardia and
*  dysphonia his complaints included high penis sensitivity painful erections and
*  ejaculations 40 times a day triggered by any touch or
*  Ejaculations without erection and release of the semen as well as headaches nausea chest congestion and fever
*  There was no significant improvement after fluid infusion symptomatic treatment other supportive therapies. No, this is how we're all gonna die, Sal
*  Yeah
*  Someone's gonna hear about this and go. Okay. So what you're saying is a little rabies is really good
*  Well, we need an inert form of raises. What we need is a rabies vaccine that gives you just
*  Constant rock-hard boners. Yeah for guys who like to party, you know, I went blue choose not enough
*  Yeah, when you just want to be a different thing than a person and you also don't want rabies
*  Well, we've got the imagine if like every guy starts doing it just like how many women have fake boobs now quite a few
*  They'll be like what if like most guys it'll be like baseball
*  They want to come everyone's got to do it if you want to compete you gotta get the rabies shot
*  Yeah, did you get your rabies shot? You're 16. You can get a rabies shot 16. Don't listen. Those Robert Kennedy, Junie pussies
*  This is some fucking side effects. Just get your rabies shot get your fucking dick on
*  Imagine if like something switched
*  Well, if you think of animals so like tigers tigers can breed 50 times a day
*  When a female tigers and heat the tiger just keeps fucking they've fucked to the
*  Literally, is that where easy tiger comes from? I don't know what that term is easy tiger. Oh, no
*  Maybe but that's for a short period of time when the females in season
*  If she's not an estrus he won't do that
*  But if a person has sex for fun like if a person could be as horny as a tiger all the time
*  What a terrifying world we would live someone's working on that
*  That's what I'm worried about like if someone just said look look
*  There's certain medications that get created that are essentially performance enhancing medications that you can prescribe to people
*  For stuff, you know, like when they first I think this is true
*  Provisual I think the initial
*  Idea behind check to see if this is true
*  I think the initial idea behind it was using it as a performance enhancing substance
*  But then they couldn't do that because you can't just prescribe something to help people's perform
*  You have to have a sickness and so they went with I think it was insomnia
*  No, not insomnia. What's the other one? We just pass out
*  We faint what's that one? Jamie? We just
*  Narcolepsy
*  So I think they use it for narcolepsy and if you ever taken provigil or new vigil, it's it's a weird
*  Chemical and I think Tim Ferriss when he wrote one of his books
*  He decided to not put it in there because he was worried that people would just eat it like
*  If they knew how effective it was really
*  Yeah, and he but he and a lot of people were of the opinion that there's no such thing as a biological free lunch
*  There's no such thing as one thing that turns on that much of your brain
*  That's probably not doing something that we don't know about yet
*  You know, it could be like fucking something up long term like who knows let's get some studies done
*  Yeah
*  But I've taken it before on trips
*  Like if I had to go somewhere like say if I had a drug like if I did a gig in San Diego and I had
*  To drive back home to LA the gigs done at like midnight, you know, we grab our shit
*  We throw it in the car and it's two hours of driving
*  Yeah
*  Fucking tired it like one in the morning if your head starts nodding off if I take one of those no worries
*  No sleep not happening for how long but not not speedy. That's what's we really yeah. No, no doesn't increase your heart rate
*  It doesn't make you like a blabbermouth. You can't shut the fuck up. It's not like that
*  Yes, it's like a weird sort of like like the idea of being sleepy just gets erased. Is it crash?
*  That's the problem. That's why I think Tim Ferriss was worried about putting in the book
*  It doesn't seem to have much of a crash really I didn't feel it. I mean everybody's different
*  I sleep when you get home. Yeah. Yeah slept you also slept
*  Yeah, I went to I went to bed when I got home, which is like two ish to 30 ish
*  Whatever it took us to drive back drop everybody off. I think I was like
*  Maybe a half an hour later. I was asleep
*  Wow, yeah didn't stop me from sleeping but it stopped me from falling asleep at the wheel or being drowsy at the wheel
*  You know those moments where the fucking road just starts hypnotize you the white lines
*  Yeah, it's like oh no, and you're literally like what am I gonna do like am I ever gonna pull over on my now?
*  I'm gonna push through this it happens a lot for us
*  I'm driving a lot on the road all the time manager Jeff. He gave me the best advice. Yes the best advice
*  I do it every time I know I have to drive it
*  I'm tired you get ice cold water and a rag like a bat like a like washcloth sure
*  That's the best if you have ice in the washcloth
*  That's the best and a little bit of water and put it just get a little Tupperware thing of ice and water and a washcloth
*  And when you feel tired you just take that washcloth you rub your face real quick. It goes away
*  Really? Yep goes away, and then five minutes later you might need it again, but you got it right there
*  You rub it in your face goes away. What happens if you don't like it gets?
*  Nice is the factor not the yeah, you need cold water
*  Yeah, the cold water wakes your face right up and it works it just stimulates
*  It does whatever it has to do to snap you out of this cycle of droning and just people fall
*  Kid I went to high school with fell asleep behind the wheel died it happens me too
*  Actually my friend Tommy had an accident where he blacked out behind the wheel and crashed his car
*  Yeah, I think about this often now because my parents they live in a different state
*  It's like only like 75 minutes away
*  But they come to visit me and then when they can't we both visit each other then they go home
*  And I'm like I'm just getting yeah recently my mom told me she was like I I
*  Don't want to I have to get a coca-cola something because I get sometimes I start to fall asleep
*  I'm like what I'm like don't don't make the drive. Yeah, she's like no. I'll be alright
*  I'm like, but you don't know you that you will like I couldn't believe she told me that like she sometimes like does a
*  Little it was like mom Jesus, you know so she's like alright, so now it's like I don't forget that point
*  Where it's like limited that she can't come to me anymore. I don't know. I gotta get her a Tesla. Yeah
*  She's like
*  74 she asked me for a mountain bike
*  For Christmas so here it does it enhances cog cognition to
*  The drug manaphanol was developed to treat narcolepsy
*  Kinda excessive sleeping, but it's widely used off license as a smart drug to promote cognitive enhancement
*  Where qualities such as alertness and concentration are desired to assist someone with for example exam preparation?
*  I bet they give that shit to fighter pilots, too. Don't you imagine I?
*  You need a laser. I mean the focus that's required is like on like on
*  Humanly they don't I don't think they think about laws like whatever the fuck is the best thing for them
*  Yeah, give them that what are we stupid? Something's written down on paper
*  You can't give them that give him with it with a fuck. He was right. He's flying a goddamn fighter jet
*  Yeah, you want those dude tune the fuck in you don't want them sober you want them on whatever adderall whatever
*  We're the fucking mixture is that stuff and adderall together just like
*  Fuckin low discipline pump them up
*  Yeah, discipline fighter jet pilot with a little bit adderall a little bit of that stuff
*  Just locked and fucking loaded just in there you you don't want any distractions on hyper focus
*  It's your ass. What do you think a fighter pilots like regimen? Do you think there's like they keep a certain regimen or something?
*  They're very fit. At least the Blue Angels are I flew with the Blue Angels once yeah, and the dude that flew with me was jacked
*  And he was telling me that you really need to be physically strong to over because they don't wear a G suit
*  They just use this method called hooking to like you go like this hook hook hook
*  So as the G's are hitting you you're forcing blood into your brain is conscious
*  Yeah, and you you have to be strong to do it so like you go where the Blue Angels are they have weights all over the fucking
*  Place these guys are always working out. I'm thinking cognitive. What about cognitive?
*  You have to be a fucking genius, but they have to have a routine though where they keep themselves sharp, right?
*  I mean like that's part of probably their daily lifestyle. I'm sure always I'm sure there's constant assessments. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure
*  I'm sure there's probably like a lot of drug testing. That's probably making sure you get in sleep
*  I mean they're putting you at the helm of something that cut one of those things cost like what is a what is an fa 18?
*  Cost yeah, let's take a guess is it a hundred million dollars
*  One of those things cost 300 million what is like our that's fully loaded. What's our top of the food chain jet right now?
*  Like what's the best jet the Americans have?
*  Cuz the one I flew in I believe was an fa 18 with the Blue Angels. It was it's insane
*  Yeah, it's insane. They wanted to put us in one of those
*  It's going through the fucking canyon sideways
*  You like
*  Well a couple hundred feet off the ground
*  Yeah, I did throw we put we put the guy in the show on one and he went and he went out and he had
*  Do all the stuff and they said this is what's gonna happen
*  you're probably gonna get nauseous and throw up and black out and
*  You know and and that's exactly what happened and we had all the cameras in it
*  And when he got back we couldn't see it like we couldn't see him
*  So he just took off on the thing and there was cameras in there and then when he came back
*  We were gonna just be like how to go cuz we and he came back
*  He got the thing open. He looked like
*  Absolutely horrified ill sick like Trump traumatic. He threw up he passed out. He woke up. He threw up
*  He passed out he came out he's crying and he goes that wasn't because the guy was just like
*  Merciful with him. Oh boy. Yeah, and he was like, it's not funny
*  I'm not we shouldn't be not even gonna put on air. Did they teach him how to like?
*  Yeah, it's conscious. I'm just they teach him how to do the hooking. Yeah, we there
*  He got a little he got the briefing, you know
*  I got it through the heart and then I got cocky in another part and I didn't do it quick enough and I blacked out
*  The part that I blacked out in was way less G's the part that I didn't black
*  I was like seven G's which is crazy
*  And then I think the one I blacked out was like four or four and a half. I blacked out
*  I just didn't a hook in time
*  I just wasn't sure if I should be doing it now like when to do it
*  Yeah, and the pilot when you hear the pilot hooking that's what's really scary. I hear him going
*  Like oh shit, he's blacking out to like he's experiencing what I'm experiencing. Yeah, what happens if he doesn't the hoots don't work
*  What he's gonna work? Yeah work those fucking dudes. Those dudes are
*  American yeah, if you want you want the rest of world to be worried about America
*  You want to be worried about fighter pilot guys? Yeah real
*  Man, what did you say? No, I had a fucking pilot that got shit
*  What did you see in there though?
*  What do you mean like you're sitting in the jet, right?
*  I mean I'm behind him so I'm seated
*  Oh, I could see you. Oh, yeah this fucking glass around you man. No, no seeing up, right?
*  But something you're just looking into like you can't do you have any sense of?
*  Scale like do you are you looking like you don't see anything? You're just seeing blue sky
*  No, no, no, no, you do that too. Like we did a flip or you do the thing all the way around
*  We did that so but he's also going through the canyons at low altitude. Oh like in Top Gun 2
*  Yeah, oh shit no way
*  We did that. Yeah, you was that just let's do it or did you have to get yourself there to get in that?
*  I mean, I said whatever he wants to do. I'm gonna do that's the thing they do. Yeah, they take you on this run
*  They like have a route they take you I don't trust it dude
*  Well, these are these are the crazy ones when they fly next to each other like fuck all that. Yeah
*  But you're flying in the canyon. It's my friend Mark Smith does that he did that with the Thunderbirds
*  He's a referee for the UFC
*  I
*  have to be an
*  Exceptional human being to be able to pilot one of those things
*  I mean you have to be on your fucking P's and Q's. Yeah, like superhuman. Yeah. Yeah
*  What was that jet you were showing us it just lifts up off the ground?
*  That's our top of the food chain
*  Within 10% of the right 109 million aircraft show a video of that thing that thing is nuts man
*  This thing is nuts watch how this motherfucker takes off first of all looks badass
*  You see that thing coming at you like oh we should have signed a treaty
*  Look how it takes off look out points down at the ground
*  Yeah, look at its asshole. Yeah, it's gonna take a shit on you right now. It asshole tucks down on the ground
*  Look at that. That's insane, dude. That is literally insane
*  Yeah, the asshole tucks at the ground and it just lifts up in the sky. This looks fake
*  Surreal that looks like like the the the lunar orbiter getting pulled from the surface of the moon by special effects
*  That's wild. Look at that thing. Oh, and that's how it lands as well, bro. Are you fucking kidding me?
*  That's insane. That's the best 10 years ago. So this is oh, yeah now now it goes like the speed of light
*  That's visible the old model. Yeah, that's bullshit. That's like an iPhone
*  Someone pulled out an iPhone one today. What the fuck is that?
*  Right like ten years ago in jets
*  Nothing as a cigarette lighter in it. Are you kidding me with all the money that these dudes have to make these fucking things. I
*  Mean, I guess they're just limited by physics, right?
*  They're just limited by propulsion systems and the metal and the g-force and the pilot being able to stay conscious
*  I
*  Percent they're addicted they're gonna do that. You have to they're addicted to this right?
*  I would imagine you have to be addicted to I mean, do you what kind of car do you drive?
*  BMW SUV they're nice. That's a nice car. Like don't you enjoy driving it? Yeah, I do
*  Joyable, right if you're listening to BMW, I like to get in a car and I like to
*  Yeah, drive. Yeah, joy. Oh
*  Man
*  Fucking thing you're gonna race track. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I went to the Indy 500 bank turn. Look at this fucking turn
*  That is so insane. It's just so insane that these things can do this
*  That they could look how it just like hovers
*  Like that's a nutty
*  Craft that thing's nuts. Yeah, it's like it's at it's so agile. It looks like a bird
*  I wonder how long it stays in the sky though. I bet it ain't long
*  I mean, where's all the gas that must be eating gas, you know, like I have a ram truck
*  Drx gets like nine miles to the gallon. No, imagine. Yeah, really? Yeah. Yeah. Imagine what that gets. That's I mean how
*  You just fill nothing. It's probably got a 25 gas tank. Yeah
*  How much how much of a fill up you don't get to eat on that thing now, right you get to eat
*  Yeah, I mean you have a reserve tank right probably no
*  My dad had a reserve tank in his pickup. Yeah a whole second time. Oh, that's a dude worried about the future
*  Got a lease at the right day
*  Do that with a lot of cars because a lot of those pickup trucks people have transport things over long distances
*  No, just this was like a Ford f-150 or whatever. Yeah, yeah
*  What f-150 is probably the most popular pickup truck in the world? Yeah, I think it is probably next to the Toyota's Toyota Tacoma
*  Might be number one like what's the most popular pickup truck in the world? It's either an f-150 or it's a Tacoma. I
*  Think in my head it's a f-150 is a name. I always always always have heard
*  You can't go wrong with an f-150. They've been making those things just like Porsche 911
*  So they were making that same truck from the beginning of time. Just making it better every year for F-150 so this shit
*  They're so durable. My dad had him even growing up like we had their fucking great
*  Is that the number one?
*  That's it. That's it Ford F series most popular truck best-selling truck in the u.s
*  It's been that way for nearly half a century and they fucking deserve it. They're amazing trucks now that you say it
*  I think they say that in the commercial all the time. It's like I said one. I used to have a Raptor
*  The the most recent version the six-cylinder one was fucking great. Yeah great truck man
*  32 inch television no third no flat screen. That's the only thing that sucked
*  I feel like if you're in that plane you need a 60 inch flat screen. Yeah, we need to reorganize my room
*  I want to be in a theater. I'm in the sky a spaceship
*  I don't want this bullshit ass 32 inches is like that bitch. It should look like cribs. That's not that big
*  32 inches is not big. That's like the first flat screen. Do you think I don't know how to count numbers 32 is not big
*  What is that?
*  20,000 pounds of internal fuel has a range of greater than 1,200 Newton meters
*  It was about a thousand miles
*  It says it can fly for like two hours without needing refueling two hours
*  Refuel it in the air so that can stay up forever
*  The point is like when they're on the gas though, I bet it really fucking burns fuel
*  My point is my truck my truck when I'm on the gas. Yeah
*  Fuel it's a little gauge on the TRX that shows you with if you're running out of gas
*  Yeah, it shows you what like your gas mileage as you leave it on just cry
*  gallons an hour when using the afterburner to I want to see a
*  Mid-flight refueling is that I remember on
*  Yeah, do you play like original and send out no top gun on original and sendo you had to refuse one of the things you
*  Have to do in between this they had to refuel in the air and I was like they really do do that
*  That's insane. It's insane
*  Again like those level of human beings that can pilot those things to keep their shit together like this
*  Flying two jets right over each other like that
*  Like what and trusting the guy on the bottom to stay still like shut the fuck up, man
*  This is nuts and you've got gasoline
*  You're pumping gasoline with your robot dick
*  Yeah into the vagina of this thing look out clamps up. That's nuts, dude
*  See how it like clamped in place because if it doesn't clamp then you got gas
*  Spray and all your fucking jet engines that are hot as shit
*  Did I'm more impressed with the the the thing that has the gas in it actually the dick that was made second
*  You know like that's newer technology than the jet itself. It's all nuts, dude
*  I mean just the fact that they have this thing is nuts look at it and
*  It's it's really kind of weird that it takes war for us to make something
*  That's that cool right like that amazing to look like if you're a guy like what a guy's guys love fast cars
*  We love spaceships rocket ships like I know a lot of girls to do don't get me wrong, but men
*  Generally design these things I can the ultimate is that and the only get that if you go to
*  You got to kill people to get that yeah
*  The best of the best of the best minds and the best of the best of the best people that can pilot that thing
*  All driven by war like if Bezos goes out
*  I mean Bezos is like 200 billion dollars because I want a fucking fighter jet man
*  He's sitting around with a super hot girlfriend with a shirt on button to the navel. So you know what I want?
*  Want a fighter jet? He can't even have a fighter jet. That's bullshit. You could have the biggest yacht in the world
*  Yeah, you'd have the most beautiful wife you can have the fleet of Rolls Royce's
*  No fighter jet fighter jetters only for people who get to kill people
*  Yeah, that's good. You can have a gun with a litch. I've gone right you have a rifle
*  You can have a shotgun if you want a short barrel shotgun
*  You got to get a tax stamp and go through the government, but if you want a pistol
*  You know you can get a pistol, but no no fighter jet not a fighter jet. No you can't have a tank either
*  One
*  Shut the fuck up
*  Because it's only gonna last for one flight
*  You buy them yeah, oh my god, that's a jet now
*  million dollars, but you're not allowed to buy that new one what well
*  Talk to Lockheed and you have enough money. Do you think they would sell you one of those jets?
*  Do you think I'm putting this in Jeff Bezos's ear right now?
*  Probably have a contract with the government to not sell them the same stuff that they're selling the government
*  But they might be able to make you a slightly so these are like
*  1991 scroll up a little bit that one was like a little above that
*  1992 but that's a propeller think of the market that you're selling to like look at that one
*  That was a jet Illinois
*  But no one's buying that unless they're a pilot right I mean or so how small
*  Psycho
*  Small as a demographic that you possibly buy leave you could buy these now they have to be
*  Unarmed right they have to have take well helicopters different. Oh my god. You buy a black. How much is really?
*  How much is the call for it's a premium listing call for price?
*  They don't list it translate this into rubles. They don't listen like listing the price. There's gonna shock me
*  Hello, I am calling from Illinois. I seek to buy
*  On the open up I want to know for sure how much for just my children love black walk down
*  Buy a black art okay you buy a 92 jet for three million dollars three million two hundred thousand dollars in Redondo Beach, California
*  Hey look, it's got dope camo on it, too
*  I give you gonna fight smurfs you could blend in with them
*  How inferior do you think that model is to a current model? Oh, it has to be crazy inferior, but still insanely cool
*  But do you think you actually get those missiles I want a missile
*  What was that?
*  Did you ever see that the Netflix thing it was project Odessa right where
*  Dude was a drug runner, and he bought a sub from the Russians, and they asked him who wanted to buy nuclear missiles, too
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, and this is like at the fall the Soviet Union right right right did he I don't think he did no
*  Netflix yes, I watch a lot of stuff high and I think it was a bell yeah, yeah
*  Operational does it it's fucking amazing
*  That's the sub they sold them a sub
*  crazy
*  That's crazy
*  Brother the documentary is amazing because it's all real, but it seems like a plot of like a Guy Ritchie movie
*  Yeah, it's it's so nuts. It's so nuts a sub that's even I wonder you know what I wonder if a sub
*  Like can almost go on or like do you how what level of pilot do you have to be to drive a sub you think?
*  It's a good question. It's probably really hard because you have to do all by instrumentation right?
*  It's like what do you you imagine how terrifying must be if you're in a place that you know
*  There's rocks under the water and you drive around with this tube compressed by a thousand feet of water
*  Just hoping you know bang into something hoping you're all your fucking sensors work correctly. Yeah
*  down there
*  I wouldn't get in one what the fuck dude
*  But I mean like actually like actually piloting it. I know that the reading instrumentation
*  So that's a lot of stuff, but like I wonder what it is actually like to like is he just like
*  I'm just back you know like I would imagine is it just like this and that's now they must have so many
*  sophisticated sensors you know the big theory about all this stuff is that
*  we have sensors in the ocean and
*  They're they're all over the place and that our government and our military set them up there and that they knew when that
*  That submarine with all those rich people
*  Pressed and imploded they knew that when that happened they knew exactly when that happened so all that shit about still looking for the people
*  It was all bullshit. They knew those people were dead, but then so then they the release the fact that they had recorded this
*  Explosion that happened in the same area
*  But the the real conspiracy is they don't think that they have those things under the water to detect submarines
*  that they have those things under the water for UFOs and that a lot of the
*  The activity that we're seeing with all this UFO UAP stuff as things that are coming in and out of the water
*  That's why they're always near the water. I have not heard that yeah
*  That's the wildest one you know like what the government's underwater searching like they have like imagine
*  There's a top-secret program that's
*  Setting up these underwater detection systems and listing systems and and videotaping things
*  Because things are going in and out of the ocean
*  So you have to figure out like where's their insertion point where can we set up?
*  And then just like setting up these monitoring stations to try to figure out what the fuck is going on down there
*  There's a place we can't even go and there's a whole little village of these motherfuckers
*  Spaceships shooting out of the bottom of the ocean and off into the sky. I have enough problems on my mind already
*  I don't need this one. I mean if they wanted to hide and play inside
*  That's the place to do it hide right in the ocean have you watched a sugar what sugar?
*  It's a new show Colin Farrell on like Apple TV. Oh, I saw the preview of that the other day is a good
*  Yeah, it's I've been watching it
*  And it's like I didn't know where it was going and then it takes a real sharp turn and what you kind of thought
*  You were watching you
*  You realize that maybe you weren't it's like I don't I can give it away, but don't yeah
*  I was gonna say if you're I'd say you're fucked it up now. I'm gonna be looking for that sharp turn
*  Yeah, you'll never see it though, so don't okay good
*  Also, my memory is shit. Yeah, I'll probably forget about it. Don't even I was a what we talk about
*  Rabies you you think that alien that they feel that alien matter they cop to like a few months back is real cuz back
*  Then I thought it was now people saying it's bullshit. What do you mean?
*  What do they found they that alien like they showed the alien that they found?
*  What is this one? Did I miss this one?
*  Well the government came out and said that they they literally made a statement saying we have alien matter
*  But like matter like actually
*  You talking about the whistleblower who got in front of was it Congress yeah, they got in front of them yeah
*  See
*  Those things are interesting because it's all just talk until they could show you something, but they showed something
*  Okay, no, there's no bodies
*  Maybe they have something around the same time than that story head of the
*  Excuse me not only the Vegas yeah the biggest story, but like the Mexican mummy that they had that was like that little tiny
*  Yeah, but that was bullshit. I know I'm saying they all I think yeah
*  It's the biggest story the backyard with the kid he's I'm staring at something he get frozen like in his place
*  Yeah
*  And there's like some image in the backyard that you can see on film that they've run through like CGI
*  And to try to figure out whether or not it's fake run through AI rather
*  And they don't think it's fake, but doesn't mean that it's not like a dude in a costume or something
*  It's like you just forget you're just hanging out your backyard the aliens just happen to land there real quick and take off
*  That one him I was following up for days, and they didn't like follow up with them
*  The family's probably undocumented because it seems like they some of them at least are probably not documented
*  They weren't speaking English. Yeah, right wasn't that the case no
*  I mean the kid was because he called 911 they play the call am I thinking of the same one
*  Was there a bunch of people that were speaking Spanish
*  One body cams maybe they don't want don't want the attention because then people are showing up at their house
*  Maybe they really legitimately did see it and they got freaked out
*  Who fucking knows man
*  But if you like individual things that happen like that if it did happen nobody would fucking believe you just like a ghost story
*  Like if there was also if you went out to let your dog out you like come on, buddy
*  Gotta take a leak you take him outside
*  And you stare an eye to eye with like this four foot tall creature with giant black eyes
*  And it's standing in front of this like
*  Transparent glowing orb that it just stepped out of and you're sitting there going what the fuck
*  And you're now crazy, and then it gets back into that thing and
*  Yeah, and disappears into the cosmos, and you're like what the fuck man
*  Yeah, and who do you even tell if you tell me I'll go okay
*  What is that stuff you said you were taking yeah, how much do you take that normal day that person?
*  What's what was yesterday like that person would be deemed crazy stressed out?
*  Problem with your lady. What's going on? Yeah, you're seeing things, but if it is a thing that's just uncommon, but happens
*  That's gotta be that would be the wildest one of all of all the possibilities of all the things that it could be the wildest
*  One would it it would be this is an actual life form that occasionally visits. Yeah, I saw something
*  I didn't know what it was once I was driving
*  At night on the highway was it a vagina?
*  I
*  Got me
*  Where were you I don't know I was like driving home from a show, but I wasn't far from home
*  Maybe like less than two hours away. I know that and I saw the light
*  The sky I mean a flat not a little the sky didn't light up like a flash of light that lit up the sky
*  But it came from like as far as my eyes could think that believe that the distance of my eyes could see it was it
*  Came like it was really far away
*  I was like, oh, what was that and then in like a fraction of a second later it flashed again
*  And it was half the distance and then one more time like I like I mean like one second later of flesh
*  And it was like the flesh was where I was and then there was no more flashes after that
*  Yeah, and my girlfriend was in the
*  Passenger seat, but she was sleeping and I woke her right up after that
*  I was I actually was looking around at other cars even was gonna pull over and say like did you just see what I just
*  Saw but nobody like really stopped. I didn't stop either, but I can't explain it. It's how long ago is this? Um, I would say
*  Maybe a little less than ten years
*  Seven eight years ago, maybe
*  Yeah, I can't explain it really can I know what it's not. I know I wasn't seeing things, you know
*  I got it wasn't like oh there was a building or this light flash. It was distinct
*  It was something I hadn't seen before like the way that the light came
*  I think it's probably some kid on some planet somewhere with a drone. It's having a good time
*  Like a laser. Yeah, it's probably doing a reality TV show for true TV
*  An alpha Centauri. I mean imagine it's like what we're seeing is just like kids
*  Enough people say yeah, right kids toys
*  Yeah, like, you know, no one even cares about what the humans are doing
*  But kids do sometimes kids will send a drone down here. Check it out
*  You know so possible it's so possible
*  Yeah, it's also possible the more time goes on the more I look at those little grays
*  I'm like, why are we even assuming those things are alive like the way we're so the gray aliens
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Why are we even assuming those things aren't some robot?
*  Like we're real close to making robots like super duper close and why would you risk?
*  Sending a person or a living thing right across the galaxy at a fucking billion miles an hour when you know
*  Just use a little robot people. They're really good now like giant heads. They don't talk
*  They can't fuck and you get these little robot guys to go and collect sperm samples from people and fucking take them up into the spaceship
*  And run experiments on them and drop them back off. Yeah
*  Maybe they're all robots that could be true, too. Yeah. Yeah, that could be the future of intelligent species
*  They all become some sort of electronic thing
*  Yeah, that could be that's that sounds terrible for us
*  but if you were being objective you go I could see that that could be possible I
*  I get if I start thinking about this stuff like, you know, if I can't sleep or something
*  I start thinking about this stuff. I
*  I'm in the age right now where I'm having like that full-on existential thing happening
*  Like never happened before but I can't it's all the time now. I'm just like what is going on here? Yeah
*  That's like most people's lives. Yeah, that's how most people think just like it's weird
*  Just wondering what the future will be and just be like, yeah
*  Someone would be around to see it someone in our lineage will be around to see hopefully. Yeah or not
*  Yeah, that's the thing eventually it's gonna be not the I mean everyone wants to look at you know
*  Look at big picture, but really look at big picture like this Sun is gonna wipe us out. We're not gonna make it
*  We're gonna get to a certain point whether it's a billion years from now or whatever
*  It's gonna be where the earth is no longer habitable, right? That's just gonna happen
*  So when we're like, oh god, that's so far away
*  Well, so it's a hundred years cuz you're not gonna make it to that either. So let's
*  Fucking we got now we're in a weird a good we got now. We're in a good spot right now
*  I think cuz I don't know if this is like just historically this happens when everyone feels this but like I'm actually like
*  I'm really nervous about the AI. I really am
*  It's like I just I just feel like this this could be the precipice of the next like just the next
*  Yeah, you know what life becomes not just the next thing but who takes advantage of it and how right?
*  It's like this newfound power
*  It's gonna be so different than anything else you've ever experienced before and who who's in control of it?
*  And it's the second most feeling of unsafeness besides war. It's like it's up there with war, you know, it's like if you feel
*  Unsafe right now like unsafe but not I feel unsafe like in my lifetime unsafe, you know, I don't know
*  Yeah, it's it's very different than anything that's ever happened before
*  Because within a short amount of time it's gonna be a real problem. It's gonna be a real thing. That's smarter than us
*  We're not gonna be the smartest thing now
*  We just stopped right now pulled the plug. Who knows maybe we'll be okay
*  We might not be okay if this thing keeps going or we might be maybe I'm wrong
*  But it's like everyone says that everyone says that but yeah, they still I mean they've been I'm they'll never stop
*  Well, I think the problem is the Chinese government and the Russian government are not gonna stop
*  And for us to stop right now would be very dangerous, right?
*  you know if they become the first if China becomes the first to be able to utilize this
*  Incredible power and just do whatever the fuck they want
*  Where whenever the fuck they want and then it gets better and better and better under the power of this thing, right?
*  that's
*  That's not acceptable either. Yeah, but then the problem is
*  it's attached to weapon systems and if it's attached to weapon systems and all it has is
*  like it has a
*  Desired outcome that it's trying to achieve right and this desired outcome. Yeah
*  It's it's not thinking about morals or ethics or yeah, how many people are gonna die and how many innocent people?
*  What's the most effective way to?
*  Ensure victory and it's gonna just do that. That's gonna be
*  horrendous and
*  If someone from another country decides to do that first that could be a giant problem real quick
*  Because all it would take is dismantling our grid. That's it. I'll take with that and we're fucked
*  It's funny that there's no because like them turning everyone has like knows the theory of how thick turns on us
*  Even the people in positions that are racing to get this technology
*  It's a dog world out there man, but it's like yeah, that's it
*  I mean it's either I guess don't be the one to get it or just you know
*  In a way this thing that could destroy everything there. I mean it's for protection
*  It's if you if we don't keep doing it. We're unprotected
*  It's basically the same argument that we have when we create the nuclear bomb, right?
*  Same argument, right? We have to do it for the Nazis. Yeah, the Nazis get this first. We're all fucked
*  Yeah, this is what I'm saying it war it's like a nuclear bomb
*  Yeah, feels like a ticking time bomb. It really does. I know I mean for with everything you read and it's like the
*  Congress is not ahead of it. Like that's what I'm worried about like they think any type of like regulations and stuff
*  Well, I did a podcast the other day about it and I think part of the problem is they can't really be
*  There's no way they can know everything about everything. There's too many things going on in the world
*  You know
*  if you want to ask them about cobalt mining in the Congo and also ask them about overfishing in the ocean and also ask them about
*  the negative side effects of oil spills and also act what's going on with pharmaceutical drugs and what's
*  There's no way any congressperson. Yeah gun control. There's no way there's no fucking way
*  They're gonna be in charge of all the end. What are your thoughts on the border? And also what are your thoughts on?
*  You know, what about seed oil?
*  Just plug-in holes. Yeah, it's there's no fucking way you can be really well read on all those subjects and be objective
*  Yeah, so we can't keep up
*  They don't know what the fuck is going on and it's happening and all these super nerds are out there coding and and banging away
*  At it and they're about to release chat GPT 5.0, which is gonna be the craziest of all crazy ones
*  That's of all the ones that have happened before like each one of them is more insane than one before and chat GPT 4 is
*  Pretty fucking insane and then 4o is pretty fucking insane
*  Really? And when five comes out to 4o talks to like a girl, I have not interacted with it at all
*  Not one time so I don't really know I see people making images and stuff and you know
*  I'll write a joke in there, you know, write me an email
*  I've seen that weird shit where it's like no, but I love you
*  I saw like those stories that came out with like it was like it was it felt ominous
*  You know like what like these changes that the emails or whatever
*  But like I haven't I haven't really gone past that cuz I'm like, you know
*  But it feels like you have to it feels like you actually have to you worse off if you don't kind of get acclimated
*  I kind of get forced to paying attention to it because of this show and because of my friends like Duncan who's like
*  Really really into it. Yeah, Duncan uses AI all the time
*  Like if he was hanging out with you, he would take your voice from a car
*  Like record you are sitting there talking
*  They would run it through AI and then he would type up a bunch of stuff for AI to say like really embarrassing things
*  And then he would say so why'd you send me this and then we'll just start
*  Yeah, that's it. I mean they did it to Tony the other day. That's it was hilarious
*  That's that's but that's ridiculous. Someone's I saw on a forum or something someone sent me
*  someone took my voice and
*  Made me and and made it the Michael Jackson bad album
*  So and they sent it out. It's it's it's my voice singing bad by Michael Jackson, but
*  Good but it's my voice and it sounds like me to me and I was like this is such a
*  Remember I was playing a doing laundry. I played I hit play and I was like this is fucking nuts
*  And that is gonna be a living thing soon. That's gonna be another Sal. That's gonna be another Bobby Lee
*  That's gonna be whoever the fuck they want to make it. You're gonna be able to make people
*  That sound and look and behave exactly like that
*  We're gonna be able to bring Rodney Dangerfield back from the dead and he's gonna go on tour as a robot
*  I'd see it
*  I'd see it for sure. Yeah, I would I just want to see what it's like
*  That'd be weird. I'm as you brought Lenny Bruce back from the dead, but you didn't let him write new material and he just bombed
*  This is the guy we'd all go to see
*  And you know, he's like stuck in 1965. He still thinks he's hey dig
*  You know
*  He's getting arrested for those jokes that people like nowadays it just like now it's nonsense my grandfather. Yeah, it's so easy
*  That's funny. Yeah, because in the context of like his time
*  What are you saying was revolutionary?
*  Like what is this guy saying but it's hard for us to recognize that wasn't that long ago, man
*  Not even at all. It's not like 60 70 years ago. That guy was getting arrested
*  And
*  For telling jokes, yeah, and they're talking about certain things on stage
*  It's hard to imagine that the society's changed that much was such a short amount of time fifth is at the 50s
*  Well, he was around in the 60s too. Like when did he start getting arrested is the good question? I
*  Feel like it was
*  60s I don't think so
*  Couldn't be still getting arrested then I think he died in the 60s. I think that's I think he died of a heroin overdose
*  Who's arrested the jazz workshop in San Francisco in 1961 for using sexually explicit language
*  Although he was acquitted law enforcement agencies put him under greater scrutiny resulting in drug arrests in Philadelphia and Los Angeles
*  So they just started going after him and he he did do a lot of heroin
*  Apparently, I think that's also how he died. I think he died from heroin
*  And I think he died in the middle of the trials. They were just constantly going after him. Wow
*  In the end it was really sad because there's some recordings of him on stage where he's not even doing comedy
*  He's just reading from his legal papers and talking about his case
*  Wow, so people come to see him and he would just like to rant about his case. It was like sad
*  I have a bunch of it
*  You always see his albums in like that like the thrift stores and stuff
*  I'm like when you go to the record store the used ones like they're always like just a few bucks and like there's so
*  Many of them. Yeah, I I always swiped everywhere on the road if there's a record store
*  I'll swipe any comedy albums I can get whoever old not this that and they're always just like
*  There's the same ones you see all that like readily available all the time like they're no matter where you are
*  It's always like ten, you know, like rapping Rodney's, you know
*  You know or that Eddie that Eddie albums you see everywhere you see the Sunset Strip you see that everywhere. Oh, yeah
*  But I got I mean I get Pat Cooper Alan King and every you know, oh wow, you know, I got what's his name?
*  Dick Gregory, okay. Yeah red Fox. It's come on put him on it's like
*  You don't think to listen to these people and it's like it's out there. You know, it's also like a time machine
*  Yeah, you get to peer into a time in like the 1960s where someone's on stage and some
*  Comedy club in a different universe like the world's different everything's different then
*  Like the reality is different. It's the middle of the Vietnam War. Everything's different. Yeah, they're on stage
*  You kind of hear it in the recording. It's like baked into it
*  It feels you know, I mean like whether it's just what you know
*  You're listening to or just the way they recorded it like I like I actually really like listening to the crowds on the records as well
*  It's it's different. It sounds and feels different. Yeah for sure. Yeah how they react and stuff and they're different people man
*  Yeah, and their context the the civilization they lived in was just so different. It's so little access to information
*  And the difference between people then and now is so vast in terms like how much we know about stuff
*  How much information we have about stuff? Yeah, you know and back then it was why like that kind of comedy was only like a few decades
*  Old it was wild man. Nobody was doing like there's a great series of recordings from Richard Pryor at Red
*  Fox's Comedy Club in LA and I bought a bottom once at a gas station
*  They just had him in like the cassette thing. Yeah, they could buy up and they're fucking great, man
*  Yeah, and they're just these recordings of like Richard Pryor fuck it around making up material work in the crowd
*  You hear like ice and glasses
*  It's so cool, yeah, you just so cool clinking and the clanking and the shaking and stuff it gives like it's like a
*  It's it's its own thing. It's like a you know, you've seen the priors tonight show, right? Yeah, sure. Yeah
*  It just like totally clean cut. Yeah, it was like I know it was like wow. I know it's kind of weird
*  It's kind of weird seeing that
*  Yeah, well that was also George Carlin George Carlin's early days. He's real clean cut and clean jokes
*  Oh, yeah, I haven't seen any or a suit and a tie
*  Yeah, so you can find early George Carlin, yeah, you'd look at me like no way that's the hippie guy
*  Yeah, like no way. Yeah, I got to I don't lose material though. I don't know what was like that early term very clean
*  very like
*  Regular comedy look at them
*  For our entire lives and I've noticed something. Holy shit when the Westerns involve Indians and sometimes they don't sometimes
*  It's Brian Don Levy with a black hat and a crooked card game
*  When they involve Indians the big same eyebrow thing when the Indians finally attacked the Cowboys
*  we've been waiting for it throughout the entire movie you can see them standing on the hill and
*  That's the big scene when they finally get to me you always see exactly how the Cowboys prepare for this attack
*  They're pulling wagons around the circle get them all ladies up there holding up the weapons
*  Come on now tap them petty courts use them as bandages get that water up there. It's a
*  Big hassle we never see how the Indians prepare
*  And still attack right
*  Now the Indians were good fighters just because they started in Massachusetts and wound up defending Malibu doesn't mean
*  We really didn't play the game with them
*  As I say now the Indians were good fighters and if this is so they must have been well organized
*  There must have been a way to divide their manpower. It wasn't just one old chief many moon come Chuck Don a lot of guys running
*  Get it not bad. Yeah interesting. Yeah, it was that premise was you know interesting interesting premise
*  Yeah, see him meet him no one yes. I met him at the Comedy Store, and I saw him perform a bunch of times live
*  Yeah, so I'm live when I was a kid when I was 21 when I first started doing stand-up some live in New Hampshire
*  He bombed really oh
*  Six seven years later seven years later look at them dirty hippie found out about hippie pussy
*  Hey, I'm playing the game wrong
*  What am I doing with this fucking stupid tie-on I mean that is a that is a
*  Coast to coast transformation right there real quick too. Yeah, just a couple years few years
*  Yeah, like what did you look like five years ago pretty so that was 65 to what?
*  65 to March of 72
*  That's crazy I
*  Mean he's nearly unrecognizable. Yeah, he looks way older like he yeah that doesn't look like a seven-assage
*  Yeah, he's hard I guess yeah, that's pretty nuts one of the greats yeah, man
*  Yeah, I mean without all those guys
*  I mean that's what's really interesting about the art form without guys like Lenny Bruce and George Carlin just a few people
*  It's just a handful of people Richard Pryor handful of people red Fox. What would this be now? What would it be?
*  It's kind of crazy
*  Yeah, Rickles sure definitely right Rickles is like the original roaster
*  What an animal that guy was I have a I have a
*  Photograph in my living room that he autographed to me written. It's like if there's a fire. It's the first thing
*  Amazing he was awesome. Yeah, he was so nice. He was so kind to us animal on stage the tax with jokes
*  Attacking people insane. Yeah, you know and for the time and that guy was a murderer
*  Nobody was like him back then I saw him live that could within the last like five six seven years of his life
*  I saw him in Atlantic City, which was great
*  He came in from the back with the horns and everything before he even got to the stage
*  It was 20 minutes of insulting people before he got to the stage. It was great
*  Didn't hold back and then I saw him again
*  Later like I saw him like two years before he died up at Westbury, Long Island
*  And he sat in a chair for this one, but he still did two hours Wow, yeah, that's awesome
*  Yeah, that's awesome
*  And then he I got to go backstage and it was like freaking midnight and he's with his wife and one other couple
*  And he let me come in and spent like you know
*  You know when the people come in like you got to leave like helping him out like yeah
*  He kept waving him off and he like talked to me for like good ten minutes. Oh, that's great. Yeah
*  There's a few guys so like damn it, you know, I'm live
*  Shit, you know saw Kinnison live quite a few times. Oh, wow
*  I saw Kinnison live at least three least three times. I saw him once live at Great Woods
*  Which is like this outside concert area and then I saw him live at this thing
*  I saw his career like start to slump like I saw it in real time
*  Even though I was like it's still a huge Kinnison fan the second time I saw him
*  I was at this like shitty kind of casino we place
*  It wasn't that good it wasn't packed and then the third time was kind of the same thing. You were a comic
*  Yeah, I was just starting out but you weren't like maybe I wasn't a comic yet
*  Like maybe I was thinking about doing comedy. It was pretty close
*  It was like right maybe right before I did comedy
*  But he went from 86 where he was on top of the fucking world to like 88 it had already started to kind of fall apart
*  Yeah, it was wild how quick it happened. Yeah
*  Like he had this one amazing
*  Album and one amazing HBO special and
*  Those two were like his best things ever and then everything after that is just too much party in and blow
*  Yeah, just got caught up in the life and the the material wasn't that well thought out anymore
*  He's just like he wrote his brother wrote about it in his book if you read brother Sam, it's fucking great book
*  Yeah, Bill Kinnison wrote it really if you're a fan of comedy
*  It's a really good book. Yeah, but just tells you how this fucking wild man like how different he was just yeah
*  Just plummeted how long how long was he at that height?
*  You think just a few years, you know
*  I think before he got discovered like before Rodney to like so like I bet like from everything that I've heard from people that
*  Were around back then
*  He came a monster. He came he was already a monster from the beginning. He had been a tent revival preacher
*  So he was a tent revival preacher who knew how to do stand-up Wow, I mean what an advantage what an advantage
*  you know, I mean it's like
*  Like teaching a gymnast jujitsu like they're so strong already. They're so flexible. They have a giant advantage
*  I wonder if he how long it took him to get to that voice of it like, you know screaming and stuff
*  I think he had it from the the tent revival days because there's recordings of him doing sermons and he would do it like
*  that
*  It's like really powerful stuff and that's a form of show business clearly
*  Yeah, and he was really good at it. And so he I've never seen
*  You never seen an old son. No, I've only seen him trench coat guy
*  Okay, but there's some that are online you could find on YouTube him with like a leather jacket on and a comb over
*  It looks like shit Wow for start wearing the beret. Yeah, he's have a comb over, you know, he's shit wouldn't shave the head couldn't give
*  In fact that he bought you want to be a rock and roll guy to see a long ass hair like a bandana
*  It was ridiculous. So that was him
*  Wow last sermon, but he was I did 82 sometimes just reading said he was a dork guy at the comedy store starting in 1980
*  So he probably broke off to make a little money doing a sermon, but this is like what it sounded like
*  I
*  Get to the sermon I don't hear any songs it's gotta be this gotta be smooth is it mostly songs
*  Feel so grateful you can't believe how grateful I feel towards the Spirit of God for what he's allowed me to wow
*  And I know I wouldn't have had it without this church
*  Amen without these ministries that you see on this platform
*  Amen without yourselves. Amen. We've all played a part in each other's lives. We've given to each other. Amen
*  So that was him just preaching was like it's so wild to hear that voice attached to that that context
*  It's wild hear him and he's hear him say as a mindfuck and by the by things already don't blow going crazy
*  Was he already? Yeah
*  He was already kissing, you know, Kinessen was a wild fucking dude, man. He was a wild dude
*  Just through and through got hit by a car when he was five years old me too
*  for four years old how bad not too bad I was playing for my dad and I
*  Went to the hospital, but I didn't break anything or anything. Did you get knocked out? Yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah, yeah
*  I was we were in a parking lot
*  Hundred percent empty parking lot of like a VW post like a veterans post near my house
*  We used to play like and we just playing frisbee fully gated with the only two
*  People in that thing only two objects in the thing
*  We're throwing this frisbee and my dad's friend was walking down the block
*  so he went to the gate to talk to him and I was little I was like except for and
*  He threw the frisbee and it went like over there and I went to go get it and as I'm going I see I was
*  staging wagons
*  Pull in it came around the back. So it's not even from the street
*  It was like in that came in the back and turned around and it started driving that way and I'm little you know
*  And I'm going to get the thing and I remembered I remember thinking oh, it was still coming at me and I get to the
*  frisbee and I pick it up
*  I'll never forget this I picked it up and I fumbled it and it dropped again and I I so vividly remember saying
*  Do I try to pick this up again or do I get out of the way because I just remember thinking like this
*  Person has to see me. I'm the only object in front of him
*  Oh my god, and I went to pick it up again, and that's I woke up with my I my dad was running and I was in his arms
*  Yeah, but it wasn't bad. It wasn't it wasn't bad. I I don't even know if I got concussed or anything like that
*  You definitely are in custody. How cold yeah, okay?
*  Yeah, but that was that was it I got to sue I got five thousand bucks
*  Nice to sue and I couldn't touch it till I was 18. Oh
*  Yeah, it was like a trust yeah, it was legal I
*  Don't know you don't remember it was like 12 5 when I got it
*  That's what was left 12,000 500. Oh, oh because the five got done. Oh
*  It was 14 years. I meant 1200 no no 14 years of I guess you know
*  Jesus I'm smoking. Oh, that's amazing so all the interest interest. Yeah
*  Well I would I have a bachelor's in finance I couldn't just think of that word just now and you ain't going by a nice car
*  Or something no I didn't buy a nice car. I don't know where I went. I don't write money
*  I know you took the hit. I wish I knew where it went I
*  Wish I had a nice story to cap this fucking I know
*  That's all right
*  I still have that the book they gave me it would they would go and you'd have to take it and they would uh
*  They put it under a stamp and it was like it would put the new price the interest you made that month the new
*  Price and it would add it like you're to aggregate it
*  It's a red like Staten Island savings bank like foldable thing so I used to I all through those years
*  It's like pages and pages and pages of like the interest that I still have that Wow yeah
*  The old days and you go to the bank go to the bank remember that yeah mom picked this up from school
*  Check cashed the bank was a knife through my heart dude cuz our bank was so fucking slow every time
*  She got it was 40 minutes. They have no motivation to move quickly 40 minutes. How's your day?
*  How's your day drive through we only the drive through oh, that's what that's what I mean. Yeah, that's even worse you see the line
*  Your car starts overheating you know it always did she have
*  She had that car overheated use a
*  Explode we drive down to the Jersey Shore in the summer
*  We'd be in the backseat bench seats everything like right, but just my mom this thing's a fucking boat
*  Over it would you pop pop pop and you're looking back, and it's shooting black smoke
*  Shooting out of the tailpipe and she used to pull over
*  Pull over on the on the turnpike on the parkway open the hood
*  White smoke pouring out of the hood stunk she should get the coolant from the trunk
*  Just pour the coolant careful when you're opening up the radiator
*  Yeah
*  And like literally just kind of alleviated the problem as we drove
*  But the worst part was like when she was like pick us up and stuff
*  And it would like backfire because it was like it backfired like if you drove it. He was gonna backfire
*  So like coming to school and stuff my mom said she didn't mean to him back so I come into school nothing backfiring
*  Yeah, and then the smoke blowing out and they're like having to get just having to get in the car
*  You know what I mean like
*  Everyone saw it you know how many cars back then just fucking polluted everything they came in contact black smoke came out of every car every car
*  Before they came up with catalytic converters. It was a disaster
*  I I remember as a kid smelling the exhaust all the time all the time
*  It was a little gas
*  Yeah, which like lowers your IQ it was a normal smell to smell it was that's why we're so dumb
