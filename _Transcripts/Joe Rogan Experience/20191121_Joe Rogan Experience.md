# Joe Rogan Experience #1389 - Chris Kresser Debunks The Gamechangers Documentary
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 21, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq4Apc2Xk7Q)
*  Ladies and gentlemen, Chris Kresser. Joe, good to be back. How are you buddy? Good to see you.
*  Great, yeah. We are here because of the film The Game Changers. I watched it, I watched it today,
*  I watched the whole thing from start to finish. And I have to say before we even start, I like
*  the guy who's in it very much, James Wilkes, very nice guy. He's an excellent fighter, he won the
*  Ultimate Fighter. And I don't think he's a bad person. I've only had a little bit of interaction
*  with him just over the past couple days via email. He seems like a really great guy. Yeah,
*  a very good guy. Genuine. We're going to talk, we're just going to get into it. So, what was
*  your thoughts on the film and what stood out immediately? Okay, so a little bit of context.
*  You know, I think this film was the best of all the vegan documentaries that have been made.
*  I'll just say that upfront, I think it's pretty well done as a film. Yes. You know, it's got a
*  big budget, pretty good storyline. James Cameron, Jackie Chan, lots of celebrities, Arnold. You know,
*  it's good graphics, like it's just a well-made film. And I think it's especially for someone who
*  doesn't have the background or science awareness to critique some of the claims. It's going to be
*  really persuasive and compelling. And I've definitely, you know, whenever a film like this
*  comes out, my email inbox just blows up like, have you seen this film? Oh my God, you know,
*  I'm eating meat, I'm going to kill myself. It's the same as cigarettes. Right. And, you know,
*  I was talking to Jamie about it before we started recording. Like I could set my watch to it every
*  year. There's something like this happens and I've got to do a response. I consider it part of my,
*  it's part of my public service. Do you think that they're making these films because they believe
*  what they're saying? Or do you think they're making these films because they are trying to convert
*  people to being vegan and they think that distorting reality and just bending things and cherry picking
*  data is acceptable because the long run, the benefits of getting the world to shift over to
*  a vegan diet, it's worth not being completely objective or honest about the actual facts.
*  No, I think they believe it. I think people like, I mean, James, for example, I think he's
*  genuinely trying to help people. I think he's looked at the data and he just came to a different
*  conclusion than somebody like me has. And, you know, I mean, this is, there's something called
*  confirmation bias. I'm sure many of your guests have talked about, but it's a basic human tendency
*  where we tend to only look at the data that support our point of view and discount the rest of it.
*  Right. And it's, you know, even really, really good scientists have a hard time overcoming that.
*  Everybody is guilty of it to some degree, including me. But I think, yeah, so I think
*  generally the people who are making these films really believe in it. They believe in
*  the power of vegan diet, you know, from a nutrition perspective, and they also believe that it's going
*  to help save the world. The beginning of it, I thought was so strange when James talked about
*  being injured and doing all the research that he did, which seems like an extraordinary amount of,
*  what do you say, like a thousand hours of research. And that the thing that stood out was that the
*  Roman gladiators, at least in this one particular location, according to the analysis of their bones,
*  it appears that they had a vegetarian diet. Yeah. They ate a lot of grain.
*  That was strange too. I mean, first of all, gladiators were basically prisoners of war
*  criminals. So the diet they're being fed is not-
*  Prison food.
*  Yeah. It's prison food.
*  They're slaves that are forced to fight to the death.
*  They had a life expectancy of about two years once they became a gladiator. And it's interesting,
*  they featured Fabian Kahn, who is the scientist, you remember, who they talked to and definitely
*  seemed to kind of buy into the plant-based diet idea or the idea that they were vegetarian, you
*  know, by design or by choice. And they didn't talk to his collaborator, Carl Grossman, who's been
*  quoted in the media saying, here's a quote. And by the way, all of the references, full
*  bibliography, show notes, everything are at Kresser.co.
*  slash game changers. Cause I want this to be totally evidence-based. People can check
*  what I'm saying right there. So he said, the vegetarian diet had nothing to do with poverty
*  or animal rights. Gladiators, it seems, were fat. Consuming a lot of simple carbohydrates,
*  such as barley and legumes like beans was designed for survival in the arena.
*  Packing in the carbs also packed on the pounds. Gladiators needed subcutaneous fat. A fat cushion
*  protects you from cut wounds and shields nerves and blood vessels in a fight. So they were basically
*  fattening them up so they could survive longer in the arena. It's not an ideal diet for, you know,
*  fighting and muscle protein synthesis and nutrition. It was basically to fatten them up so they could
*  survive longer. Yeah, this seems so obvious that I couldn't believe it was actually in the film.
*  It just seemed blatantly deceptive because everyone knows what their life was. It's not like these
*  were these elite athletes that were competing in the Olympic games. These were people that they
*  were sending out to die for other people's enjoyment. Right. And the name, my Latin's
*  terrible, but I think it was hortiari or something. It means like barley eater. It was an epithet. It
*  was an insult. It wasn't, you know, a compliment. It was like, haha, you can, you only can afford to
*  eat barley. So yeah, it was a bizarre way to start the film. I thought there could have been better
*  ways to do it. And let me also just say like, if this film, if the purpose of this film was to say,
*  it's possible to thrive on a plant based diet and look, here's some athletes that have done that,
*  I wouldn't have had any qualms with it. Clearly there are examples of people who thrive on a plant
*  based diet. If you follow the diet correctly, it can be done. Rich roll. We talked about last time,
*  Scott jerk, who's one of the athletes in the film seem to do well. Doddy Boush, who's one of the
*  athletes in the film. If you really plan it well and you understand what you're doing and you're
*  on it, it's totally possible. I no dispute with that. But where I take issue with it is it went
*  a step further and said, this is the optimal diet for athletes and everybody else, which, you know,
*  even though it was a film ostensibly about athletes, it definitely crossed the line into
*  this is the approach that everybody should do. Yeah. I mean, they made these claims like all
*  of a sudden people got stronger and faster and more endurance. Like there's no evidence to support
*  that. There's no evidence other than their anecdotal statements of what they did. There's no one has
*  ever put anyone on a vegan diet and then run them through extreme endurance tests and found
*  the significant increase in VO two max or muscle strength or any of those things. None of this has
*  ever been done. So if it's, if it's true anecdotally for these people, it would have been really
*  interesting if there was some actual data to go with that where they showed studies. Right. I mean,
*  we have James talking about his ability to do the battle ropes that all of a sudden he could do an
*  hour and before he could only do 10 minutes. Well, I find that really hard to believe that you gained
*  50 minutes of your battle rope time just from ropes. And if that was the only thing in the film
*  that I found hard to believe, you know, I'd have to let it go. I mean, the guy's an athlete. He's
*  an amazing athlete. He was a great fighter. He's got fantastic. Endurance is excellent
*  martial arts technique. I would just buy it at face level or face value, but there's a lot of those.
*  There's a lot. And I mean, we can go through it and talk about, I mean, there's that problem,
*  which is there's no peer reviewed evidence to back that up. But even the anecdotal evidence is a
*  little shaky is when we start to talk about some of the athletes in the film and then also examples
*  of athletes outside of the film who, you know, switched to a vegan diet and we look and see what
*  happened to them after they did that. The problem here is something that I call the vegan honeymoon,
*  which is, you know, you take someone who's been on a standard American diet, they're eating KFC,
*  McDonald's, et cetera, and they switched from that to a plant based diet. Well, of course,
*  they're going to feel better. They've gone from eating absolute crap to real foods. And so for a
*  period of time, they're going to feel better for sure. But then what happens over a longer period
*  of time, you know, some not getting enough protein just in terms of quantity and not getting the
*  right quality of protein, that starts to have an impact. Micronutrient deficiencies, you know,
*  vitamin A, zinc, calcium, iron, things like that take a while to develop. So you're not going to
*  see that decline in performance happen right away. It might take three months, it might take
*  six months, it might take nine months. It depends on all kinds of factors, genetics, health status,
*  going into it, the type of exercise and activity that they're doing, the way they're implementing
*  the diet, et cetera. So you have to not just look at what happens a month after someone goes vegan.
*  You have to look at what happens six months, a year after or two years after. And we can look
*  at specific examples of that. So in the absence of the correct amount of amino acids, the correct
*  amount of specific nutrients, you start to see a slow decline. Right. So and this is something that
*  they're not taking into account. Yeah. One of the things they talked about was protein content. And
*  I immediately knew that this was not correct or that they were being deceptive. They were talking
*  about three ounces of steak versus what do they compare a peanut buttered sandwich and maybe some
*  lentils? Is that what it was? Oh, boy. Well, the problem is the amino acid profile of that steak is
*  far superior. The amount of protein that your body absorbs is far superior. You're talking about a
*  completely different thing. This is known science. You can get as many amino acids from plant-based
*  proteins, but you need to eat a higher quantity. Yeah. Right. That's what's important. It's not
*  the overall grams of protein. It's the quality of the protein. What's the amino acid profile of the
*  protein and how does your body absorb it? Again, this does not mean like I'm a giant fan of hemp
*  protein. I eat that stuff all the time. It's great. It's just you can't say that protein grams are
*  equal to protein grams because they're not. No, but it's even worse than that. Jamie, pull up
*  slide four if you can. I made some graphics here because it's sometimes easier to understand when
*  you're looking at a picture. For the peanut butter sandwich thing, it was like there's the
*  same amount of protein in a peanut butter sandwich as there is in three ounces of beef. I looked up
*  the data, of course. Three ounces of 90% lean ground beef has 24 grams of protein. You get two
*  slices of wheat bread. We'll give them the benefit of the doubt that it's whole wheat, not white bread.
*  That's five grams. One tablespoon of peanut butter is four grams. You'd have to have five
*  tablespoons of peanut butter in that sandwich to equal three ounces of beef. That's a third of a
*  cup of peanut butter. That's a lot of fucking peanut butter. You ever made a peanut butter
*  sandwich with a third cup of peanut butter? I probably have, but I'm a glutton. I'm a legit
*  glutton. I've probably done that many times. And that's 600 calories versus 200 calories from the
*  ground beef. Just for the same amount of protein. Same amount, just quantity. We're not even getting
*  into quality yet. I'm going to get into that in a second, but we're just talking about quantity
*  of protein. But I think they were saying peanut butter sandwich and a cup of lentils, right? Wasn't
*  it the combined? No, I think they said three or a cup of lentils. Or was it a war? Yeah.
*  But the reality is it probably would plus a cup of lentils. Yeah. Then as you pointed out,
*  it's all about protein quality. And this is, as you said, this is an established science,
*  firmly established science. They look at this, especially like in third world countries where
*  protein deficiency is common. So they try to figure out how to address that. What are the highest
*  quality proteins that we can feed these people to bring them up to where they should be in terms of
*  protein intake. So the most recent scale that's used is called the DIAS, digestible, indispensable
*  amino acid score. So it ranks proteins according to two main categories. One is the amino acid
*  profile. And as you mentioned, when it comes to protein quality, it's not just does the protein
*  have every amino acid, you know, this is what's a little disingenuous about the film. They said
*  every plant protein has every amino acid. Well, yeah, nobody disagrees with that. But does it
*  have enough of each of them? That's the key question. What's the quantity? What's the profile?
*  So the DIAS looks at amino acid profile, but then it also looks at bioavailability. A protein is not
*  worth much if you can't actually digest and absorb it. So it's a complex, you know, algorithm that
*  combines all those things and then it ranks the proteins on a scale. So the DIAS for beef, rare
*  beef is 1.39. It's among the highest scores on the whole scale. The DIAS for egg is 1.13. For peanut
*  butter, it's 0.45. And for wheat, it's 0.2. Those are among the lowest proteins that have been measured
*  on the scale. So even if the quantity was the same, the effect on your body, particularly on
*  things like muscle protein synthesis, which is of concern for athletes is not even in the same ballpark.
*  And when they're talking about the USRDA, they're talking about like how much, you know,
*  the United States recommended daily allowances. That is, isn't that just to be healthy, like to be
*  alive? Not even healthy, but to be alive is more accurate. It's the amount that's required to
*  avoid malnutrition, technically. I know that. So why don't they know that? I'm not doing any
*  documentaries on food. Why don't they know? That seems like, so to use that as a reference point,
*  to use that as like, look, you can get this. That's plenty. That's crazy. Well, that's a common
*  argument in the vegan community. And they, you know, I don't know whether it's because they
*  they really don't understand the science behind it or because they do and they're just, you know,
*  it's being kind of exaggerated to suit their claim. I can't know that, you know.
*  This is what I think it is, honestly. There's a lot of vegan influencers and there's a lot of
*  people that make YouTube videos and people who produce things like this. And then the other
*  folks just parrot what they say. Right. So instead of reading the actual studies and talking to
*  objective researchers who have gone over the evidence and disputed the claims that are in
*  these films, like a debunking of one of these films will get way less views than the actual film
*  itself. That's just how it goes. Nobody's going to watch. And so especially the people that are
*  already convinced, for them, it's like, excellent. I knew Jesus was real. Now I've got the proof.
*  You know, I mean, it's really like that. It becomes, the ideology becomes so strong,
*  it becomes like a religion. And look, I've been accused of it from doing it from a meat perspective.
*  I understand. I understand that you would think that if you had an opposing vegan or vegetarian
*  perspective. I totally understand. But man, you know, we saw it with the Joel Kahn discussion,
*  and you see it almost every time someone who's actually informed has a conversation with one of
*  these influencers. Like they're not being 100% accurate, objective, or even honest in a lot of
*  cases. Yeah. I mean, there's a great Leon Festinger quote, I don't know if you've heard it.
*  A man with a conviction is a hard man to change. Tell him you disagree and he turns away. Show him
*  the facts and figures and he questions your sources. Appeal to logic and he fails to see your point.
*  The best argument in my opinion is this factory farming is disgusting and that the cruelty of
*  treating animals like a commodity and serving them up for slaughter in these horrific conditions,
*  these factory farming conditions and these horrible pens that we've all seen. That's the
*  argument for veganism. I agree. But when we're talking about performance and health, this is
*  where it just gets very frustrating for me. Because like if you want to make an argument that you
*  should probably follow a more complicated diet, more complicated meaning that it's more difficult
*  for you to acquire in some cities. You have to be a little bit more careful about getting
*  supplementation with vitamin B12 and essential amino acids. You got to be a little bit more
*  careful if you want to maintain a healthy, robust life. It's possible to do that, but it's a little
*  more complicated. And if you want to say, I want to live like that because the way I feel about
*  eating animals makes me feel terrible. I don't want to have any part of that. And I found out that I
*  can not have a part of that and I can live my life. That's great. But that's not what they're saying.
*  And there's a lot of problems with that argument too. I want to come back and spend some time on
*  that. But we can do it right now before we move on because it is okay. We just covered it.
*  All right. So I want to go back to the RDA. I don't want to forget that because that's super
*  important. Yeah. So where to start with that? So first of all, the idea that plant-based agriculture
*  doesn't kill animals is just false. I mean, there have been studies that show that particularly
*  monocropping type of plant agriculture kills far more animals than are killed from eating cows,
*  for example. Insects, rodents, mice, birds, fish, all killed in the process of industrial agriculture.
*  And so that presents an ethical dilemma, really. If you are saying, I'm a vegan because I don't
*  want my food choices to involve killing animals, is killing a whole bunch of small, non-mammal
*  animals better than killing mammals? Or what about killing more small animals than one cow?
*  Size. Does size matter? Where do you draw the line between an animal that is
*  like sentient enough or cute enough maybe to not be killed versus-
*  Let me clarify what you're saying too. You're saying more animals per meal.
*  So if you want to have a meal out of wheat, most likely more animals are going to die than if you
*  want. It's like if you have a hundred wheat meals, a hundred meals with wheat in them,
*  you're probably killing more animals than if you have a hundred meals with cows in them
*  because that's like a cow. Yeah, I don't know the answer to that question. I'm comparing
*  kind of the whole process, like eating animals versus eating plants. And I don't know if that
*  per meal comparison has ever been done, but I'm just saying that that's an interesting ethical
*  question. Let me give you their argument for that. They say that most of these monocrops are to feed
*  animals. Yeah, that is a problem. Where I agree with this film is that conventional livestock
*  practices are harmful to the planet. Right, but what they're saying is that you're saying that
*  eating a vegan diet and all these monocrops, that these monocrops are killing all these small animals.
*  They're saying no, these monocrops, most of them actually exist to feed livestock.
*  That's not true. I mean, if you follow this through, I mean, especially when you start
*  talking about like fake meat and some, you know, they're all, what are those based on? Soy.
*  Coils, yeah. Yeah, they're industrial crops. They're not, you know, grown on the family farm.
*  These are industrial GMO monocrops. Massive, massive. On a massive scale. There was a great
*  study published in the journal PNAS in 2017 and that it was specifically addressing this claim of
*  would removing animal products from our diet have, you know, saved the world? Basically,
*  would it reduce greenhouse gases? Would it improve our nutrition? Basically, they found that it would
*  only reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2.6 percent, but our intake of carbohydrates, total calories
*  would go way up and the incidence of nutrient deficiencies would go way up. And they did the
*  math and found that without animal products, domestic supplies of calcium, EPA and DHA,
*  which are the long chain omega-3 fats, retinol and B12 were quote insufficient to meet the
*  requirements of the U.S. population. So translation, everybody would have to be supplementing with those
*  nutrients if everyone went on a vegan diet. And they went on to say that basically there's already
*  a surplus of calories in the diet of 145 percent. If everyone went, if we removed animal products
*  entirely, that would go up to 230 percent. So that because the volume of calories in food that would
*  be required to meet basic nutrient and protein needs would be that much higher. So, you know,
*  there's a lot of downstream consequences that I don't think have been fully thought through.
*  Even if a plant-based diet might work for one person, will it scale? You know, if you take that
*  to the full level of like everyone eating a plant-based diet, which is the argument that
*  is being made, does it really work from a nutritional perspective, from an environmental
*  perspective and even from an ethical perspective? The environmental perspective is legitimate. They
*  both cause environmental damage, both animal agricultural and plant agriculture. There's no
*  way around it. Industrial practices cause environmental damage. And if you want to feed
*  320 million people, you're not going to do it through organic farms. You're going to have to,
*  I mean, you can grow food in your neighborhood. I mean, if you live in a small town, you guys can
*  have a co-op. You can have food in your backyard that you can grow. But if you're living in a city
*  like Los Angeles, it's highly likely your food is not coming from that city itself. So that means it
*  has to be grown. And if you're going to grow food for 20 million people, you need a giant chunk of
*  land. If you need that giant chunk of land, even if everybody's eating vegan, that means wildlife
*  is going to be displays the area where you're growing crops. It's going to be a monocrop culture.
*  You're not going to have all these plants living together like they do in the wild. That's just not
*  how you grow food for 20 million people in a very specific area. You just don't do that.
*  Yeah, I know you had Joel Salatin on the show a while back and Alan Savery talked a lot about
*  this. One of the biggest issues right now is soil. Soil erosion. Soil is eroding. The FAO has said
*  we only have about 60 harvests left if soil continues to degrade at the rate that it's going.
*  And so one of the arguments for regenerative, holistically managed livestock is that that can
*  actually help regenerate healthy soils. And some like Joel Salatin or Alan Savery would argue that
*  that's the only way we're going to be able to feed the world because only about 60% of available
*  land is not suitable for cropping. Even if we decided, hey, let's just plant soy and corn and
*  plant plants everywhere. We couldn't because it's too rocky or hilly or the soil is not adequate
*  to do that, but it could be used for livestock. There's a thing that they keep saying that you
*  touched on a little bit earlier. The thing is that greenhouse gases and they were talking about the
*  greenhouse gases from meat and it's just a fake number. I mean, it's over the top. It's over the
*  top. Not true. The specific number is 9% for all agriculture, all agriculture, including growing
*  crops. The vast majority of all of our greenhouse gas issues are coming from transportation and
*  from industry. This is undisputable. So this is where I wonder too about whether it's, is this
*  are they not aware of what's happening here or is it disingenuous? So here's the thing. Here's what
*  they did, Joe. So the number in the specific number in the film, they say greenhouse gas
*  emissions from cattle are 15% and they compared that to 14% for all of transportation. But the
*  problem with that is that they're using the full life cycle analysis for livestock. So that means
*  the carbon needed for feed, for transport, for processing the cattle, not just emissions,
*  not just methane burps from the cattle. Whereas for transportation, they're only looking at what
*  we're called direct tailpipe emissions, just the emissions that come out of the tailpipe. They're
*  not looking at the carbon needed to manufacture the vehicle, the cars, the buses, the airplanes,
*  the inputs for making the fuel, the fuel production and distribution, the final
*  use of the fuel. That life cycle analysis for transportation hasn't been done just because
*  it's enormously complex and it would be a phenomenally big number. The EPA has estimated
*  that something around 80% of the greenhouse gas emissions comes from industry, basically fossil
*  fuel. So it's not an apples to apples comparison. They're doing the full life cycle for livestock
*  versus just the direct emissions for transportation. Well, if we look at just the direct for both,
*  it's 5% for livestock globally and 14% for transportation. But in the US, it's only 3.9%
*  for livestock because we have more efficient practices here versus 14% for transportation.
*  So not even in the same ballpark. And it's just, yeah, I mean, they can just say that in the film.
*  Most people will hear that in other head because they've heard those numbers before, but the devil
*  is always in the details. But what's going on is what you see in a lot of these videos where only
*  person gets to talk. One person who has a specific agenda gets to cherry pick the data and distort it
*  and then put it on the film. I mean, you can accuse us of doing that right now because both of us are
*  clearly on the same page. And I would be happy to have James come in with you afterwards.
*  But we decided- We did it with Joel.
*  Yes. Well, James is way more reasonable than Joel and not slimy. So I'd be happy to do that.
*  And I think that when it's all said and done, I would just like people to be informed. And
*  everyone is going to have their own ideological bias. Everyone's going to have their own
*  preference. But to make poorly informed decisions or that's being kind, to be more blunt, deceptive
*  information forming your decisions and having health consequences because of that,
*  to me, pisses me off and freaks me out. Because the health aspects are not being represented
*  accurately. Yeah. It particularly bothers me when kids are involved. There was a case recently where
*  I was going to tweet it, but I was like, God damn it, I can't even tweet it. So sad where a child
*  had died from malnutrition because the parents were feeding in a vegan diet and all the other
*  kids look like they were starving to death too. And then the social workers came in and it's a
*  goddamn nightmare. And if you hear about that from people that are starving their kids on a regular
*  diet, they're just either extremely poor or they're monsters and they're treating their kid terribly.
*  These people don't seem like they're bad people. No, they believe in what they're doing. They're
*  trying to do the right thing. That's the scariest part about it is that you're seeing that this
*  diet, again, you can do it correctly, but it's fucking complicated. It's hard. Yeah. Just one
*  more thing on the greenhouse gas question. All the numbers I just gave you were from conventional
*  methods, like basically CAFO beef. When they have looked at regenerative, holistically managed
*  livestock, they've found that it can either be carbon neutral or even a carbon sink.
*  So there's a guy who's written some papers on this, Richard Teague. And in his 2018 paper,
*  which again, you can find on my website, thecrestler.co.gameshangers, he found that
*  these larger, more complex, holistically managed sites can sequester between three to four and even
*  up to seven tons of carbon per hectare per year. So these holistically managed beef operations
*  are actually removing carbon from the atmosphere. How does that work? How are they doing that?
*  This is a little out of my wheelhouse, but it's part of the whole methane cycle, the natural
*  biogenic cycle. And the difference, and this is important to understand, is the difference between
*  transportation, which is basically taking out fossil fuels that have not been part of that
*  natural cycle for millions of years and then just emitting them into the atmosphere. With the carbon,
*  the biogenic carbon cycle, you have methane, cows are burping out methane. Methane goes up
*  into the atmosphere and then via hydroxyl oxidation, it's converted into CO2 and water
*  vapor. Then the plants take in CO2 and then via photosynthesis, they convert it into food,
*  basically. And then the cows eat the food and the whole cycle keeps going.
*  And this is a natural cycle? This is not something you have to use equipment to achieve this?
*  This is a natural cycle.
*  So it just has to be a certain amount of plant life in their area?
*  So the way that, I mean, like Joel Salatin, for example, from Polyphase Farms and the Savoury
*  Institute, they basically educate farmers on how to rotate their livestock. Again, this is not my
*  area of expertise, but rather than just having the cattle stay in the same place the whole time,
*  like in a feedlot, they're moving the cattle around, the cattle are pooping, then they bring
*  the chickens to where that was, where the cattle were, and they move it around in a way, again,
*  I don't fully understand. But the effect of this is that the amount of carbon that is sequestered
*  from the atmosphere is greater than the amount of CO2 that is emitted. And these life cycle analyses
*  have been done and published in the literature. It's true that right now that type of holistically
*  managed livestock is not very common, but that doesn't mean that it's not what we should be doing.
*  And this is the thing, with the film, I agree with the problem, the premise, which is that
*  the feedlot beef production is a nightmare. It can be bad for the environment, and we have to do
*  something about it. Where we disagree is what the solution is. They go to a plant-based diet or fake
*  meat or lab meat, I go to regenerative, holistically managed livestock.
*  Okay. So this animal, the regenerative livestock production, doing it in this method, is that
*  sufficient to feed everyone? The production? I mean, how much land do you need to do something
*  like this? So I knew you were going to ask that question, and I talked to the Savoury Institute
*  about this and a few other people. And basically, one response is it's the only way we're going to
*  feed everybody, because as I mentioned, there are only 60 harvests left because of soil degradation.
*  So continually trying to scale up industrial plant agriculture with soy and corn and all of these
*  kinds of crops is going to further degrade the soil, and at some point, we're not going to have
*  any soil left to grow stuff with. That's an important factor, right? We should talk about
*  this, that you need compost and you need fertilizer, and you need something that replenishes the soil.
*  And doing these large-scale monoculture crops when you have these enormous areas, they're just
*  depleting, right? They're just pulling, and then they have to add. You can't make something from
*  nothing. That's the thing. We're not choosing between one really good alternative and one
*  terrible alternative. That's not a choice, like you were saying before the show. That's not even
*  a choice. You just do, you just obviously do the right thing. We're choosing, it's like on the one
*  hand, if we try to scale up plant agriculture in an environment where according to the FAAO,
*  our soils are in only quote, fair, poor, or very poor condition, and we only have 60 harvests left
*  due to rapidly deteriorating soil due to erosion and nutrient depletion, then we desperately need
*  new methods of restoring healthy soil. And if we can do that with regenerative, holistically managed
*  livestock, which has been shown in the scientific literature to be possible, then that may be the
*  only way we can feed everybody. So we would need to almost have a reversal, if that was the case,
*  and have more animal agriculture than plant agriculture. But not the way it's being done now.
*  Right. It would have to be, so they would have to be like Joel Salatin set up. Yeah, so
*  poly face farms. Three things to happen. One would be we'd need to return all the
*  crop lands that are being used to feed livestock and feed lots right now to grassland. And number
*  two, we'd need to put all unused land like the rocky hilly soil that, or land that can't be used
*  for plant agriculture into production with animals. And number three, farmers and ranchers would need
*  to adopt regenerative practices. So I'm not saying, this is an enormous undertaking. We're
*  talking, but so is feeding the world with plant-based agriculture. Whichever direction we go,
*  we're talking about really systemic change that needs to happen in a big way.
*  You'd have to have all of the meat be grass-fed meat, because they would be eating what they
*  naturally eat. Now, what is the percentage of grass-fed meat in this country currently?
*  I don't know for sure. I think the number I read was something like two or three percent. So very
*  low. Very small. Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. Many, many people prefer grain-fed meat. They
*  like it fatty and sloppy. I mean, that's what it is, right? A lot of people like that. Well,
*  what's interesting, and I didn't even know this until a few years ago, even fact, you know,
*  feedlot meat is mostly grass-fed. It's just what happens in the last like five or 10%
*  of the process. So it's like 90% grass-fed and then it's grain-finished. And that grain finishing
*  gives it the marbling that is what you're talking about. It makes the animals sick.
*  I mean, that's really, they're not supposed to eat that. Really, that's what it is. And we've
*  gotten addicted to animals eating things they're not supposed to eat and the way their flesh comes
*  out. Yeah. I mean, a lot of that is that you're eating things like soy cakes, you know, which is
*  a byproduct of soybean oil production. Soybean oil consumption has grown like a thousand fold in
*  the past 120 years. It's now the number one edible oil that we eat. Because if you go into
*  the supermarket and you look at any food label, it's soybean oil, soybean oil, soybean oil.
*  So the oil is valuable. And then they take the cakes that are left over from the oil production
*  process and feed them to cows. And so yeah, they're eating stuff that they wouldn't normally have
*  eaten in that scenario. Yeah. So both scenarios, as you said, are almost insane. They're feeding
*  everyone. And then also like, what do we do with the animals? If we're going to stop eating meat,
*  like let's say if this entire country stops eating meat, what do we do with the animals?
*  We give them birth control, make them die of old age? Do they go extinct? If they don't go extinct,
*  who houses them? Who feeds them? What do we do with them? We never eat them. How do we kill all
*  the wild pigs? I mean, another question is what do we do with the feed, the things that we're
*  feeding the animals? If that stuff decomposes, it releases carbon into the atmosphere as well.
*  But at least when you feed it to animals, you're taking food that is inedible to humans. Like I'm
*  not going to eat soy cakes. And I think you are. Grass, fobs, corn stalks, leftover grains after
*  you make whiskey and other types of alcohol, you feed those to cattle, they upcycle that into
*  highly nutrient dense and bioavailable protein. What James said a number of times in the film was
*  cattle or animals are just the middle man. I'm like, exactly. They're really amazing middlemen.
*  They take food that is inedible to humans and turn it into super nutrient dense food that we can
*  digest and absorb. I mean, thank you. Yeah, this, I mean, it's just, it's so confusing when a film
*  like this gets made because so many people get up in arms. And so many people get influenced by it.
*  And so many people think that this is the way to go. My take on a lot of this is there's a lot of
*  people that have kind of fashioned their careers out of this ideology, whether they believe it or
*  not, you know, the thing is, like, we can go down that road of that we can say, okay, so this film
*  was made by James, James Cameron was one of the filmmakers. He also is the owner of Verdient
*  Foods, which is a pea protein company. And he said it, he has the goal of it becoming the biggest
*  organic pea protein company in the in the world. He's invested $140 million into it. His wife,
*  Suzy Cameron is finding a chain of vegan schools. And so, you know, from one perspective, that's
*  conflict of interest, you know, this, this is an agenda driven film, it's not a dispassionate,
*  objective look, you know, scientific look at the vegan diet. But, you know, I mean,
*  you can make that argument about just about anyone at this point, like, is it that surprising that a
*  vegan film has a bunch of vegan medical experts in it? Is it surprising that those experts invest
*  in what they believe in and that they write books about it? I don't think so, you know, but but it's
*  important to know that and to not confuse a film like that with a scientific work. And that's my
*  problem with this is the, what is it, the American College of Lifestyle Medicine, I have to look this
*  up. One of these organizations is offering CEUs to doctors who watch this film and complete a quiz.
*  That's absolutely ridiculous. This has not been pure, this is not peer reviewed science. This is
*  not something that doctors should be getting CEUs for. What is a CEU? Continuing education units.
*  So like, basically, doctors have to do any medical professional has to do a certain amount of
*  continuing education. You know, generally, you go to like an accredited seminar or class or whatever,
*  and that's how you do it. But they're actually offering those for people who doctors who watch
*  this film and complete a short quiz. And yeah, that's freaky. So I don't know if we talked about
*  this on the con show or one of the previous one. Yeah, it was American College of Lifestyle Medicine.
*  Well, they were founded by Seventh Day Adventists at Loma Linda University. The Seventh Day Adventist
*  Church, you know about this? They're vegetarians. Yeah. So it was one of the founders was Ellen
*  White, and she taught that meat was a toxic substance and that flesh should be avoided
*  because it increases our carnal urges. Hollow. It was a moral religious thing at first. And then
*  one of the other an early Adventist church member, Lena Cooper, she co founded the American Dietetic
*  Association, which is still to this day, one of our major dietetics organizations. And she wrote
*  textbooks that were used in dietetic and nursing programs all around the world for 30 years. So we
*  have this weird meshing that goes back to like the early 20th century between religion and science.
*  Do the Seventh Day Adventists have better health overall in general? They do. They're like one of
*  those blue zone people. But the argument is often made that that's related to diet. Well, it could
*  be that it's related to, you know, part of their creed is to eat healthy whole foods, but they're
*  also don't smoke, they don't drink, they're they're advised to exercise. So it's kind of like the Dean
*  Ornish studies where, you know, you put together all these interventions that one of which is low
*  fat diet. And then you say that the benefit was because of the low fat diet. What you're what you're
*  referring to is the study that showed that, and this is what vegans like to say that vegan diet
*  is the and Joel loves to use this one. A vegan diet is the only diet that's ever been shown
*  in a study to reverse heart disease. But what this study actually shows is these people had
*  terrible diets, they smoked and they drank. And then they put them on a vegan diet, no smoking,
*  no drinking and exercise. And what do you know, their health improved. But it's not like we have
*  a corresponding diet where they did the exact same thing and gave them an omnivorous diet
*  with like grass fed bison meat, and then showed a similar set of tests and showed a decline
*  or showed a better performance by the vegan diet. You have all of these factors that are compiled
*  together, quitting drinking, quitting smoking, quit eating shit food, eating a vegan diet,
*  stress reduction and community support, all of which we know have an impact on heart disease.
*  That is the study. So when they say that a vegan diet is the only diet that's ever been shown
*  to clinically reduce heart disease, that's not really true.
*  Disingenuous. And the other thing about that study is that in the baseline characteristics
*  of the control group versus the experimental group were totally different. The experimental group
*  weighed 34 pounds more than the control group. So they had more overweight, more weight to lose.
*  Right. They were less healthy.
*  I mean, that study would be thrown out today. This was 1998.
*  Yeah. Well, this was the problem when conversing with Joel about this. And by the way, the reason
*  why I had him on, and I know people think I'm biased and I am, I'm biased. My perspective is
*  that you're correct. And then all these other, you know, Mark Sisson and Rob Wolf and all these
*  other folks, I think they're correct. I'm never as dire as a way to go. But I had him on to try to
*  pursue this path of objectivity, to try to give him an opportunity to express what's incorrect
*  about what you're saying. And it didn't work out for him. And I mean, by everybody's account that
*  I saw that he lost that debate. So you, I mean, you brought up a point, which I think is the crux of
*  this whole thing, which is context is everything. And the problem with a lot of the research on
*  plant-based diets and, you know, low-fat diets and all this is they make the implicit assumption
*  that a diet that includes meat that is like where the context is KFC, McDonald's, you know, cheese
*  doodles, Coca-Cola, the whole standard American diet is the same as a diet that includes meat
*  that's completely whole foods based, you know, like the way you eat, the way I eat, you know,
*  lots of vegetables, fresh, you know, nuts, seeds, starchy tubers, whatever.
*  Obvious. If you ask a hundred people on the street, my guess is a hundred percent would say those are
*  obviously different. But the way that research treats them is they're the same.
*  Exactly the same. Because the correlating factor, the main factor is meat.
*  Yeah. They don't control for any of those other things.
*  It's ridiculous.
*  Now that's changing. So there have been studies that have been done over the past few years that
*  are looking more at diet quality rather than just the quantity of specific food ingredients or foods
*  like meat. And what those studies are universally saying is that quality is what makes the difference.
*  Yes.
*  So a great example, we talked about this with Joel, are the studies on looking at omnivorous versus
*  vegetarian and vegan diets and lifespan. But instead of just looking at the general population
*  that eats meat, they tried to find ways to like, at least choose a slightly healthier omnivorous
*  population. So there was one, the health food shoppers study where they only looked at people
*  who shopped at health food stores thinking, okay, these people are at least thinking about it a
*  little bit. You know, it's still not controlling for all the factors, but they're saying, let's
*  look at people who shop at a place like Whole Foods and then let's compare lifespan between
*  vegetarians and vegans and omnivores. Well, guess what? Both groups live a lot longer than
*  the general population, but there was no difference in lifespan between people who ate meat and
*  vegetarians and vegans.
*  The premise is that meat is poison. And so when you add meat to these studies, that people with
*  meat are going, well, they're eating poison. And the people without meat, look, no poison. I mean,
*  what about all the other shit? This is what's so crazy about it. Like, how can you have a study
*  where you don't take into account how many people drink or smoke and you just add the meat?
*  It's insanity.
*  Yeah. That's the healthy user bias. And this is the problem. And what makes my job so difficult
*  is like, people have heard that meat is bad for 50, what, 60 years, you know? So someone can say
*  meat is bad. That's three words. And for me to unpack that, I have to talk about healthy user
*  bias. I have to talk about problems with data collection and food frequency questionnaires.
*  I have to talk about relative versus absolute risk. I mean, people are just like, what?
*  Well, that's the problem with any of this data. And it's one of the beautiful things about
*  being able to talk about it on a podcast with a moron like me is at least you're getting a
*  conversation where people are going to ask questions like, what the fuck is he saying?
*  So I get to ask you that and then people get to hear it. It's, you know, this is a very strange
*  time when it comes to information because so much of it is available, but almost too much.
*  And then when you realize when you start trying to study nutrition, there is so much to learn.
*  There's so many factors and there's so many biases.
*  Like I listened to your interview with Matt Tybee and, you know, the point I was thinking
*  about it because you were talking about it politically, how we're just living in echo
*  chambers now. So you go on social media, you're Republican, you're only going to see stuff
*  about that that caters to your view. And the algorithms are even optimized for that because
*  they know that you'll click on that more and that will lead to more ad dollars.
*  But it's similar with nutrition. So, you know, if you're vegan, you go on YouTube,
*  you're going to see ton of vegan videos and vegan perspective, same with your Facebook feed, etc.
*  And to be fair, it's the same for people who are into keto or low carb or carnivore or whatever
*  they're into. It's the same thing. So you're just getting this reinforcing confirmation bias,
*  supporting access to information.
*  That is a weird thing about social media algorithms, whether it's YouTube algorithms
*  or Facebook or any of these things, is that they're giving you what you want to see,
*  which you would say, oh great, well, that's what I want to see. But the problem is like,
*  there's so many counter arguments, especially when you're talking about nutrition science,
*  there's so many discussions on both sides of the fence, and it seems like both sides are preaching
*  to the choir.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah. Well, you know, I mean, we're biased, as you said. My story is a lot of people
*  know is I was vegan. And so, if I'm not wrong.
*  Somebody said on one of your videos, you are the most vegan sounding non-vegan ever.
*  David Linde Well, I mean, yeah, I was a vegan, I was vegetarian, I was raw food vegan, I was
*  macrobiotic vegan. I have a lot of friends who are vegan. I have patients that are vegan. I have
*  nothing against vegans. And I totally get the reasons that people become vegan. But I, like
*  many others and my patients in my community, my health was harmed by that. And now, I mean-
*  Pete Slauson How was your health harmed? Can you explain to people?
*  David Linde Yeah, I mean, I lost weight. And as you can see, I don't have a lot to lose to begin
*  with. My digestion got really screwed up. I got depressed. I'd never been depressed. Like, I've
*  never been a person who gets depressed. I felt anxious. I, you know, it just was clearly not
*  working for me. And again, that's not to say it can't work for some people.
*  Pete Slauson Do you think the cause of depression had something to do with the diet because of the
*  lack of cholesterol? It's-
*  David Linde B12.
*  Pete Slauson Hormones.
*  David Linde Iron. Yeah, for sure. But you know, now, like, I mean, it's funny too. I don't actually,
*  I make a point of not reading comments usually. But occasionally, I come across them on Twitter.
*  Pete Slauson This is something a comedian told me.
*  So, that's why I thought it was hilarious.
*  David Linde So, you know, people are like, oh, he's such a, you know, he's going to get on there
*  and just low carb, low carb. That's told, like, I'm not a low carb guy. I never have been. In fact,
*  I'm in trouble with the low carb community because, you know, I push back. I don't think
*  it's right for everybody.
*  Pete Slauson I don't think it's right for performance.
*  David Linde Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson I don't see any evidence that for elite athletic performers, that it's the way to
*  go. And I don't know anyone that's an elite athletic performer that follows those diets.
*  David Linde Maybe endurance runners.
*  Pete Slauson I was going to say Zach.
*  David Linde Zach Bitter.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, I was going to say Zach. And Zach flies in the face of all this stuff. And,
*  you know, if you want to include someone like that guy that ran the Appalachian Trail in
*  48 days or whatever he did. Yeah, I mean, which is no small feat for sure. But I mean, Zach Bitter
*  ran 20, he ran a 100 mile race in 11 hours and 40 minutes, which is 40 something minutes,
*  which is fucking bananas.
*  David Linde And then he kept running, I think, after that.
*  Pete Slauson He's a savage. All he eats, he eats rib eyes.
*  David Linde Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson That's what that guy eats. I mean, he talked about the main food in his diet is rib eye
*  steaks. David Linde
*  He's mostly keto. So yeah, I mean, anyways, my point was just like, I'm not super dogmatic. I'm
*  just like, I'm interested in what works for the most people, essentially. And, you know, you
*  mentioned Scott Jurek, a Belgian dentist shattered his record by five days a couple years ago. And
*  that guy was eating like Snickers and tons of crap. So I'm not saying that –
*  Pete Slauson He shattered his record by five days?
*  David Linde Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, Jesus.
*  David Linde I'm not saying that that's what you should do, but I'm saying there's more athletic
*  performance than food.
*  Pete Slauson I guess that's not really deceptive because he did break the record. When he broke
*  it, he did break it.
*  David Linde Yeah, he broke it. He's a phenomenal athlete.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  David Linde I don't want to take that away from him.
*  Pete Slauson Again.
*  David Linde And then like Michael Phelps, you know –
*  Pete Slauson Guy eats pizza.
*  David Linde Guy eats 12,000 calories of like sugar, French toast, pizza. Usain Bolt in the
*  Beijing Olympics when he shattered those records, he ate over a thousand chicken nuggets, I think
*  somebody calculated it. So, you know, there's more to it than diet.
*  Pete Slauson I think when you're at that level of performance,
*  you are burning off such an insane amount of calories and you're working so hard.
*  David Linde Almost doesn't matter.
*  Pete Slauson You can kind of almost eat anything.
*  David Linde When you're in that mode, for sure.
*  Pete Slauson This is obviously not comparable, but when we did Sober October last year,
*  we had this fitness challenge. I was doing cardio, no joke, minimum five hours a day,
*  sometimes six and seven. It was insane. And I was eating everything, boxes of cookies,
*  bottles of soda.
*  David Linde Probably lost weight, too.
*  Pete Slauson Well, not really, because I lifted a lot of
*  weights, too. I kind of maintained, maybe I lost a couple of pounds, but I was drinking like giant
*  cokes. I was drinking like a cream soda. I never drank that shit. But it's like my body wanted
*  sugar. It's like, give me some sugar. You just did seven hours on a fucking elliptical machine,
*  you asshole. It was so ridiculous. But those guys are working out even harder than that. So imagine
*  like what Phelps…
*  David Linde If you need 12,000 calories, you're not getting
*  it with paleo and you're not getting it with a vegan diet.
*  Pete Slauson That's important.
*  David Linde So let's rewind a little bit to the protein,
*  the RDA. That's super important. So 0.8 kilograms per kilogram of protein per day is the RDA. And
*  again, that's just the basic minimum. That's not the amount that's needed for optimal health and
*  performance. That's just the absolute basics for avoiding malnutrition. However, even that number
*  now, that's based on outdated nitrogen balance studies for determining the RDA. And there's a
*  newer method called the indicator amino acid oxidation technique or IAAO. And this suggests
*  that the RDA should be 1.2 grams per kilogram. And again, just the basic minimum, bare minimum,
*  not optimal. So it's now gone up from 0.8 to 1.2. And if you use that number, if you pull up slide
*  eight, Jamie, that's only enough for an adult that weighs less than 130 pounds.
*  Pete Slauson Really?
*  David Linde So, sorry. You know how he said, James said in the study, the average vegetarian
*  gets 71 grams a day, which is not only the RDA, but 70% more. That's using the 0.8 number. But
*  if you use 1.2 grams per kilogram per day, then a lot of people are going to be protein deficient
*  on a vegetarian diet. And we're not, again, not talking about optimal amount for athletes.
*  We're just talking about the RDA basic bare minimum.
*  Pete Slauson And when you say vegetarian, you should say vegan, correct? Because you're not
*  talking about egg protein. You can get…
*  David Linde No, this study was vegetarian. They weren't referring to vegans.
*  Pete Slauson So, you actually could get egg protein.
*  David Linde Yeah, and dairy protein.
*  Pete Slauson Eggs are far superior in terms of their amino acid profile than vegetables.
*  David Linde So, for vegans, it would be different.
*  Pete Slauson I brought up eggs to a friend of mine. I was saying this really recently,
*  why don't you try eggs? And they looked at me like I was talking to them about poison.
*  David Linde Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson Like, there's plenty of people that are vegan or vegetarian,
*  and you bring up eggs to them, and they look at you like, why would I eat an egg?
*  David Linde Yeah. So, that's, you know, 1.2 is the RDA
*  with if you use this newer method. But for athletes, James, to his credit, does acknowledge in the
*  film that athletes need more protein than regular non-athlete people. But he doesn't say how much
*  more. So, again, if you use these IAAO method, they've done, they use this newer technique to
*  look at athletes, and they found that the range is somewhere between 1.4 to 2.7 grams per kilogram.
*  So, we're now way higher than that 0.8 number. And just for people who aren't familiar with
*  kilograms, let's say we take the median number there, 2.1 grams per kilogram per day. Well,
*  anyone who's ever been in the bodybuilding weightlifting community will recognize this.
*  That's one pound of protein per pound of bodyweight a day, which has been the common
*  recommendation in that community for a long-
*  Pete O'Reilly I mean one gram of protein.
*  David Linde Sorry, one gram of protein.
*  Pete O'Reilly Not one pound.
*  David Linde No, that's a lot.
*  Pete O'Reilly Holy shit.
*  David Linde No, that's a lot.
*  David Linde No, that's a lot.
*  Pete O'Reilly No, that's a lot.
*  David Linde No, that's a lot.
*  David Linde Can you imagine?
*  David Linde One gram, and in fact, even Arnold in the movie says,
*  I weighed 250 pounds, I used to eat 250 grams of protein.
*  Pete O'Reilly Yeah.
*  David Linde You know, like that's the recommendation.
*  And it turns out that's actually based on science, you know. So, a 200 pound athlete
*  would need 200 grams of protein a day. And Jamie, if you pull up slide 10, this is what you'd have
*  to eat on a vegan diet to get that amount of protein. And again, we're just talking about
*  quantity, we're not talking about quality.
*  Pete O'Reilly So, 200 pound athlete, that's me. I weigh 200 pounds.
*  David Linde 200 pound athlete, so you would need to eat-
*  Pete O'Reilly Show me what I'd have to eat.
*  David Linde Three cups of cooked lentils, three cups of
*  chickpeas, two cups of quinoa, three ounces of almonds, three slices of silk and tofu,
*  and 10 tablespoons of peanut butter.
*  Pete O'Reilly That's the whole day?
*  David Linde That's the day.
*  Pete O'Reilly I could fuck that up in a day.
*  David Linde Yeah, you could. But the problem is, the
*  dia score for all of those, like the bioavailability and amino acid profile would be
*  horrible compared to meat, eggs, dairy.
*  Pete O'Reilly So, what would I have to do? Because I know
*  they've done this study. There's a study that I'd read, or had heard about, I should say,
*  where they compared rice protein to whey protein, and they found that at a certain level of grams,
*  like whatever it was, they had an equal effect. Is it lutein?
*  David Linde Leucine.
*  Pete O'Reilly Leucine.
*  David Linde The muscle protein synthesis.
*  Pete O'Reilly They had an equal effect. I should give credit to the video that I was watching.
*  This gentleman, I was watching his video today, Dr. Ryan Lowry. And they were saying that what
*  that means is that, correct me if I'm wrong, what it is is, once you hit a certain level of leucine,
*  it's a point of diminishing returns and there's no added benefit to having more leucine in your
*  diet. So, if you hit whatever it is, I think it was 48 grams or something like that. When you have
*  48 grams of this and 48 grams of that, you put the two of them together, it's essentially the same
*  effect.
*  David Linde Leucine
*  Well, I'm not sure about that, but I mean, leucine is very important for anabolic signaling and
*  muscle protein synthesis. It's the essential amino acid that's thought to be the most important for
*  that, and it's low in plant proteins. And the other issue with plant proteins that you have
*  is that they have limiting amino acids. So, these are amino acids that actually interfere with
*  muscle protein synthesis because the levels are so low in that food. So, lysine is a limiting
*  amino acid in grains like wheat and rice. Maybe there was leucine and lysine discussion maybe there.
*  Dr. Ryan Lowry
*  Maybe.
*  David Linde
*  And then methionine and cysteine are limiting in legumes like soy. So, Jamie, slide six,
*  I made a chart comparing the amino acid profile in beef to several different plant proteins like
*  white beans, soybeans, peas, and rice. What you can see there is beef is higher in every single
*  amino acid other than every plant protein that's compared there with the exception of
*  soybeans are slightly higher in tryptophan than beef. Look at leucine. So, beef, it's 2.23 versus
*  0.58 for white beans, 1.3 for soy. Soy is higher in leucine than any other plant protein, which is
*  why it's often used. And then like 0.3 for peas and 0.01 for rice.
*  Dr. Ryan Lowry
*  If you get to a certain number or a certain level of all these, so if you ate enough food
*  that you would pass a certain marker, would it be possible to have the same effect by eating
*  cooked peas or soybeans as it would?
*  Jamie Boucher It is possible, for sure. So, I agree with that. You have to eat an enormous amount of that,
*  as you can see, because of the levels. And this is why a lot of vegan bodybuilders and athletes end
*  up using protein powders, because you can get to those amounts easier by using the powders. And you
*  can also blend like 70% pea with 30% rice to get the right amino acid ratio easier with powders.
*  So, like Patrick Babumian is a good example of that. Did you see the video that Bobby Geist made?
*  Dr. Ryan Lowry No.
*  Jamie Boucher So, there's actually a video-
*  Dr. Ryan Lowry Oh, is that the one that you sent me?
*  Dr. Ryan Lowry Yes, I did see that.
*  Jamie Boucher There's a video that Patrick made himself of his own diet.
*  Dr. Ryan Lowry Yes.
*  Jamie Boucher On what he eats on a daily basis. And it turns out to be a boatload of protein powder
*  and just shakes with all kinds of powders and supplements and things like that. So,
*  yeah, we can go through it. So, he starts with a bunch of different supplements in the morning,
*  multivitamin, nutritional yeast, zinc, glucosamine, magnesium, calcium, B12 and iron.
*  Then he has a protein shake with soy protein powder, creatine and beta-alanine, which probably
*  is because he's aware of the research showing lower levels of muscle creatine and carnosine
*  in vegans. Beta-alanine and creatine would address that. Then he has a post-workout smoothie with
*  soy or pea protein powder, glutamine, beta-alanine, creatine and dried greens. Then his first solid
*  meal of the day is fried falafel, french fries, soy sausage, fried peppers and tomatoes. Then
*  he has some more protein shakes and smoothies throughout the day. So,
*  I don't know, that doesn't strike me as a super healthy way to eat.
*  Dr. Ryan Lowry What problem do you have with that?
*  Well, first of all, I think we should primarily get nutrients from food whenever we can. I'm
*  not against supplementation. I think there's a role for it, of course, especially with things
*  like vitamin D that you might not be able to get enough of from food or therapeutic
*  supplementation if you're dealing with a health problem. But eating a diet that is not sufficient
*  in the amount of nutrients that you need and then using supplements to address that doesn't
*  make a lot of sense to me. Dr. Ryan Lowry
*  Well, in his situation, he's got a very unique situation that he's a strength athlete. That's
*  all he's doing is trying to lift really, really heavy things. So, he needs to maintain a certain
*  amount of bulk. Dr. Ryan Lowry
*  He needs to have an enormous amount of protein. Dr. Ryan Lowry
*  Yeah, an enormous amount of protein has to be, and he's very heavy, you know, and that sport is also,
*  that's a steroid sport. I mean, it's just one of those sports where it's like bodybuilding.
*  Dr. Ryan Lowry Pretty much everybody.
*  Dr. Ryan Lowry It's a steroid sport. So, you're eating massive amounts of quantities,
*  you're taking chemicals. Yeah, it might not be the healthiest thing. But it's also like just that the
*  sport itself might not be the healthiest thing. I mean, you've seen them carry people on the,
*  he was doing that in the film. That's not good for your back. That's fucking crazy. But it works
*  for what he's trying to do. Obviously, it's working for what he's trying to do. There's no
*  dispute in that. See, what he's doing is almost like the intelligent way, if you want to be vegan
*  and do what he's trying to do. I don't know if he could eat just vegetables and pull that off.
*  Dr. Ryan Lowry He couldn't. But that's kind of the point.
*  There are a lot of other strongmen that do. Dr. Ryan Lowry
*  Like Robert Oberst. Dr. Ryan Lowry
*  That you had on the show. Dr. Ryan Lowry
*  Yeah, he just eats meat and rice. I mean, that guy eats pounds and pounds of beef and rice.
*  Dr. Ryan Lowry Simple, you know,
*  accessible form of carbohydrate and a lot of protein.
*  And it's an unfair comparison. And Oberst talked about him on the podcast before. They're much,
*  he's much larger. Dr. Ryan Lowry
*  A lot of the strongmen are huge. Like the guy who played Gregor in Game of Thrones, right?
*  Dr. Ryan Lowry Yes, he's one of them.
*  Dr. Ryan Lowry He's like six, eight or nine.
*  Dr. Ryan Lowry Yeah, he's enormous.
*  Dr. Ryan Lowry And Patrick is not. He's not nearly that size.
*  Dr. Ryan Lowry Five, six or five, seven or something.
*  Dr. Ryan Lowry So the comparison between him and a guy like Oberst in those legit
*  top of the food chain strongest man in the world competitions, it's not comparable.
*  Dr. Ryan Lowry Totally different weight class.
*  Dr. Ryan Lowry Robert is enormous. He's so much bigger.
*  Dr. Ryan Lowry Yeah.
*  Dr. Ryan Lowry But the problem is, in the film,
*  they don't make that distinction. And they try to pretend that this guy is one of the strongest men
*  in the world. He's not. He's very strong, no doubt. And he definitely has broken some records and some
*  competitions and have different weight classes and different. But you're not talking about a
*  guy who wins those Magnus von Magnusen competitions where they're carrying trucks and shit.
*  Dr. Ryan Lowry Well, I guess my point too was, is it the best example of how an athlete can thrive
*  on a plant-based whole foods diet? Dr. Ryan Lowry
*  Well, I think it is, though. Because for him, for his size, to be a guy who's five foot seven and
*  is carrying that fucking enormous amount of weight, he's obviously doing something that's
*  very impressive. And he's doing it while he's on this vegan diet. And again, I mean, just
*  discounting all the illegal supplementation, because I don't think it is illegal in that sport.
*  You kind of have to do it. You want to get that big. But if you want to do it and do it as a vegan,
*  he is showing you that it's possible. So in that sense, I defend what he's doing. Because I think
*  that's the only way in that. But this is a very sport-specific area of performance. He's just
*  talking about lifting insanely heavy shit. And he's doing that and thriving on a vegan diet.
*  Dr. Ryan Lowry Yeah, no doubt,
*  enormously strong. And he's succeeding. I would argue that he might do even better if he was
*  eating more nutrient-dense food. And he might need to take fewer supplements and drink less powder.
*  Yeah, but I think from his perspective, that's my bias. I'm more like a whole foods person.
*  And that's where I'm coming from.
*  Kyle Smedley Another problem that I had in the film,
*  especially in relations to sport, is the Nate Diaz-Conor McGregor comparison. First of all,
*  Nate Diaz is not a vegan. Nate Diaz eats fish and he eats eggs. And he does try to follow a whole
*  food vegan diet, I think during camp. So I would have to talk to him about that. I know he's done
*  interviews talking about that, but I've definitely seen him eat fish. I watched him on the Anthony
*  Bourdain's television show and he was eating fish. I know he's eaten eggs. He doesn't eat land animals.
*  I think what he does is avoid red meat.
*  Dr. Ryan Lowry Well, fish and eggs take care of it.
*  Kyle Smedley Yes.
*  Dr. Ryan Lowry Because fish is actually higher often than meat in terms of protein, ounce for
*  ounce. It's also very high in collagen, which is super important for recovery and repair.
*  And explains lack of collagen probably explains why a lot of vegan athletes get injured,
*  which we can talk about more later. And then eggs, as you know, are super, you know, they're really
*  high on the Diaz score scale. They're bioavailable, lots of other nutrients. So
*  Kyle Smedley Here's another problem with that whole
*  comparison. First of all, Nate Diaz is a fantastic fighter. He's a long time mixed martial arts
*  veteran. He's outstanding in all areas. He has a fantastic submission game. His brother,
*  Nick Diaz, is one of the best in the world. He's also outstanding and all. And his brother, Nick,
*  I believe is vegan. He's probably a better example because, you know, even though Nick hasn't
*  beaten like some of the top flight fighters in a few years, back when he was in Strike Force,
*  he was top of the food chain. I mean, he's he's an elite fighter for sure. I'm not sure if he was
*  vegan back then. I'd have to ask him. But the point being that Nate is a exceptional,
*  exceptionally skilled athlete. And he was coming into that fight on extremely short notice. So he
*  was most likely following his off camp diet, which is eggs and eating fish and things along
*  those lines. And I think he said he was partying in Mexico. So who knows what the fuck he was
*  doing? It was like 11 days out, they call him and they set up this fight. I forget how many days out
*  it was, but it was very, very short amount of time. Connor was preparing for a 155 pound fight
*  against Rafael dos Anjos. So he was reducing his caloric intake, dropping his weight down to try
*  to make this 155 pound weight class. It's a big cut for him. So when he when you do that, you
*  you are in anticipation that the person you're fighting is also doing that. So you both kind
*  of agree that you're going to be in a certain weakened state when you actually weigh in at 155
*  pounds. So like two weight classes below his normal? Well, let me let me keep going. So he's
*  this is that was the first and only time well, except the rematch with Nate was the only time
*  that he's fought at 170. So they made a decision to fight at 170 instead of 155 because Nate
*  did not have time to reduce his calories and cut the weight and it takes a long time. It's a slow
*  process of Nate is a big fella. He walks around probably over 200 pounds easy and he drops weight
*  and he didn't want to drop that much weight. He's a big guy, man. He's big and long. And Connor was
*  dropping his weight down to 155. So he's 10 days out and he just starts packing on food,
*  eating as much food as he can. Not only that, but stylistically, Nate's a nightmare for him.
*  Nate has a fucking evil submission game. He's tough as nails. His endurance is always fantastic
*  because off season, he's always doing triathlons and he's always doing like endurance sports.
*  I mean, he's in phenomenal shape and his jujitsu is like many levels better than Connor's. I mean,
*  he's a legit top of the food chain MMA black belt in jujitsu. So they have this fight.
*  Connor gets tired. Nate beats him up, gets him on the ground, submits him. And they're saying this
*  is a victory for veganism. What they don't say is five months later, they fought and Connor beat him.
*  They fought again. This time they had a full training camp. Connor prepared and it was a very
*  close fight, I should say. You could have scored it either way. I mean, it was a really close fight.
*  Razor's thin. But the fact remains, Connor beat him in the rematch. So then they leave this out
*  of the narrative like, oh my God, the vegans are dominating. Look, vegan dominated. But this is a
*  last minute fight. Connor goes up and Nate Diaz steps in and takes care of business and wins the
*  fight. It speaks more to how good Nate Diaz is than a vegan diet. And it doesn't take into account
*  that four months later or five months later, whatever it was, he loses. And he's not vegan.
*  I mean, there are a few other examples like that in the film where you catch a certain
*  window of it, but they don't show what happens afterwards. We talked about the vegan honeymoon.
*  So Brian Jennings, the boxer, they talked about he went vegan in end of 2013. He was 17 and oh
*  before he was vegan. And he's been so he's seven and four after that. So you can't say that that's
*  because he transitioned to a vegan diet, but you can't also say nor nor can you say that veganism
*  improved his performance. Objectively, he's gotten worse since then.
*  Well, the argument against that would be that he's moving up into the upper echelons of the
*  heavyweight division and it's filled with killers like any combat sport. And that as he got in,
*  many fighters don't make it to get in. And he lost to wasn't one of the Klitschko's. Yes,
*  I think he lost to Vladimir. I think he lost to Vladimir Klitschko in a decision and he
*  he handled himself very well. It was a very good fight for him. He looked real good.
*  But yeah, I mean that that upper loan you get to these Andrew Ruiz,
*  Deontay Wilder, I mean killers. Yeah, it's like not most people that get up into that division.
*  They start losing. He's a good example too of this principle of context being everything.
*  Because he said in the film, my early years growing up in Philly, the only thing we knew
*  was spinach in a can collard greens and Popeyes KFC everybody frying chicken. I grew up not even
*  knowing about half these other vegetables asparagus to me just came out like five years ago.
*  So, you know, again, again, honeymoon. Yeah, going from like a crappy standard American diet
*  to a whole foods diet. I don't doubt that someone's going to feel better. But what do you
*  felt better? Like you said, eating some grass fed bison and some broccoli along with all of
*  those plants. That's the question. Yes, that is the question. And this is the real purpose,
*  my real purpose for getting involved in these fucking discussions over and over and over again.
*  I want people to understand that this there's nuance to this. Yeah, there's and there's also
*  biological variability. There's some people that are they can get along on certain diets easier.
*  There's some people that have a horrible time with seafood. There's some people that have a
*  horrible time with certain grains. I mean, this is we are all different. We come from an enormous
*  planet where your ancestors developed and your genes developed in different parts of the world.
*  We're all different. But but what we know about nutrition, it is so important that we are honest
*  about what we know. This is what the problem I have with a lot of these documentaries, they're
*  not honest about what they know. They're only giving you little snippets and cherry picking data
*  and doing things like the study that showed that the vegan diet can clinically reverse heart
*  disease. These you're using all this deception, pretending that the gladiators chose to eat gruel,
*  like this is how we're going to kick ass, we're just gonna eat barley, the fuck out of here.
*  This is nonsense. And they know it's nonsense. Either they know it's nonsense, or they just fucking
*  slap some blinders on their head and just plow straight ahead and ignore anything that conflicts
*  with any of these thoughts that they're expressing. I mean, there's there's so many examples of this
*  in the film. One was this lettuce has more antioxidants than salmon or eggs.
*  Well, so what? I mean, we're not we're not saying don't eat lettuce, right? I mean, I've, I'm always
*  I've always argued that the optimal diet includes both plants and animal foods. And there's reasons
*  for that plants contain some nutrients that animal foods don't and animal foods can contain nutrients
*  that plants don't. So very consistent about this. Both of them. An orange has more vital
*  vitamin C than a beef steak. Right. That's just how it goes. But we could just easily say a serving
*  of salmon has 716 times more selenium than lettuce and provides 100% of the RDA of B12 where lettuce
*  provides 0%. But I'm not going to say that because that's ridiculous. I'm not trying to get people
*  not to eat lettuce. Exactly. You're not on team. Well, and there's another thing that's going on
*  right now. These carnivore folks, which I find fascinating because they are as ideologically
*  driven as vegans. We have the anti vegans. It's like we have Antifa and then we have the alt-right.
*  Now we have the carnivores and we have the vegans and both of them dig their fucking heels in the
*  sand. And both of them are committed to thinking that their side is the only way to go. And
*  Rhonda Patrick has talked about this many, many times when people start discussing negative aspects
*  of eating foods, particularly plants, because of stressors. And she's like, no, there's actually
*  an effect where your body's reacting to them that's beneficial. Much like when you get in a sauna,
*  your body reacts to the heat. It's actually beneficial for your health. That's how exercise
*  works. You lift a weight until you can't lift it anymore. Your muscle tissue breaks down and
*  it rebuilds stronger the next time. So these folks that are talking about don't eat vegetables,
*  because vegetables give you these things that are bad for your body. Like, okay, are you sure?
*  I mean, there's a lot of work to be done here, folks. There's a lot of fucking research to be
*  read into. And there's a lot of conversations you have to have with people far more educated
*  than you in the subjects. I think often as humans, we have a hard time differentiating between like
*  our own experience and what works for us and then larger, bigger picture. So take someone who has a
*  severe autoimmune disease. They go on carnivore, their symptoms disappear. That's pretty compelling.
*  Very compelling.
*  It's really understandable why they would be passionate about that and why they would want to
*  continue that approach. But again, like I said before, we're not always choosing between one
*  great alternative and one terrible alternative.
*  It is interesting to me though, that one thing that we have been lied to about is that you need
*  vegetables. Because you don't need it. Just much like with the RDA, you need a certain amount to
*  not starve to death. You don't necessarily need vegetables. There's a whole community of people
*  out there that's thriving and not eating a single piece of vegetable. It's really interesting.
*  Yeah. The problem is we just don't know what happens long term there.
*  Well, I got my eye on Sean Baker.
*  I'm not saying, and look, I want to be clear. It might be fine.
*  It seems like it is.
*  I don't know. I'm just saying we don't know. So you're introducing an element of uncertainty
*  because if you look at it from an anthropological perspective, every group of people we've ever
*  studied in human history has eaten both plants and animals in different proportions.
*  What about the Comanches? One of the things I was reading about the Comanches or was
*  watching, listening rather to this audio book, what is it called?
*  The Empire of the Summer Moon. It's amazing. I'm recommending too much. I've got to shut the
*  fuck up about it. But one of the things they talk about is that the Comanches ate very little
*  berries or fruits or vegetables. They mostly just ate buffalo.
*  Well, the Inuit also ate very little, especially during the winter. But they went to great lengths
*  to trade for plant foods. And in the summer, they eat more plant foods. So the proportions vary.
*  Maasai, for example, milk, meat, blood, and some plant foods. But then you have other groups that
*  ate more plant foods. There was a study, ethnographic study of hunter-gatherer cultures
*  done, 230 roughly study culture study. And they found that on average,
*  hunter-gatherers got about 70% of their calories from animal foods and about 30% from plant food.
*  So that's percent of calorie. That's not looking at a plate because animal foods are more
*  calorie dense. So it still might be two thirds of the plate is plants and one third is animal
*  foods if they use plates. But that's the rough percentage. But it would vary from place to place.
*  We don't know of any group that exclusively and by choice, not from living in a marginal environment
*  like the Arctic, but by choice, ate only animal foods for a long period of time. And a lot of the
*  research that we have, the clinical research suggests that plants have some useful nutrients,
*  especially some fibers that can feed the beneficial gut bacteria. There are studies showing that
*  extremely low carb diets can have some maybe not great effects on the gut flora. So again,
*  it could be fine, but we just don't know. And so you're adding an element of uncertainty there.
*  That's all I'm saying. So there could be a carnivore honeymoon, as it were, just like
*  you're talking about the vegan honeymoon and that there could. So your contention, and this is my
*  belief as well, is that most human beings fare better on an omnivorous diet. With both plants
*  and animal. And what proportion of plants and animal foods will depend on all the factors
*  that you mentioned, genes, epigenetics, health status, geography, whatever else is going on.
*  And for some people, that might just be a small amount of animal foods. It might be Nate Diaz,
*  some fish and some eggs, and then the rest, plant-based diet. For other people,
*  it might be a lot more animal foods. That's where I think the individual variation comes in.
*  Right. And I'm sure most of these athletes that are following a vegan diet, like you were talking
*  about earlier with Patrick, they're taking protein powders. So they're allowing themselves to get a
*  large dose of protein to fill their requirements simply and easily in a shake form, rather than
*  having to wolf down four or five bowls of some vegetable. And if they're not, they're probably
*  not doing that well. So we have all these stories of NFL and NBA athletes that went vegan and then
*  stopped because they were not able to maintain their weight or they got injured and they weren't
*  able to recover. In the show notes for this, I have many, many examples of pretty high level
*  NBA and NFL athletes that have to. Cam Newton is one of them, right?
*  Cam Newton is the most recent one. So he went vegan in February, he had the worst season of his
*  career. He had minus two yards on five carries in the first two games and he rushed for more than
*  30 yards, 33 yards a game only once in his last nine starts. How Cam Newton's vegan diet may be
*  hurting Panthers quarterback play and injury recovery. What is this on? What website is this?
*  This is his notes. Oh, it's your notes, but it's from a website.
*  It's from a website. Yeah. There's references. And then he developed a Liz Frank injury in his foot.
*  That's a broken foot, right? It's broken foot and really hard to recover from. And some people think,
*  certainly could be career ending. I mean, if you lose 10, 20 pounds, that's a big deal for
*  a high level athlete because the studies have shown that that can interfere with muscle protein
*  synthesis. It can also increase inflammation and make recovery more difficult. But the other thing
*  is if they're not eating the protein powders, they're not taking collagen, for example,
*  of a vegan source of collagen. Collagen is critical for muscle recovery and repair. And it's hard to,
*  you know, you can make some collagen, but I think a lot of people on a plant-based diet,
*  if they're high level athletes and they're not really getting collagen coming in,
*  it's going to be difficult. When Travis Barker was in a plane crash, he was like severely burned
*  and they were having a hard time getting him to heal. And he started eating meat in order to
*  heal because he's a vegan. He owns what's it called? Crossroads in a really amazing vegan
*  restaurant in LA. And he talked about on the podcast, he was just wolfing down beef jerky,
*  just trying to eat meat in order to get his body to heal. That couldn't have gone over well
*  with the vegan. Well, I mean, he was just being honest. I mean, Travis is super, super honest.
*  He's just saying like, but he chooses to not eat meat other than that. He just did it to recover.
*  And then once he recovered, he went back to his normal vegan diet. So you have
*  Djokovic, who's best tennis player of all time. Probably he, when he first went dairy free and
*  gluten free, he would, you know, was number one in the world. He went vegan, ranking dropped to 22,
*  which is the lowest he'd been since he was a teenager. And then he started adding fish
*  back into his diet. And, you know, back, back up to number one, you have
*  Damien Lillard from NBA. He went vegan for five months, but then he added animal protein back to
*  slide 35. Jamie, he said, I did it, but I started to lose a little bit too much weight with all the
*  games and practices and all that. I had to balance it out. So now I've been mixing it up a little
*  more, having vegan meals and still mixing it up with other stuff. So it sounds kind of similar
*  to Nate, you know, mostly vegan, but adding some animal foods back in there. You had Tony, Tony
*  Gonzalez, hall of fame, tight end. I went vegan and three weeks later, he said, there was an article
*  about this said, it's in the show notes, the a hundred pound dumbbells he used to easily throw
*  around felt like lead weights. The article says I was scared out of my mind. Gonzalez said he had
*  lost 10 pounds. He ended up adding a small, small amounts of animal protein back to his diet.
*  You got Gerald McCoy, NFL. He said, quote, the explosiveness wasn't sustainable because I didn't
*  have that extra oomph that I needed because the lack of the type of protein I was taking in. So
*  I just added a little bit of animal protein back in my diet. And it's given me that back.
*  Now, again, we're talking about elite athletes with very specific nutritional requirements,
*  because they're asking a tremendous amount of their body. I mean, these guys could probably
*  need like 4,000 to 5,000 calories a day to function well. And of that, you know, if they weigh 250 or
*  275, they need 250 to 275 grams of protein and it should be high in leucine for muscle protein
*  synthesis and it should be bioavailable, you know, all that. And so in comparison to the average
*  person, the average person who followed their diet probably wouldn't see any detrimental effect
*  for a long time because they're not requiring their body to do these incredible things.
*  I don't know. It varies. I mean, I've had patients who went vegan and within two months,
*  they were in really dire straits and there are people who go vegan and they're fine for
*  their whole life. Hormones are a big one, right? And why is that?
*  Everything, you know, micronutrients really run the show. I mean, of course, the macronutrients,
*  protein, fat, carbohydrates are important. And as I said before, you know, if you're 200 pounds,
*  average American weight is male is 200 pounds. And so if they're in a vegetarian, they're consuming
*  the average number of grams of protein, that's less than the updated RDA. We looked at that on
*  that slide. So I would argue that even for the average person, protein could be a problem,
*  both quantity and quality. Most people are getting plenty of carbohydrates and enough fat. So that's
*  not an issue. Then it comes down to micronutrients. So think B12, you know, that's the thing that came
*  up in the film a number of times. So we should talk about that a little bit because there was some
*  actually just, you know, factually inaccurate information about B12 that I want to correct.
*  So the claim, this is slide 55, Jamie. James said B12 is not made by animals. It's made by
*  bacteria that these animals consume in the soil and water. Before industrial farming, farm animals
*  and humans could get B12 by eating traces of dirt on plant foods or by drinking water from rivers
*  or streams. But now because of pesticides and antibiotics and chlorine that killed bacteria,
*  this vitamin even farm animals-
*  That produces this vitamin.
*  Yeah, that produces this vitamin. Even farm animals have to be given B12 supplements.
*  That's just all false. That's all just factually wrong. So first of all,
*  B12 is made by bacteria, but it's, animals don't get it from consuming soil and water. The B12
*  is made by bacteria in their gut. So in ruminants like cows, in the rumen, which is a chamber in the
*  stomach, the bacteria convert cobalt that they get from grass that they eat into cobalamin, which is
*  B12. And then they are foregut fermenters. So they can absorb the B12, the bacteria produced in their
*  intestines and utilize that themselves. So primates, including humans, also have bacteria
*  that make B12, but we're hindgut fermenters. So we cannot absorb the B12 that our own gut bacteria
*  make. Well, that's not exactly true. Chimps and gorillas can, but that's only because they eat
*  their own poo. So that is one potential strategy for meeting your B12. You can be coprophagic.
*  We will find ethical poo eaters. There's a whole community now of red ethical poo eaters is now a
*  new subreddit. So, so, so we cannot get B12 from our own gut bacteria and that, and if there is
*  any B12 in soil, it's only from manure, you know, that's come from animals. There's also zero evidence
*  that B12 is fed to cattle and there's no evidence that humans have ever been able to meet their B12
*  needs from just eating soil and water. If you pull up slide 56, Jamie, Jack Norris, who's a vegan
*  dietitian, you know, we don't agree on a lot of things, but I appreciate his rigor with the science.
*  He has a big article on B12 on this website and it said, he says the suggestion that humans have
*  ever relied on uncleaned organic produce for vitamin B12 doesn't have any reliable evidence at this time.
*  So the, I just, I don't know where to go with these, that claim because it's just, it's this
*  demonstrably false even from the perspective of a vegan registered dietitian. Yes. Yeah. I don't know
*  why he said that either, but I just think that that's something he probably heard and he was
*  probably having a conversation with someone and they told him that and he just repeated it. I mean,
*  it's one of those things. Maybe one of the doctors on the, on the show brought that up. So people
*  repeat a lot of these things and then they become dogma. So here's the other thing.
*  The second part of that claim was up to 39% of people tested, including meat eaters are low on
*  B12 as a result, best way for humans to get enough B12, whether they eat animal foods or not is simply
*  to take a supplement. He didn't provide a reference for that. So I can't, it's hard to check that,
*  but again, this contradicts, you know, mounds of evidence on B12 deficiency. So there, you know,
*  there's four stages of B12 deficiency. I don't want to go too far in the weeds here, but
*  basically serum B12, which is the marker that's usually used only goes down in the fourth and
*  final stage of B12 deficiency. There are other markers that will go out of range earlier that
*  are more sensitive and detect those earlier stages. So the most sensitive markers, holo transcom
*  Alman or holo TC. So in a study in 2013, this is slide 58, Jamie, they compared B12 deficiency
*  depletion, according to holo transcom Alman levels in vegetarians, vegans, and omnivores.
*  And you can see the results here. Only 11% of omnivores had B12 depletion, 77% of vegetarians
*  and 92% of vegans. That's a pretty big difference. That's a big difference.
*  And B12 is responsible for energy. I mean, that's one of the reasons why when people are feeling
*  sick, they get a B12 shot. Well, it's also required for the myelin sheath in our nerves. B12 deficiency
*  can cause serious and even irreversible neurological damage. A lot of the harm that comes that happens
*  with kids on the vegan diet comes from B12 deficiency can decrease fluid intelligence. It can
*  cause neurological damage that's not reversible even after they start eating meat again. Maybe
*  that's what's going on with them in this information. Maybe they have legitimate neurological
*  damage. Is that possible? It's possible. There's one more if I can on it, because I'm just passionate
*  about this because it's super important. Slide 59. So homocysteine is a marker that is also more
*  sensitive than serum B12. It's a sticky inflammatory protein that's associated with heart disease and
*  dementia. So nine out of 10 comparisons that looked at B12 levels or homocysteine levels
*  in vegetarians and omnivores found higher homocysteine levels in vegans and vegetarians.
*  Higher means worse, and it means more B12 deficient. And in fact, the studies, they said,
*  the prevalence of hyperhomocysteineemia, which is high homocysteine levels reflecting low B12,
*  among vegetarians may actually be higher than among non-vegetarians already diagnosed with heart
*  disease. So this is kind of a big deal. It's like the B12 issue is serious and even folks like Jack
*  Norris, to their credit, do acknowledge it and strongly recommend that people who are on a vegan
*  diet supplement. So if people watch this film, you know, I'm glad to hear James saying that,
*  that, you know, vegetarians and vegans should supplement. I don't think omnivores need to
*  usually, but you can watch that film and get the idea that that B12, you know,
*  is maybe not that big of a deal. It's a big deal. A lot of the film was reenactments as well,
*  you know, like when James was sitting there with the knee braces on, that was not after his surgery.
*  I thought he was vegan in like 2011 or 2012 or something. When he's in the film, when they're
*  filming him, he's sitting there doing his research. Well, I don't think they filmed him while it was
*  happening back in 2012 after the injury. I mean, this is like, one of the things that I thought
*  was well done about the film was that they took someone, James, on the kind of the journey of
*  starting as an omnivore and then, you know, having this real, these realizations and turning into
*  a vegan. But the problem was that journey happened long before the film was made.
*  Exactly. So that was a little disingenuous. So that's why I'm saying he's sitting there
*  with those knee braces on and he's going over his research and just happened to have a camera crew
*  there while he's learning how to heal himself. And I'm like, Hey man, I know what you're doing.
*  I don't know. I mean, that's a narrative device. It's good filmmaking.
*  Even the rope thing, even the rope thing. I mean, I'm watching him do the rope thing at the end,
*  like, Ooh, boy, I'm done. You just did an hour. Bro, if you did an hour, you'd be fucking drenched
*  with sweat and you'd be exhausted. You wouldn't, they sprayed you or something. Like, but this is
*  fine. I believe he really did that. I don't believe he's a liar, but like,
*  yeah, I mean, he, like you said, he's clearly an amazing athlete and ripped and, you know,
*  super capable. And this was a, you know, an agenda driven film. It was meant to persuade
*  and convince people. Well, that's why it's weird because that's clearly acting.
*  You're recreating these moments, but it's billed as a, it's, it's marketed as a documentary.
*  Cause he's talking about it having just happened right after he switched over to a vegan diet,
*  all of a sudden he could do an hour on the battle ropes and then they're filming them.
*  Yeah. I'm like, come on, man, there's no fucking camera crew with that happen. You're redoing this.
*  Yeah. You think, I mean, I get it. This is how you show the footage. You put it out there and it
*  makes it like a little bit better for people to swallow and get, you know, and I liked the scenes
*  of him doing the self-defense demonstrations. Cause you get to see he truly is a fantastic
*  martial artist. He really doesn't know his stuff. There's a lot of great aspects to that. Like I
*  said, I liked that guy a lot, but there's a lot of fuckery in this movie, man. So I mean,
*  a couple of the most ridiculous things from the movie, we can get to boners. Slide 64.
*  You probably remember this morning. This was the guy who's like in Africa. He was a former special
*  forces sniper, I think. And he says this whole fantasy, we need to eat meat to get our protein.
*  It's actually bullshit. I mean, look at a gorilla. Gorilla will fuck you up in two seconds. What does
*  a gorilla eat? I just do the same things. These big gray things out here that we're trying to
*  protect elephant and rhino. Yeah. Well, it's just, it's a nonsensical argument. You know what will
*  fuck you up even faster than the gorilla? A human who has a gun that eats McDonald's and KFC.
*  What is a gun? It's a tool. How did we develop tools? Cause we started eating meat and fish
*  and we came down out of the trees and we weren't spending more than half of our waking hours eating
*  leaves and low calorie fruits. You know, we don't like comparing our digestive, like what we should
*  eat with a gorilla is just asinine. That's a problem because they, they bring that up all the time. They
*  say we have the same digestive gut tract as an herbivore. That's just not true. Also just
*  objectively false. Yeah. You know, the, the large, for a gorilla, the largest volume of their digestive
*  tract is in their large intestine, which is ideal for breaking down tough foods, you know, fiber
*  seeds and those kinds of plant foods. Whereas in humans, the largest volume of our digestive tract
*  is in the small intestine, which is better for absorbing nutrient dense bioavailable foods like
*  meat and cooked foods, cooked tubers and things like that. You know, a gorilla in order to get the
*  amount of protein that gets them strong and rip, they eat 40 to 60 pounds of food a day and they're
*  eating for more than half of their waking hours. So it's really, you know, that's just not comparable
*  at all to compare us to, to, we also have different genes. It's the same thing when they're
*  talking about oxes, like strong as an ox. Uh, there's a myostatin issue, right? There's a,
*  the genes are programmed to carry more muscle. So yeah, that's Patrick Baboumi. And he says,
*  you know, people ask me, how did you get strong as an ox without eating meat? And have you ever
*  seen an ox eating meat? Well, I say, have you ever seen a human with six different stomachs
*  standing in a field eating, you know, grass for 14 hours a day? That's ridiculous. It's not, it's
*  like, to me those, those damage the credibility of the movie. Cause it's just sound bites. It sounds
*  cute. Like people go, yeah, you ever seen an ox eat that eat what a gorilla eats. That's what I do.
*  Yeah. I just, I, right. It just, to me though, that's like the quality of the argument being
*  made. It really does. There's no one there like you to dispute it. That's the problem. We, you know,
*  that's why I bring you aboard. I mean, and then there was the anthropologist woman. You remember
*  that scene in the end where she, that, that's where I really started rolling my eyes. Cause she
*  was making the arguments that humans have always followed a plant-based diet. Did you, do you
*  remember that part? Okay. So, um, we're going to start with that. So, I mean, we've got, um,
*  isotope studies that show that humans have been eating meat for at least two and a half million
*  years. And if you go back even before we are really actually human, um, there's a lot of evidence now
*  that our chimp ancestors were also eating vertebrates. And one of the biggest shocks for people has been
*  the observation that chimps hunt and they kill other monkeys and other animals and eat them.
*  I mean, it kind of blew apart like this whole idea of primates only being, um, you know, eating
*  plants. And if that happened, if, if, if, uh, if an animal evolves complex behavior, like hunting
*  or tool use in order to eat certain food, it means that food has a lot of value or else that,
*  that behavior wouldn't have evolved. Um, but then we have bone collagen studies. Um,
*  let me see if I can find this slide, Jamie. So that's 47 and 48. So these are bone collagen
*  isotope studies are much more accurate than some of the previous methods that were used. And,
*  um, the, the earliest hominids that were studied, but these were Neanderthals. So there's three
*  studies that have been done in Neanderthal groups ranging from 130,000 to 28,000 years ago.
*  And then they compared those isotope levels with contemporary species and they found that Neanderthals
*  were similar to top level carnivores. So they all derived the vast majority of their protein from
*  animal sources, likely to be large herbivores. And then on the next slide, 48, why does it have,
*  hold on a second, back up. Why does it have a pterodactyl flying in the background? Why are
*  they bullshitting us? Does those fucking things live 60 fucking million years before? That's so
*  stupid. You know, there's a limit to what stock photography can, I know, but all you have to do
*  is snip that part out. You asshole. Why do you have a guy walking on two feet with a fucking
*  piece of meat on a stick of meat? That's so stupid. And he's obviously not a Neanderthal too.
*  The skull is the wrong shape, right? Yeah. So double crazy. So that's a homo sapien,
*  which is only 500,000 years ago. Let's talk about homo sapiens. So,
*  so there were, there were on the next slide, there are two, two, uh, stable isotope bone
*  collagen studies that have been done with modern humans, homo sapiens, sapiens. And the first group
*  was 13,000 years ago in Southern England. And the second group was 30 to 40,000 years ago in
*  La Crovette, which is in France. And they also found, um, that they were predominantly, you know,
*  carnivores, mostly large herbivores, but the French group consumed a more diverse mix of protein,
*  including seafood. So the fossil record clearly, clearly indicates that humans were eating, you
*  know, humans and Neanderthals, you know, homo sapiens and Neanderthals, all of our hominid
*  ancestors were eating a lot of meat. And she wasn't using any evidence to cite this either,
*  was she? She was using that lame anatomical argument that we have, you know, relatively flat
*  molars like herbivores do, and we don't have claws and we don't have sharp canine teeth.
*  But guess what? We've got forks, we've got knives, and we've got fire. We've got fire to cook our
*  food. And we have fire for a long fucking time. We have these adaptations that make those anatomical,
*  uh, uh, characteristics that a lion or, you know, or a carnivorous animal has unnecessary for us.
*  I mean, that's, that's just like anthropology 101. So I don't,
*  so they just found someone who's vegan, who's also an anthropologist.
*  One anthropologist, and then they rewrite the whole history of, you know, animal food consumption
*  among hominids. Yeah. And the argument that human beings over two million years ago, the doubling of
*  the human brain size corresponds with the, the learning how to hunt, consuming more meat.
*  Of tool marks on bones corresponded directly with the doubling of brain volume, the reduction in our
*  gut volume, which indicates a move to a more nutrient dense diet, the increase in the volume
*  of our small intestine relative to our large intestine. And then what's called the gracilization
*  of our jaw, which means our teeth and jaw became less robust. And that's thought to be an adaptation
*  to more digestible, nutrient dense bioavailable food where we're not like chewing cut or chewing
*  on leaves or low calorie fruit like a gorilla is all day. And this argument about nutrient density,
*  this is why this, that, that term is very important because people always want to use that for plant
*  based foods, nutrient dense plant based foods. Meat is far more nutrient dense per calorie,
*  per ounce, poor amino acid profile. With essential nutrients. Yeah. So it's essential
*  meaning nutrients that we can't manufacture on our own and that we, and then we absolutely need,
*  organ meats are actually at the top of the list in terms of, you know, in terms of nutrient
*  density, organ meats and shellfish take the cake. Then you have herbs and spices are actually pretty
*  high too. And then you have other, you know, muscle meats, eggs, all of those things, foods like grains
*  and legumes are tend to be towards the bottom of the list, you know, with vegetables and in the
*  middle. Right. But that sounds good. Nutrient dense plant based foods sounds good. It sounds
*  like you're doing the right thing. And this is like where this lingo is coming from. I mean,
*  this is where I argue that plants do belong because plants do have certain nutrients,
*  phytonutrients, fibers and things that actually don't feed us, but feed our gut flora that I do
*  think are important, even though they're not considered essential like vitamin B 12 or vitamin
*  A, you know, vitamin D or something like that. I do think they're still important and they play a
*  role. But what I'm talking about is the difference between caveman altering its diet or the modern or
*  ancient man altering their diet and this doubling of the human brain size corresponding with
*  consuming more nutrient dense foods. What that means is meat. Yeah, absolutely. Meat, fish and
*  fish first, as we saw with some of the modern humans who are living in coastal regions,
*  but these more bio bio available nutrient dense foods. Definitely. Now, what other silliness?
*  So this is the anthropology argument that just doesn't seem to fit any of the state of the art
*  science. Doesn't fit. Yeah, it completely contradicts. So then there was the whole section
*  that you probably remember about chicken and fish causing cancer, dairy products causing cancer.
*  They started to just, it really kind of went from just like, you can do well on a plant based diet
*  as an athlete to like animal products are horrible and are going to kill you,
*  which was a big leap. So they had one study, James Wilkes says, you know, research funded by
*  the National Cancer Institute found that vegetarians who had one or more servings per week of white meat
*  like chicken and fish more than tripled their risk of colon cancer. Well, that's scary. You know,
*  I don't want to triple my risk of colon cancer. But again, if you look at the totality of the
*  research slide 42, Jamie 2017, a meta analysis of 16 prospective studies with with almost two and
*  a half million participants found no increase in cancer risk from consuming fish or poultry.
*  And then you have a statement from the American Cancer Institute itself saying, as for other
*  animal products, organizations that do comprehensive evidence reviews to make dietary
*  recommendations currently do not recommend against poultry like chicken, turkey ground or fresh fish
*  or dairy. So where's that coming from then? One study that looked at Seventh Day Adventists who
*  added some of those foods back into their diet. This is a perfect example of healthy user bias
*  because Seventh Day Adventists are not supposed to eat meat. So if you have a Seventh Day Adventist
*  who's bucking the trend, who's rebelling and eating meat, then what else are they doing that
*  is also not healthy and not following the dictates of that healthy lifestyle? So that was that was a
*  small take that into consideration. They didn't ask them whether they're drinking or I was a
*  six year study in the Seventh Day Adventist cohort from 1976 to 1982. And it was what I call them
*  SDA rebels, you know, they're supposed to eat vegetarian, but they had meat. So what else are
*  they doing that's confounding that? And the reason why this is relevant is this is the only
*  study that we know of that does show a correlation between. There might be other individual studies
*  that do, but this is why we have these large reviews that look at, you know, this one looked
*  at 16 studies with two and a half million participants and found no association. And then
*  that's why you have groups like the American Cancer Institute who say, you know, make this
*  recommendation. Well, I mean, people were up in arms at the most recent recommendation that
*  can't do that. People have been told to avoid red meat. Oh yeah. And then they said, well, actually,
*  there's no risk at all eating red meat. We're taking that off of the list of foods to avoid.
*  And everybody went, hey, they just went ape shit. Let's talk about the lack of a better term. Yeah,
*  they did. They freaked out. Cause it conflicts with the dogma. Absolutely. And this was,
*  this was a five paper review. So it wasn't just one paper was five papers all in one review. It was
*  millions of participants. You know, they, they reviewed all of the available literature on red
*  meat, you know, and in its relationship with any disease, heart disease, cancer, type two diabetes.
*  It was dozens of studies following people for up to 35 years and millions, again,
*  millions of participants. They looked at randomized controlled trials. They looked at
*  observational cohort studies. They looked at all kinds of outcomes, total mortality,
*  cardiovascular, cancer, et cetera. And they found quote, only low or very low certainty evidence
*  that red meat causes any kind of disease. And then in the editorial, um, in the annals,
*  which is what it was published, Annals of Internal Medicine, the journal was published
*  and they said, quote, this is slide 19, Jamie, over and over again, they, the authors stress
*  that even if the results were statistically significant, their certainty was low and the
*  absolute differences seen were small and potentially confounded, meaning could have been that they were
*  smoking more or drinking more or, you know, not exercising or whatever. The editorial also said,
*  this is sure to be controversial, but it's based on the most comprehensive review of the evidence
*  to date because that review is inclusive. Those who seek to dispute it will be hard pressed to
*  find appropriate evidence with which to build an argument. Unless you have a nice documentary.
*  Yeah. And you can just put in whatever fucking evidence you want. Yeah. Yeah. Um, the, the
*  really frustrating thing for people is also recommend process. It's unprocessed and processed.
*  So the, the dogma had always been, well, just stay away from processed meat and you can avoid
*  fresh red. Yeah. Cause some studies showed no difference with fresh, but some difference
*  process red meat. You know, I think you could make a stronger argument that process too much
*  processed meat might be harmful because of things like in nitroso compounds that are formed,
*  et cetera. But even then you have to consider context. Most people are eating hot dogs with
*  buns and French fries and big gulps. You know, it might, it's probably a different effect than having
*  bacon a couple of times a week with your whole foods diet or having some salami and nuts,
*  you know, not the same as eating, uh, you know, fake processed meat all the time.
*  And one of the things that's weird about this whole conversation is it's, it's, there's a
*  battleground. So like a volley gets thrown out there like this, like, boom, it's okay to eat red
*  meat. And you see the other side scrambling to refute the evidence and, and then fire back with
*  all these epidemiology studies that show that red meat can kill you and red meats cause you to age
*  quicker. Red meat kills your boners and red meat does this and does that. And it's like,
*  it's, it's where there's a religious war going on.
*  It's the same thing we were talking about earlier. Now, when you have some kind of political event,
*  or some event that happens, it gets spun. You know, if you go watch CNN, it's going to get spun
*  one way. If you go watch Fox, it's going to get spun the other way. It's the same event,
*  but you have these totally different interpretations.
*  Yeah. What else was a bummer?
*  Well, you want to talk about the boners?
*  Sure.
*  Let's talk about the boners. I found that to be entirely hilarious, ruthlessly unscientific.
*  Yeah.
*  And like the whole thing with the guy saying, you know, I'm going to eat what a gorilla eats.
*  I mean, they're showing this guy who's protecting rhinos who are being slaughtered for their,
*  for their horns. Like, what does that have anything to do with eating meat?
*  Yeah. They're, they're morally equating that with eating.
*  Exactly.
*  Well, they're, what they're doing is-
*  It was pretty obvious what they were doing there.
*  Yes.
*  Even though they didn't say that, that's what they were doing.
*  They're attaching themselves to an indisputable cause.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I mean, everybody wants people to stop shooting rhinos for their horns. Everyone does.
*  If you don't, you're an asshole. Don't eat meat.
*  What?
*  How'd you get that in there? You guys snuck that in there. What the fuck did you do?
*  Yeah. Yeah. So the, for those who haven't seen the film, the, the, the erection, the, the boner
*  experiment, if we're going to call it that is, um, they, it was Aaron Spitz who's a urologist and he
*  puts penis rings on a bunch of NFL players. And then he looks at measures the effects of different
*  meals on their erections, both the, the, the circumference, I guess, the size of the erection,
*  the duration, the intensity of the erections. So he feeds the players, burritos with meat in them,
*  and then he feeds them the same burrito with like a plant protein. I'm not sure what it was,
*  Tempe or something like that. And then he claims-
*  It was beans.
*  Was it beans? Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe. And then he claims that the athletes who ate the pure plant burritos had 500%
*  more frequent erections and also increased strength of erections. So what can we conclude
*  from this experiment? Absolutely nothing, because it was just an experiment that was made up and done
*  in a film. It was not peer reviewed. There was no, it's not scientific at all. You know, that's the
*  whole scientific- Well, here's how it could have been scientific, right? If they did it
*  in different orders. So they put the, the, the penis band on the dudes one night, they had to
*  eat whatever the fuck they had to eat. You know, I think it was steak burritos. And then the next
*  night they put the penis bands on them again and they have them eat beans. And so they say you got
*  more erections. Did you guys jerk off in between then? Did you guys have sex? Did you get used to
*  having the penis band on when you slept with it the first time? Did it bother you? Did it interrupt
*  your sleep the second time? Were you more comfortable with it? Did you guys try to reverse it
*  one day, the first day on a different group of people, give them the band and make them eat a
*  vegetarian diet from the next day, give them the band on the second day and make the meat steak?
*  Did you, did you switch that up? You can ask any number of questions. And that's the whole point.
*  Of science. That's why we have science. That's why we have a process of peer review. That's why
*  we have reproducibility, meaning even if one group comes up with one finding, it's not really
*  worth much until somebody else reproduces that. Something like 90, 90% or more of findings,
*  scientific findings are not reproduced. That means that we can't trust them.
*  So I would like to know if they were asked to not engage in sexual intercourse or masturbation
*  during that time period, because that would, that would make sense that they were getting more
*  erections and more full erections the next day, especially the young guys that are savages.
*  I went to look at research like, is there any peer reviewed research that shows that plant-based
*  diets are better for erectile function and lower the risk of erectile dysfunction?
*  Couldn't find anything. I did find studies, one study of a Mediterranean diet, which includes
*  animal, some animal products, reduced erectile dysfunction relative to a low fat diet,
*  which maybe might have fewer animal products. So that kind of contradicts it perhaps.
*  There were studies that showed that like diet quality is more, is important. So Western diet
*  high in processed foods led to erectile dysfunction, diet rich in flavonoid containing foods,
*  which be fruits and vegetables, reduced erectile dysfunction. But none of that says it has anything
*  to do with meat. Just says like, don't eat a junk food diet if you don't want erectile dysfunction.
*  Yeah. It's just deceptive. There was another, but you know, it does show that those guys did get
*  more hard ons under that circumstance. But as you said, what does that mean?
*  What does it mean? And can we even trust it? I mean, frankly, given some of the other stuff in
*  the film. Right. Can you trust it? Can you trust that? I mean, who's to say? Right. There was
*  another thing that was deceptive, or at least it confused people. That's when they made them eat a
*  bean burrito and they checked their blood. Oh, their cloudy blood. Yeah, their cloudy blood.
*  Okay. That was, I was just sitting there shaking my head going, what in the fuck are you doing?
*  This has nothing to do with health. So again, not a peer reviewed experiment, something that was
*  or controlled study in any way, just something that they did in the film. So yeah, they fed the
*  burritos, you know, with meat, without meat, and they measured their blood afterwards.
*  Big surprise if the people who ate meat, which has more fat and more saturated fat had cloudier
*  blood. Well, that's normal. That's just naturally what you would expect from the process of eating
*  feet. You will temporarily have more fat in your blood. That has nothing to do with health.
*  So what is the big question? It might actually be better for you. So what might be better for you?
*  And so then I went and I thought, okay, well, what does the peer reviewed research show about
*  animal protein and endothelial function? Because their claim was that eating the animal protein
*  reduces your endothelial functioning and increases inflammation. So this, there was one,
*  study that a lot of the, there are a couple studies that show a low carb diet impairs
*  endothelial function, but they tend to be short term, like four weeks. I look for longer term
*  studies. There was a 2009 study that followed subjects for 12 weeks and they found the low
*  carb diet actually improved endothelial function, whereas a low fat diet decreased it. And then
*  there was a 2007 study that followed subjects for a year and there was no change in endothelial
*  function on a low carb diet. We actually, there's strong evidence that high blood sugar and insulin
*  resistance impair endothelial function. So, you know, a low carb diet that would lower your blood
*  sugar and improve insulin resistance would be expected to improve it from that perspective. So
*  again, when you look at the actual science, the actual peer reviewed research, you don't see that
*  relationship that they're talking about. They didn't even, I mean, when they're showing it to
*  you, it's just scare tactics. They're not, they're not talking about what that means.
*  What's persuasive, you know, people see it and they're like, oh my God, the blood is cloud. Even
*  the football players who were in the experiment, they were like, oh wow, I'm not going to eat my
*  KFC or Popeyes anymore. And I'm like, well, you probably shouldn't, but it's not for that reason.
*  Right. Well, saturated fat is the demon, right? That keeps getting addressed. Explain why saturated
*  fat is not only healthy, but probably necessary. Well, I don't know that it's necessary, but I would,
*  I would say that, you know, I should say cholesterol is necessary. Well, cholesterol is necessary.
*  And our body makes it too. Actually, most of the cholesterol that we have in our body, we manufacture,
*  it doesn't come from the diet. About 30% comes from the diet. About 70% we make it. The exact
*  ratio varies depending on the person. And you know, some people are hyper responders of dietary
*  cholesterol, so they'll absorb more from food, but it's, you know, it plays a vital role in the body.
*  There's a genetic disease called Smith-Lemley-Opitz syndrome, which results in severe cholesterol
*  deficiency and it's, it's fatal. So you die with not enough cholesterol. I'm not, however, one of
*  these people on the other end of the spectrum that thinks, Hey, if your cholesterol is 450,
*  don't worry. No problem. There's, you know, like, you know, just write it off. I think
*  the truth is somewhere in the middle. And it's biological variable. It's variable. Yeah. And
*  you can get, and I see this, you know, I've been working with patients for over 10 years. I test
*  every single person that comes through the door with a full lipid panel. And I have people who are
*  doing keto, super low carb diets who have totally optimal normal cholesterol. And then I have people
*  who go from eating, you know, a low moderate fat diet to like a high fat keto or low carb diet. And
*  their LDL-P goes up to 2500 or 3000 and their LDL cholesterol goes up to 300. So yeah, I mean,
*  what I can, I think what stepping back a little bit, as we talked about this with Joel, but
*  cholesterol for decades was, it was the boogeyman, you know, it was like that led to like egg white
*  omelets and boneless skinless chicken breast and, you know, bagels with nothing on them
*  when I was growing up. And now even the- Margarine. Margarine. Oh my God. I can't believe it's not
*  butter. Yeah. I thought it was better than butter. Hilarious. Which like rats won't even eat if you
*  leave it out in the garage. Really? Yeah. Really? Yeah. So- Rats eat batteries. They won't eat
*  margarine? That's what I've heard. I've never done this experiment. We need to do an experiment.
*  We should do it. Otherwise we're pushing out disinformation as well. Propaganda. Go ahead.
*  So yeah, you know, the U.S. quietly actually removed the limitation of dietary cholesterol.
*  They used to limit it to 300 milligrams. Now that they don't have that anymore because the evidence
*  didn't justify having that in the dietary guidelines. We were the last industrialized country
*  to do that. Every other company country had done that years ago. Right. But because, you know,
*  how entrenched that was in our country. And I think, you know, they don't want to lose credibility.
*  It's like they've been saying not to do something for so long, then to turn around and say, actually,
*  right, there's no evidence to support that. It's- you lose face. And when people talk about saturated
*  fat and they talk about it as being only a meat or animal diet issue, one thing that I always like
*  to bring up is avocados. Yeah. There's a certain amount of unsaturated fat and saturated fat.
*  Every food has all three fats in some proportion. So you have saturated, mono unsaturated, and
*  polyunsaturated. And dairy products are actually the only category of foods that consistently have
*  more saturated fat than any other type of fat. Pork, for example, often has more mono unsaturated
*  fat than saturated and even sometimes, yeah, lean beef. And what's really interesting about that is
*  that studies consistently show that full fat dairy, which would be like the highest saturated fat
*  class of foods, is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, reduced risk of diabetes,
*  reduced weight, and all kinds of other improvements. Full fat dairy is?
*  Full fat dairy. Now is this raw dairy, like raw milk?
*  They don't different- they're not differentiating like that in the studies. Just any full fat dairy.
*  Why do you think so many people are lactose intolerant then? Because it seems that that's
*  an issue. And I think I seem to have it a little bit. And my nine-year-old daughter definitely has
*  it. Well, so it wasn't until 11- before 11,000 years, 12,000 years ago, we didn't raise animals
*  for dairy. So there was no need that we only had to digest lactose while we were breastfeeding.
*  So like in a hunter-gatherer culture, as soon as you stop breastfeeding,
*  you no longer had the need to digest lactose. And so our bodies are efficient. We stop producing
*  lactase, which is the enzyme to break down lactose and for the rest of our adult life. But then
*  about 12,000 years ago, we started, you know, somebody figured out, hey, let's drink some milk
*  from that ruminant animal over there. And milk dairy products help people avoid starvation. And
*  there was a good source of hydration and nutrients. And so that mutation started to spread. And now
*  it's about one third of the world has lactase persistence, which means they can digest
*  lactose all the way into adulthood and two thirds don't. And it depends a lot on your ancestry.
*  So two thirds people are lactose intolerant. Wow, that's interesting. So the people who tend to
*  be lactose tolerant are people of European, particularly Northern European descent, like
*  lactose tolerance or lactase persistence approaches like 97% in Scandinavia. So Denmark,
*  Norway, Sweden, they can almost all digest milk. And then East Africans. So you have like the
*  Maasai, you know, people who've been raising cattle for a long time tend to have those,
*  that capability. Whereas like in Asia, other parts of Africa, in other parts of the world,
*  not as much. What difference if any, does it make when it's not homogenized and pasteurized
*  in terms of your digestion? Because for me, I don't have a problem with raw milk.
*  Raw milk seems to be easy for me. Yeah, I think there is a difference. I mean,
*  it contains enzymes in it that help you break down the lactose. So that can make a difference. But
*  I mean, just I would love to see research that further differentiates the health benefits of
*  dairy according to whether it's organic or whether it's homogenized or not and all that.
*  But even just talking about dairy as a whole category. I mean, you had Dr. Walter Willett
*  in there saying there's evidence of high consumption of proteins from dairy is related
*  to higher risk of prostate cancer. The chain of cancer causation seems pretty clear. But if you
*  bring up slide 44, Jamie, there was a 2019 study, largest review of dairy ever been done before. It
*  was 153 meta-analyses that they reviewed. So not just individual studies, they reviewed 153 studies
*  that were also reviewing other studies. And 84% of the meta-analyses on dairy showed either no
*  association or an inverse association between dairy and cancer. Meaning when it's inverse,
*  it means people who ate more dairy had lower rates of cancer. Whoa. So I just, it's frustrating,
*  to see someone make a claim like that. And then you go and you look at the full totality of the
*  research and you see just exhaustive study like this with 153 meta-analyses. And 84% are showing
*  no relationship or a beneficial effect of dairy on cancer. Why wasn't that mentioned in the film?
*  Well, it's consistent with the way the message is being distributed through the entire film.
*  It's a propaganda movie. I mean, that's essentially what it is. It's like grief or
*  madness for meat. I mean, it really is. It's kind of crazy. It is crazy. I mean,
*  the thing that's hard, I mean, and this was true with Joel's, like that was three and a half hour
*  plus debate. I don't know how long we've been going now. And we've even barely scratched the
*  surface of like what we could say about the movie. And it's frustrating because the movie,
*  these kinds of movies leverage this rhetorical effect called the illusory truth effect,
*  which is basically if you repeat something enough times, it starts to sound true. And politicians
*  are great at this. Trump is actually a master at this. So, you know, meat is bad, meat is bad,
*  meat is bad, meat is bad. We've heard that so many times that someone can get on, make a film
*  and just include one little tidbit of information and say meat is bad. And it seems like, oh,
*  that's true. But then to break that down, we're here for two and a half hours and we're just
*  getting started. That's the trouble. Yeah, that is the trouble. And it's not
*  nearly as visually enticing. It's just you and me sitting here talking. Where's the pretty girls
*  running track and everybody laughing and having a good time eating falafels?
*  There's how many vegan documentaries that have been made, like a lot. What the Health,
*  Cowspiracy, this one. How many pro regenerative agriculture,
*  holistically managed, healthy, nutrient dense meat movies can you think of?
*  I can't think of any. Yeah. So there's one coming,
*  unfortunately, it's called Sacred Cow. It's coming out next year. Rob Wolf is involved in that.
*  I was interviewed by it. It's made Diana Rogers, who's a registered dietitian, is making it. She's
*  also a regenerative farmer. So it's a very interesting perspective, having someone who
*  knows the nutrition side and who's also actually using those kind of regenerative, holistically
*  managed practices on her own farm. But it's not, James Cameron's not behind it. It's not going to
*  have Arnold in it. You know Arnold's eating a steak right now. That motherfucker, he's full of shit.
*  He just wanted to do, James Cameron's like, look, we're doing the Terminator. I really want you to
*  be a part of this. I'll do it. I'm in. I'm in. Only vegetables from now on. This steak was just
*  bullshit. I shouldn't have eaten it. I want to catch that motherfucker, fog with a chow
*  with that little chip on green, just hacking it. Look at him. I mean, this steak is why it's so big.
*  The thing is, he didn't become Mr. Universe by eating, drinking soy protein shakes. Well,
*  I mean, again, he's eating steroids. That's what he's eating. That's what he was eating.
*  But he was eating also 250 pounds of beef proteins a day. Not quite that much, but
*  grams. 250 grams. He wasn't eating five cups of lentils to do that. So that's the other thing
*  too. You have to recognize with this movie, a lot of the people who were amazing athletes,
*  they didn't start out vegan. They weren't born to vegan parents and then were vegan growing up
*  and then had all these amazing records and performance. They built their strength or
*  their agility or their speed or whatever on a diet with animal products. And then at some point,
*  they became vegan and maybe their performance continued and they continued to do well like
*  Scott Jurek or Dottie Bausch, or maybe they had the vegan honeymoon where they did well for a while
*  and then they declined or maybe they just declined like some of the NBA and NFL athletes we talked
*  about. But this is a critical point because there are key developmental periods when we're kids
*  and also in utero that if you're not getting the nutrition you need then it's going to carry
*  through to your whole life. And so it's like, what did your parents eat? What did your mom eat when
*  she was breastfeeding you? What did you eat as a young kid? So we follow that whole argument
*  through. If everyone becomes plant-based, it's going to have a huge intergenerational impact
*  on performance. It's not like people who built their strength and performance eating meat and
*  then they go vegan and they do okay for a little while. It's like, what are the consequences of
*  that happening to everybody? What are the consequences of growing up nutritionally
*  deficient? Yeah. Of the mom starting that way and then getting pregnant and becoming deficient
*  during pregnancy and then the baby being breastfed by a mom who's nutrient deficient and then the
*  kid being fed a vegan diet and developing B12 deficiency which then has irreversible effects.
*  Are there any top of the food chain world champion vegan athletes?
*  Like the best of the best? Well, there's no vegan UFC champions. There's no world champion
*  vegan boxers that I'm aware of. There's Ilya Ilyin. Do you know him? No. He's the weightlifter
*  that's I think in the same weight class as Kendrick Farris who was in the film
*  and two-time Olympic champion where I don't think Kendrick has won, he's not won a gold medal.
*  But he was stripped of his titles because he tested positive for steroids. So once again,
*  you know, what's happening, it's hard to say. He was pulled from the film because of that, right?
*  Yeah. He was pulled from the film. Or was he in the film? I believe he was originally supposed
*  to be in the film now that you brought this up. Yeah, that's not a good narrative for them, right?
*  And then they had like Tim Schieff, if I'm pronouncing his name correctly, he's like the
*  free runner parkour guy who was going to be in the film and then he had this very public
*  I'm not vegan anymore because it was destroying my health video on YouTube.
*  He ate a piece of salmon and had a wet dream for the first time in a decade.
*  Okay, buddy. I mean, it was like- Poor bastard. Yeah, he was doing everything. He did a 30-day
*  water fast. He tried everything to stay on the vegan diet. It wasn't like, oh, it's hard,
*  I'm going to eat salmon. I should also tell you he thinks the earth's flat.
*  Oh, does he? Yes. Uh-oh. Yeah. Yeah. I bet that could be the vegan diet. All those years
*  rotten his fucking brain. Yeah. Well, one of the main guys, the anthropological argument that
*  humans are herbivores because we don't have claws and sharp teeth, that all comes from Milton Mills,
*  a 1987 paper from him. He's an emergency room physician. He has no training in
*  medical anthropology or comparative anatomy or anything like this. He is a creationist.
*  So he thinks that we were just built this way and with these teeth and the way by God.
*  Yeah. That whole why don't we this? If we are carnivorous species, why don't we this?
*  How come we don't have the teeth to do that? How come you can't just grab a squirrel and eat it?
*  I've actually heard a guy say that. Well, hey, fuck face. How come you can't eat lentils? You
*  got to boil them. Yeah. Like, what are you talking about, man? Try eating cassava without cooking it.
*  You'll die. Yeah, you'll die. Yeah. Poisoning. Yeah. It's like that argument is so stupid.
*  There's a lot of plant-based foods that are only consumed after lengthy cooking. Yeah. I mean,
*  going back to your question, I'm sure there are high level vegan athletes, but the thing is a
*  lot of the people who are commonly referred to like the Venus, the Williams sisters, Serena and Venus,
*  they're not vegan. Yeah. Why do they have there in the film? They showed them in the film and I was
*  like, wait a minute, they're not vegan. Well, because they're often, people often call them
*  vegan. They occasionally will have periods of veganism, I guess, but they're not vegan. They eat
*  meat. They eat animal products. They look like meat eaters. Tom Brady is another example. Another
*  one who looks like a meat eater. Who really does eat a lot of, predominantly plant-based, I guess,
*  but eats meat, especially in the winter. The Williams sisters are so powerful. I mean, it
*  would be a great like catch for that team. Right. If they were vegan, because like look at the
*  athleticism that these girls have. Yeah. But nope. But it was weird. They didn't say they were vegan.
*  They just showed them. And so you're like, oh, they're the best. They don't need to say it. Yeah.
*  Just show them. That's it. Well, same thing with Arnold. He's talking great about veganism. I can't
*  fuck it to you right now. Carving into a nice juicy ribeye. Come on, show me a picture. What is
*  he doing? Oh, that fuck. Epic Meal Time. He did a video with them like five years ago, eating a
*  80,000 calorie steak and egg sandwich. Jesus Christ, Arnie. When is this? Ostrich eggs. A couple
*  years ago. Oh, that's five years ago, bro. That's a long time ago. He could be all vegan now, I guess,
*  but. I doubt it. He was doing this while they were doing the new Terminator movie. Yeah. It's a James
*  Cameron movie. He's not stupid. Hollich boy. And even if he is now, he didn't, you know, he wasn't
*  then when he accomplished all of his athletic achievements. Yes, of course. Yeah. But that's
*  where it's weird, right? It's like he did everything spectacular with meat. And now he's saying,
*  you don't need it. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty. Three years later, he's part-time vegan, he's saying in
*  this article now. Now? Well, it's just two years after that Epic Meal Time thing. Oh. I've got a
*  picture of him in and out. That's not a vegan. That's a funny concept. Like, how are you part,
*  vegan, you know, I'm sure vegans would take issue with that. I heard a guy arguing with someone
*  about this once I talked about this. He said, I'm 90% vegetarian. And this was his argument,
*  like that, like vegetarian is a way to go. I'm 90% vegetarian. Like bitch, that's zero percent
*  vegetarian. You don't understand math. It's even more ridiculous with vegan because there's a whole
*  ethos obviously around it. Yeah. I'm 90% on fire. You bitch, you're on fire.
*  Yeah. Oh man, that doesn't make any sense. Yeah. And it's like I said before, all it takes sometimes
*  is a little, because like organ meats and shellfish and fish and eggs are so nutrient dense,
*  you don't have to eat a lot of them to get to get meat, your nutrition needs. Yeah. I've had
*  this conversation with vegans too about mollusks. And I was like, you know, I've heard it argued,
*  and Sam Harris has talked to me about this, that you can actually make an ethical argument that
*  mollusks are more primitive than plants and that plants actually exchange more information through
*  mycelium, through the root structure. They actually communicate with each other. More evidence of
*  intelligence. Yeah. They're, mollusks are an older creature and they're, they're just dumb
*  hunks of meat you could scoop out of a container. I mean, they have no idea you're there.
*  They have just basic movement where they clamp shut. That's it. I mean, they're not going, stop,
*  no. They're not trying to get away like a fish. Mollusks just fucking lay there. And they happen
*  to be, like I said, among the most nutrient dense foods on the planet. Like one serving of oysters,
*  I think will meet your need for zinc for the entire week. Yes. That's pretty impressive.
*  That's, we're talking about like. Yes. And that's always been associated with male virility.
*  Yeah. I mean, zinc is super important for so many different functions. For its owners,
*  they should have done that test, right? Eat a bunch of raw oysters. Imagine that,
*  eight times more than the guys who are eating plants with the ring around their penis.
*  Yeah. What else is going on with this film that drives you crazy?
*  Well, I mean, going back to the whole environmental argument, I mean, that's,
*  that's another big one. We didn't get a chance to talk about that as much with
*  Joel because it would have been nine hours instead of four hours. He would have.
*  Yeah. So. His way of communicating is just so frustrating. It's so awkward and car salesman-y.
*  So one of the most common claims is like, you know, cattle are eating all of the human food.
*  So like, you know, corn and things that we could feed the world with. Yes. Well, the reality is
*  86% of what cattle eat is not edible by humans. We talked about that before. They're eating
*  soy cakes and grass and fobs and things that we can't digest and absorb. But I think the argument
*  would be that if you just grew the same, like use that same area to grow human food,
*  you could do that because we're using that area to grow cow food.
*  Well, so you replace the, the feedlot beef with grasslands and then you have naturally,
*  you know, holistically managed cow there. And then you take the land that we can't,
*  as I said before, 60% of land you can't grow crops on. So it's not, it's, you can't say that
*  you can't say we can just take everywhere that we could have livestock and plant.
*  No, I'm not even saying that anywhere we have monocrops where we're growing food just for
*  feeding cows, you could grow say tomatoes. That's one option. But the other option is to
*  use that land for grasslands, which could create, make it a carbon sink rather than having still
*  emissions coming from mono industrial agriculture. I understand what you're saying, but I mean,
*  if I was on the other side, I would argue, well, wouldn't it be easier to just grow human edible
*  corn in that place instead of no, no, no, because corn is ridiculously low in nutrient value
*  or something else or soy or whatever. Okay. Um, if you look again at this idea of the animals
*  are the middleman. Yes, that's not a bad thing. That's a good thing. If you look at the conversion
*  ratio of feed like corn, which is super nutrient poor, you know, corn is as low in protein. It
*  doesn't have any nutrients at all. 2.6 to 2.8 kilograms of corn get converted into one kilogram
*  of beef. So even in that 14% of human edible food that the livestock are eating, they're converting
*  it to highly nutrient dense bioavailable protein that humans can eat. And if you do the conversion
*  with just protein instead of like by weight of food, they take 0.6 kilograms of corn or other
*  low value protein and convert that into one kilogram of very high value, um, nutrient dense
*  protein. So it, you know, it's always more nuanced than, than the argument makes it seem.
*  Yeah. And that, that is the point. The water is another example. So, you know,
*  2,400 gallons of water to produce a pound of beef is the typical claim that you hear.
*  What you don't hear is that vast majority of water, even from feedlot beef, 94% is green water,
*  which means it just, it's rainfall and six, only 6% comes from is groundwater, like from irrigation
*  for pasture raised beef. It's even more significant. 97% of the water for pasture raised
*  beef comes just from rainfall and 3% from irrigation and beef really only, if you only
*  think about blue water, like irrigation, it requires 280 gallons of blue water per pound of
*  beef. That might sound like a lot, but it's actually less than you need to produce a pound
*  of avocados, almonds, walnuts, rice, or sugar. Well, you don't hear that in the film or in these
*  arguments at all. And again, it speaks to what you're saying. These are nuanced issues. These
*  are nuanced issues and the devil is in the details. And so we were talking about with cow,
*  again, we have to stress that only somewhere in the neighborhood of two to 3% of all cows
*  are grass fed grass. So the ones that are eating grain are consuming more water, but even then it's
*  still less water than they're saying. Exactly. And less than some other commonly eaten vegan foods,
*  especially almonds. Almonds are particularly, they're very resource heavy, right? Absolutely.
*  Yeah. But sugar, I mean, yeah, that's crazy. Huh? Yeah. Yeah. What else about the film?
*  You want to talk about fake meat? Sure. Yeah. A little bit. Yeah. It wasn't covered as much
*  in the film, but it's, I think it's important for someone like you that really understands it to
*  talk about it. So people get, this could be a standalone clip. So just for people who know,
*  who aren't aware, there are companies like Impossible Burger and Beyond Meat that are
*  promoting this idea of fake meat that tastes like meat. And, but it's made typically from soy. So
*  Impossible Burger's main ingredients are GMO soy, coconut oil, sunflower oil, natural flavors.
*  Beyond Meat is pea protein isolate, canola oil, refined coconut oil. So Impossible Burger has
*  publicly criticized holistic land management or regenerative agriculture and saying, ah, it doesn't
*  it's not really that different. In fact, sometimes the emissions can be even more than
*  feedlot beef. But there was a third party life cycle analysis, full life cycle. So they looked
*  at the whole process, not just methane emissions from cows burping, but the whole process at White
*  Oak Pastures, which is a beef operation. It's a, it's a savory Institute hub. So they're following
*  this, the regenerative savory Institute practices. And they found that their beef operation was a net
*  carbon sink. So again, it actually sequestered carbon from the atmosphere was not emitting
*  carbon. It was, you know, carbon, not, not neutral. It was taking carbon out.
*  Can I pause you for a second? This is something I forgot to bring up earlier. One thing that solves
*  the methane issue with cows is just to add a certain amount of seaweed to their diet.
*  When you add a certain amount of seaweed to your, to their diet, apparently it mitigates the methane,
*  the methane issue. I don't know about that. Yeah. I think that they'd find that Jamie, that's
*  something that was offered up as a response to, and I don't think it's a large amount of seaweed.
*  I think it's a fairly small amount of seaweed and percentage to the overall diet. I think the
*  amazing thing about the regenerative agri- the livestock or holistically managed beef though,
*  is it can actually restore grasslands. It can restore the soil and improve the soil. So you're
*  not only producing this amazing nutrient dense bioavailable food source, you're actually improving
*  the soil and helping to reverse this really dramatic, threatening problem that we're facing
*  of soil erosion. Seaweed could help make cows burp less methane and cut their carbon footprint.
*  LOL. A diet supplemented with red algae could lessen the huge amounts of greenhouse gases
*  emitted by cows and sheep. If we can just figure out how to grow enough. So I guess that's the issue.
*  You have to wonder where those, how that, you know, what kind of energy is being used. So back to
*  this, so this, this life cycle analysis at White Oak Pastures showed that this holistically managed
*  beef actually removes carbon from the atmosphere. Now this was the same company that performed a
*  life cycle analysis for Impossible Burger on their fake meat. And what they found in that analysis
*  was that the fake meat was less, you know, of a greenhouse gas emitter than
*  feedlot beef, but it was still actually an emitter. Whereas the holistically managed beef was taking
*  carbon out of the atmosphere. It was the same company. So, you know, if we're going to take,
*  give them credit for the analysis they did for Impossible Burger, we have to give them credit
*  for the analysis that they did for White Oak Pastures. The other thing with Impossible
*  Burger, so the primary ingredient is called soy leg hemoglobin or SLH. So this is a bioengineered
*  protein additive that adds meat-like taste and color. It does not meet the basic FDA generally
*  recognized as safe, the grass designation, because it's not a food or even a food ingredient.
*  And there's a document that you can get. I think it came with the Freedom of Information Act.
*  It's online. I have the reference in my show notes. And in the discussion in this document
*  with the FDA, Impossible Foods admitted that up to a quarter of its heme ingredient was composed of
*  46 unexpected additional proteins, some of which are unidentified and none of which were assessed
*  for safety in a dossier. Impossible Burger put the product on the market despite admitting to the FDA
*  privately that they haven't done adequate safety testing. And according to these documents,
*  quote, FDA believes that the arguments presented individually and collectively do not establish
*  the safety of SLH, soy leg hemoglobin, for consumption, nor do they point to a general
*  recognition of safety. So they don't know what the fuck it does. What's in it. But doesn't mean it's
*  bad. Doesn't mean it's bad. Just haven't done adequate safety testing in the opinion of the
*  FDA to release this as a food product. The company that did the tests on this Impossible
*  Burger versus the Regenerative B, what is that company again? Quantus International.
*  And so they're the ones who released the information for both studies.
*  It was the same company that did it for Impossible Burger. And then they turned around and did it for
*  White Oak Pastures. And they found Impossible Burger is still emitting carbon, whereas White
*  Oak Pastures is taking it out. Yeah, I think that's a very critical
*  point to make in this conversation. And there was an article criticizing fake meat by this
*  woman, Dana Pearls, who's part of an environmental organization called Friends of the Earth. And she
*  says, quote, instead of investing in risky new food technologies that are potential problems
*  masquerading as solutions, shouldn't we be investing in proven beneficial regenerative
*  agriculture and transparent organic food that consumers are actually demanding?
*  The only issue that they would have with this is yes, but now you're talking about killing animals.
*  And we're absolutely morally and ethically opposed to killing animals.
*  Yeah. I mean, we go back now to this 2018 paper that I mentioned earlier that examined the impact
*  of plant agriculture on animal deaths and found 35 to 250 mouse deaths per acre.
*  Mouse deaths?
*  Mouse deaths, deaths of mice, and up to 7.3 billion animals killed every year from plant
*  agriculture. If you count birds killed by pesticides, fish deaths from fertilizer runoff,
*  plus reptiles and amphibians, poisonings from eating toxic insects from the pesticides.
*  What's the number?
*  7.3 billion animals killed every year.
*  In terms of life, there's far more life taken by plant agriculture than there is
*  life taken by animal agriculture, even factory farming.
*  Oh yeah. We're not killing 7.3 billion cows.
*  Right. So the question is, do we value the larger animals more? Are they worth more to us?
*  Are fish and insects less significant life forms than mammals? Are small mammals like
*  root rodents less valuable than larger ones like cows? Is it better to kill many small animals
*  for foods like grains and legumes, which aren't very nutrient dense and don't meet our nutritional
*  needs than fewer large animals that are super nutrient dense? I mean, I'm not claiming to
*  answer these questions, but I think they're questions that haven't been adequately raised
*  and addressed in this ethical argument.
*  They haven't even been breached. And this is one that people dismiss offhandedly. These are lies
*  by meat eaters to justify their consumption. But what you're saying is-
*  And you could make an ethical argument that killing an animal explicitly to eat it is
*  ethically different than animals being killed as a sort of side effect of plant agriculture.
*  I'm not saying that that's a valid argument, but I've heard that argument.
*  I don't think it's a valid argument because once you're aware of it, you're doing it the same.
*  It's like the argument that I've had with people when they say that I don't kill animals,
*  but I eat meat, therefore it's better than what you do because I hunt. And I say,
*  no, you're killing an animal with your credit card.
*  It seems backwards.
*  You're killing an animal. You're just hiring someone to do it for you. You still go to jail
*  for murder if you hire someone to shoot somebody.
*  Right. And you're more disconnected from the whole process.
*  Yeah. It's even more bizarre. The whole thing is very, very strange. I think that's very
*  important though that you listed those numbers, that data, because that's irrefutable. And it's
*  one of those arguments that comes up that they just want to bury their head in the sand about.
*  If you're buying agriculture, unless you have your own organic farm where you are 100%
*  aware of every single aspect from seed to plucking and cooking, if you're not,
*  if you're buying from large scale agriculture, you're a part of the death machine.
*  Right. That's right. And you're also part of the environmental destruction machine
*  because these huge industrial scale monocropping operations are incredibly harmful for
*  the environment. And if you again, you think of pea protein, that's an incredibly processed food.
*  First of all, just growing peas at the scale you're going to need to have the world's largest pea
*  protein company. And then all of the processing that needs to happen from taking a pea to
*  isolated protein powder, which involves fossil fuels and all kinds of industrial processes,
*  that is not an environmentally friendly process. So is that better for the planet than having cows
*  that are being raised on land that couldn't be used for growing plants or other crop production
*  and rotating the animals in a way that restores grasslands and improves the health of the soil
*  that actually sequesters and removes carbon from the atmosphere? That again, like Dana
*  Pearls was saying, makes a lot more sense. It's a proven system than scaling up industry to make
*  more powders. Yeah. Scaling up industry to make pea powder and killing untold numbers of rodents.
*  Birds and destroying natural habitats. Because if you clear a field for peas, it doesn't have the
*  normal natural features. You don't have the habitat for those animals anymore.
*  I think it's so significant that you're talking about these regenerative farms because that really
*  is the only way you ever get the nutrients back into the soil. There was a book that I read many
*  years ago called Dead Doctors Don't Lie, where Dr. Joel Wallach talked about the mineral depletion
*  of our soil. And that this is something that they've known forever. That's like a slow degrading
*  of the nutrient density in the soil. I mean, that's one of the things that keeps me up at night.
*  Seriously, like soil and water. If we don't have soil, we don't know of any way to restore soil
*  once it's gone. So we have 60 years of soil left? 60 harvests left. Is that years? I don't know.
*  Harvest is probably more than once a year, I would guess. Really? I don't know. I'm not a farmer.
*  Not a farmer either. Yeah. Even if it is once a year. I think it's once a year. But I mean,
*  even if it is once a year. Yeah, basically. It's still 60 years is fucking terrifying.
*  Terrifying. If we knew an asteroid was coming. Yeah, I got an eight-year-old daughter.
*  That's her lifetime. Right. When she's 68, there's gonna be no food and cannibals running through
*  the streets. But we'll have fake meat. I don't even know if we will buy that. We will. Because
*  you have to grow soy. Yeah. We'll have no more fish left either.
*  What else? Let's see.
*  God, there's so much.
*  I just don't know how anyone's gonna refute this. Like I said, I really like James a lot.
*  If he decides to come back and come and sit with you after hearing this and watching this,
*  I don't know what he could say. Well, you know, like you said, when a new study comes out with
*  the meat, then you get the whole group of people pointing to all that epidemiology again, saying,
*  look, this study says meat has a higher risk of cancer. Then we have to do the whole thing
*  again. Healthy user bias, food frequency questionnaire, context, is everything. That's
*  why it's like, oh my God. I think we've hit most of the main points here. Anything else stand out
*  in your mind from the... No. ...watch it just this morning? Oh, okay. So I'd be remiss if we don't
*  at least touch on these. So, you know, you said before, like the argument against red meat has
*  always been like cholesterol and saturated fat. Right. And it was interesting in this movie,
*  they didn't really talk about that very much. They didn't talk about cholesterol a lot.
*  They probably forgot. They didn't forget. I'm pretty sure. I think what they're actually
*  acknowledging that those aren't super defensible positions at this point. And so they switched over
*  now to the new kids on the block, which are TMAO, New 5GC, and Heem Iron. So there was a guy who
*  said, let's see, Dr. Scott Stoll, that's slide 18, Jamie. So he says, in animal products,
*  you're getting protein packaged with inflammatory molecules like New 5GC, endotoxins, and Heem Iron.
*  When we consume animal products, it also changes the microbiome, bacteria that live in our gut,
*  and the bacterial species that have been shown to promote inflammation, overgrow, and begin to
*  produce inflammatory meteors like TMAO. So I'll briefly address each of those. But before I do
*  that, I want to just say a word about mechanisms versus outcomes. So nutrition research can focus
*  on outcomes, which is like number of heart attacks or number of deaths that happen in a population
*  over a given period of time, or it can focus on mechanisms, what caused those outcomes. So
*  if you use the example of red meat, they saw in these big observational studies that people who
*  ate more red meat died more or had more heart attacks or whatever. Now we know that that was
*  because of healthy user bias. It wasn't accurate finding, whatever. So then they start going,
*  trying to figure out what are the mechanisms. And so initially, the mechanism was saturated
*  cholesterol. Then it was saturated fat. Now those are not as defensible. So they're moving on to
*  these new mechanisms. Well, research on mechanisms is not very convincing if the outcome isn't there.
*  So you had that large paper that was just published, the five papers in the annals,
*  that showed very basically no evidence that red meat is correlated with any disease.
*  So why are we even bothering looking for all these mechanisms that explain why red meat
*  causes disease when we've got this exhaustive study that says that it doesn't?
*  Yeah.
*  But let's humor them and talk about these mechanisms for a minute. So new 5gc, that's a sugar,
*  basically. It acts as a signaling molecule. It helps distinguish self from not self.
*  Most mammals produce it. Humans don't, but like cows do. So when we eat the cow meat,
*  beef or drink milk, we get some new 5gc in our tissues. This is the theory. And then our bodies
*  attack it in an autoimmune response. So basically the idea is that new 5gc in meat causes an
*  autoimmune response and that increases the risk of disease. The problem is that hasn't been proven
*  at all. A 2003 paper found that feeding people large quantities of new 5gc didn't actually
*  increase their serum levels of new 5gc. So that's a problem. If you have studies showing that eating
*  it doesn't actually increase it in your blood, then it doesn't really make much of a difference.
*  And then you have groups like the Maasai. You could not design a diet higher in new 5gc.
*  They drink blood and milk from cows and they eat cow beef. And they have extremely low rates of
*  cardiovascular disease. And they look great. I mean, they're ripped. They're like all thin.
*  They don't look like people that have autoimmune disease and are dying early. So, all right. So
*  that's new 5gc. Then we have heme iron. So this is the form of iron that's in beef and other animal
*  products. So it is true that heme iron forms these compounds called N-nitroso compounds and
*  toxic aldehydes that are implicated in colon cancer. But again, context is everything. So
*  slide 22, Jamie, studies have found that chlorophyll rich foods like plants, basically,
*  if you eat them along with iron rich foods, that cancels out any potential harmful
*  effect of heme iron. So this is a study right here.
*  So that would be a great point to a omnivorous diet versus a carnivorous diet.
*  Exactly. This is what I was talking about before, where there's a lot of clinical evidence that
*  suggests that plants play an important role. Do I know for sure? No, I don't. But I'm just saying
*  this adds an element of uncertainty. So yeah, green vegetables, red meat and colon cancer,
*  chlorophyll prevents the cytotoxic and hyperproliferative effects of heme in a rat colon.
*  There was another thing that they talked about earlier that I just remembered while you were
*  talking. They were talking about fuel and the difference between carbohydrates for fuel and
*  protein that protein does not provide you with fuel, fuel for muscles, which is not true.
*  There's something that happens when your body eats protein that it can break it down to glycogen.
*  What is that called?
*  Gluconeogenesis.
*  Yes. So that process they just ignored in the film and the woman spoke about this.
*  Who was it that spoke about it? I don't remember who spoke about it.
*  I think it was a man, Dr. Loomis or something.
*  So when they were speaking, whoever it was that was speaking about it, when they were speaking
*  about it, they were speaking about it like, well, here you go. This is just a fact.
*  Case closed.
*  Yeah, case closed. Your body needs carbohydrates to convert to glycogen. And that's not true.
*  If you eat too much protein on a ketogenic diet, it will knock you out of ketosis because your
*  body will convert it. Everyone knows that.
*  That was a huge omission or oversimplification. I think you said this before and I agree with you.
*  For people who are doing explosive types of activity like MMA or CrossFit or
*  basketball or something like that, they're going to typically do better with some with
*  carbohydrate, a substantial portion of carbohydrate in their diet. Whereas it definitely,
*  we're seeing a pattern now of endurance athletes or endurance activities. A lot of those people
*  can thrive on a very low carb diet. Zach Bitter is one example, but there are others.
*  He's not just thriving. He's killing it.
*  He's murdering it. He's literally a world champion at running a hundred miles in under 12 hours,
*  which is just- It's insane.
*  That pace is bonkers.
*  It's hard to even comprehend.
*  Again, that guy's doing it on rib eyes. He was talking about how he ups his glucose before these
*  significant events. Absolutely. I want to be clear. I've heard him talk about this. He's not full-time
*  keto all the time. He knows what he's doing. He knows that as he's approaching the competition,
*  he needs more glucose, replenishes glycogen stores.
*  Extremely scientific approach.
*  Absolutely. It's not true to say that you don't need protein for muscle. Protein is all about
*  muscle synthesis. You can't do muscle protein synthesis without protein. That was weird.
*  Also, hasn't it been shown, I think Lane Norton, BioLane was talking about this in his debunking
*  of the game changers. It's actually been shown that glycogen absorption, or they get more recovery,
*  that's what it was, from carbohydrates mixed with protein than even carbohydrates alone
*  or protein alone.
*  That's why post-workout nutrition often is suggested that you have both protein and
*  carbohydrates. There's one more slide I want to show on the heme iron thing, which is
*  23 and 24. This is the largest meta-analysis of heme iron studies. Again, for people not familiar
*  with the term meta-analysis, it's where you look at a bunch of different studies that have been done
*  and you analyze them together. It's considered to be a very high quality form of evidence.
*  So they looked at all significant studies through 2015 and they found a significant association
*  between heme iron and disease only in the American cohorts. In the Netherlands, Canada, France,
*  Italy, Japan, and Sweden, there was no association found. So what does that tell us? Go to the next
*  slide please, Jamie. Well, if you eat heme iron in the context of a super crappy standard American
*  diet, it's associated with cancer and a problem. But if you eat heme iron in a European diet,
*  which is less crappy than the US, it's not. This is a perfect example again of context.
*  Also Europeans, they don't have grain fed steak.
*  Yeah, it's different quality meat, but I think it's probably more likely that they're not eating
*  that as much.
*  Yeah, there's far less grain fed, grain finished beef over there. When you eat it, it's really
*  evident when you have a steak over there.
*  So TMAO and then gut microbiota and I think we're done after that.
*  Okay.
*  Unless you've got more.
*  No, I think we did enough.
*  So TMAO, this is a molecule that's generated from choline, betaine, and carnitine in the gut by a
*  microbial metabolism. And some previous studies showed that taking carnitine supplements and
*  taking choline supplements does increase your blood levels of TMAO. In omnivores, they went up
*  by like 37 micromoles per liter and in vegetarians, 27. And that was used to argue that
*  vegetarianism was healthier because they didn't see as big of an increase in TMAO in response
*  to this carnitine and choline challenge. The problem is that research has not shown that
*  eating whole foods rather than taking supplements increases TMAO significantly,
*  especially eating meat and eggs. There was a study in 2014 showed you needed to eat four eggs in
*  order to raise TMAO at all. And the max rise was only three to six micromoles per liter compared
*  to 27 or 37, which I said from supplements in some and 10 to 15 and others. And then slide 25, Jamie,
*  this 1999 study tested the effect of 46 different foods on the urinary excretion of TMAO and six
*  different subjects. And eggs and red meat, as you can see, are barely even registering on the scale
*  there. Whereas 19 of 21 types of seafood raised TMAO and halibut raised TMAO 53 times more than
*  eggs did. So- Look at that halibut graph, it's crazy.
*  So here you have this argument, okay, TMAO is bad. We shouldn't eat red meat and eggs because of
*  TMAO, but halibut raises TMAO 53 times more than meat and eggs. And if you look at the research on
*  seafood consumption, it's almost universally associated with positive outcomes, lower risk
*  of cardiovascular disease, lower risk of death from early causes, all of the rest of it. So how
*  do we reconcile that here with this TMAO argument? Nobody has ever explained how to reconcile that.
*  So again, interesting mechanism, but the research is not really persuasive.
*  It seems like it's poorly understood in their cherry picking data.
*  Yep. The other thing is that back in the original paper by Dr. Stan Hazen about TMAO from 2013,
*  this is slide 26, Jamie, he said, the high correlation between urine and plasma levels
*  of TMAO argues for effective urinary clearance of TMAO. So what that suggests is that even if
*  we eat TMAO, our body clears it out pretty quickly in the diet. So if TMAO is high, it's probably
*  because of other factors. And studies have found at least three. One is insulin resistance increases
*  TMAO levels via an enzyme in the liver. Well, we know that about one in three Americans probably
*  have some form of insulin resistance, you know, 70% are overweight, 40% of our obese. So it's
*  possible that just being an insulin resistant overweight American increases your TMAO. It's
*  got nothing to do with me. Gut microbiota, like disrupted gut microbiome and studies have also
*  shown that SIBO, bacterial overgrowth in the intestine can reduce, can increase TMAO levels.
*  Ton of people are dealing with that, we know. And then kidney disease, which of course happens in
*  people who have diabetes. Now, 100 million Americans have either pre diabetes or diabetes
*  can also increase TMAO. So you've got all of these factors that just have to do with again,
*  crappy lifestyle, being overweight, being insulin resistant, nothing to do with me.
*  Last point. So there was a whole section in the movie about the meat ruining your gut microbiota.
*  Um, and they, I think we're referencing two very, very low carb diet studies that did show a decrease
*  in key species of protective bacteria and also in butyrate production. So this is also one of my
*  questions about carnivore or, you know, super low carb diet for a long period of time. But again,
*  context is everything. That's not necessarily the effects of meat. That's the effects of not eating
*  plant foods. And there was a good study, slide 27, Jamie, that really established this. So it was
*  2019 study in the, in plus one. So it's free, full text access. You can go look it up,
*  gut microbiome response to a modern Paleolithic diet in a Western lifestyle context. So they took,
*  I think they were Italians and they had one group that was on a, um,
*  they put a group of them on what's called modern Paleo diet, you know, so obviously we can't
*  recreate the Paleo diet, but just what we all talk about when we say Paleo and they found,
*  quote, an unexpectedly high degree of biodiversity in modern Paleo diet subjects, which well
*  approximates that of traditional populations like the Inuit, Hadza, Matzis in Peru. So they found
*  that eating a Paleo diet made your gut microbiota look like a hunter gatherer microbiota.
*  And by Paleo diet, what we mean is meats and vegetables.
*  Meat, non-starchy vegetables, nuts and seeds, fruits and starchy tubers like sweet potatoes.
*  So people who ate that diet had a microbiota that resembled hunter gathers,
*  which have the best microbiota. Like studies have shown that their microbiota is what we want to
*  have. So this study shows it's not about the meat. It's about what you eat with the meat.
*  Which only makes a difference.
*  Which only makes sense.
*  Because we know what feeds the microbiota, fiber.
*  Is there anything in this movie that they got right to end on a positive note?
*  Yeah. I mean, I think I agree with them on the problem. Like I think feedlot,
*  CAFO, beef and livestock production is not the way to go. I think it can be environmentally
*  destructive. It's just from there, where they went with the solution is not where I go. They
*  go to plant-based vegan diet. I go to regenerative, holistically managed livestock. Shifting the food
*  production to smaller scale or at least shifting the method of plant production so it's less
*  industrialized and doing things that actually can improve soil quality and sequester carbon
*  from the atmosphere rather than scaling up more industry and more technology.
*  Well, I hope this acts as a guide for people that are confused by this. And I hope people
*  recommend this because this is probably as thorough a breakdown as anybody's ever done
*  on that documentary. And I just wish people would stop doing this. I really wish they would just
*  follow the actual science, even if it's inconvenient to their dogma. And it's a real
*  problem when people don't. It really is because it's confusing for folks and there's a lot of
*  people who suffer health consequences because of that confusion. Well, it's a shame too. And now
*  we talked about this with Joel. Like I think actually vegans and people who are recommending
*  what we're talking about now have a lot in common. You know, we want better methods of food production.
*  We care about the environment. We care about animals and animal welfare. We just reach
*  different conclusions about, you know, from looking at those problems. And we probably
*  have more in common with the average American or person in the world who's just not even thinking
*  about it at all as eating processed and refined crap and doesn't care. We have much more in common
*  with the vegans. The difference is these people, like the people that made this documentary and
*  like Joel, they want to ignore evidence of flies in the face of what they're trying to promote.
*  And they do it with really frustrating and deceptive methods. And that's what I thought
*  when I watched this film. It was hard for me to watch the whole thing. I'd watched a little clips
*  of it before and I kind of had gotten a review of it and knew what it was all about. But watching
*  the whole thing, like sitting there going, what the fuck, man? Come on. I was on an airplane. I
*  told you this before because I knew I had to be in an environment where I couldn't just run away and
*  turn it off. But I was like laughing out loud in parts and kind of like wanting to shout at others.
*  The boner part?
*  The peanut butter sandwich.
*  Cause you knew the difference.
*  Cause I knew right off the bat. There were just a lot of things that were funny, but sad.
*  Well, Chris, thank you for doing this and James will have you on if you really want to do this.
*  He's game.
*  Okay. Well, after this breakdown, I wonder how game he's still going to be.
*  Yeah. I wonder how game I'm going to be.
*  Well, you let me know, okay? Cause you're the only guy for this job.
*  Seven and a half combined hours on this.
*  Listen, you're doing the world a gigantic service and I truly,
*  truly appreciate it. So please tell people one more time, the website,
*  Cressor.co slash game changers for all the references, bibliography studies and the show notes.
*  Chris Cressor on Twitter and Instagram. Why do I say Twitter that way? Twitter,
*  and Instagram as well. Same thing. Thank you, Chris. Really appreciate it. Thank you. Bye everybody.
