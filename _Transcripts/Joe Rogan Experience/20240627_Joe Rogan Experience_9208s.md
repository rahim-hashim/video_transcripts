*  Changes your day, right? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=20.0s)]
*  Yeah, it makes the day better. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=22.0s)]
*  I don't know, I literally don't know how you do this. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=23.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=25.0s)]
*  You're like, oh, it's gonna, you're gonna feel so good, dude. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=26.0s)]
*  I get to the club, I'm literally falling asleep, I'm sore. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=28.0s)]
*  You guys start taking vitamins. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=31.0s)]
*  I take some vitamins. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=34.0s)]
*  Do you? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=35.0s)]
*  What are you taking? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=36.0s)]
*  Take vitamin B. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=37.0s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=39.0s)]
*  D. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=40.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=41.0s)]
*  Pals. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=42.0s)]
*  C. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=43.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=44.0s)]
*  Take some zinc. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=45.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=46.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=47.0s)]
*  What, you're getting like a multivitamin? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=48.0s)]
*  Yeah, whatever the fucking CVS thing is. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=49.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=50.0s)]
*  Those yellow, you know what I'm talking about? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=51.0s)]
*  It's probably been on the shelf since the 70s. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=52.0s)]
*  Fuck it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=54.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=55.0s)]
*  I don't think they're doing anything. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=56.0s)]
*  Zinc makes you cum harder. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=57.0s)]
*  I haven't noticed a big result. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=58.0s)]
*  Zinc is difficult to get into your bloodstream. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=63.0s)]
*  You need an ionophore. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=65.0s)]
*  If you're gonna take zinc, you need something like quercetin. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=66.0s)]
*  Fuck, I know I need an ionophore. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=69.0s)]
*  Yeah, ionophore's super important. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=70.0s)]
*  What's that? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=72.0s)]
*  Something that allows, I don't wanna fuck this up, but I think it allows ions to get [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=73.0s)]
*  into your bloodstream easier. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=77.0s)]
*  It just allows things like zinc to get into your cells easier. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=79.0s)]
*  I'm not, yeah, I'm not close to worrying about shit like that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=83.0s)]
*  I'm working on bread. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=86.0s)]
*  Cut down bread. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=87.0s)]
*  Bread's tough, dude. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=88.0s)]
*  I'll worry about ionophores in a couple years. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=89.0s)]
*  Bread's tough. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=93.0s)]
*  Boy, when you're sitting at a restaurant and they bring out the bread with the butter, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=94.0s)]
*  ooh, it smells good. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=98.0s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=99.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean this weekend I ate at Denny's and Waffle House. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=100.0s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=104.0s)]
*  Both were pretty good. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=105.0s)]
*  Bro, at two o'clock in the morning, I'll fuck a waffle with some sausages. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=106.0s)]
*  It's hard to beat. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=110.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=111.0s)]
*  You know what I used to love in LA? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=112.0s)]
*  Roscoe's. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=113.0s)]
*  Chicken and waffles. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=114.0s)]
*  God damn, it's good. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=115.0s)]
*  It's the best. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=116.0s)]
*  With collard greens. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=117.0s)]
*  Oh, I don't know about that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=118.0s)]
*  Do you like collard greens? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=119.0s)]
*  I fucking love them. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=120.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=121.0s)]
*  I guess I haven't had them. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=122.0s)]
*  Especially when you're at, it's the combination of flavors. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=123.0s)]
*  The chicken, the waffles, the syrup with the butter. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=125.0s)]
*  The syrup and the butter, too much syrup and too much butter. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=129.0s)]
*  Just let's fucking go. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=132.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=133.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=134.0s)]
*  When you're eating, you're like, mwah, mwah. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=135.0s)]
*  As you're eating, you're like, mwah, mwah. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=137.0s)]
*  God, I used to love Roscoe's. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=139.0s)]
*  Yeah, I just ate a waffle, like I said. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=141.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=144.0s)]
*  This, two days ago, I was eating a waffle. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=145.0s)]
*  Waffles are good. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=147.0s)]
*  It's pretty wonderful. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=148.0s)]
*  Waffles are good. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=149.0s)]
*  Waffles with butter and syrup are pretty fucking good. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=150.0s)]
*  Sucks that they're bad. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=152.0s)]
*  It's a crazy way to start the day. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=153.0s)]
*  I did find some protein waffles. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=155.0s)]
*  What are they called? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=158.0s)]
*  Is it Viking waffles? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=159.0s)]
*  See if you can find that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=161.0s)]
*  I think there's a company called Viking Waffles. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=162.0s)]
*  They make protein waffles that are low carb. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=164.0s)]
*  And then I would use butter and then sugar-free syrup. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=168.0s)]
*  It's pretty fucking close. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=173.0s)]
*  That's it, Viking waffles. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=174.0s)]
*  21 grams of protein, 3 grams of sugar, 5 grams of carbs. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=176.0s)]
*  200 calories. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=180.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=181.0s)]
*  And they're good. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=182.0s)]
*  They fucking taste like a real waffle. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=183.0s)]
*  People love Vikings. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=185.0s)]
*  Who doesn't love Vikings? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=187.0s)]
*  Fucking Irish people. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=188.0s)]
*  The people that were out on the shore. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=189.0s)]
*  They were out raped for 500 years. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=191.0s)]
*  Bro, they fucked everybody up forever. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=193.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=195.0s)]
*  The reason why the people in Iceland are so good at Strongman competitions. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=196.0s)]
*  You know, those guys like the guy at the mountain from Game of Thrones? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=200.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's freaks. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=202.0s)]
*  Where do those genes come from? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=203.0s)]
*  Yeah, they need an eruption up there. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=205.0s)]
*  We need to get rid of these guys. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=206.0s)]
*  A little bit of a volcano. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=208.0s)]
*  We can't have these guys. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=209.0s)]
*  This is my Irish ancestry coming through. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=210.0s)]
*  We got to get rid of these fuckers. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=212.0s)]
*  Yeah, they fucked the world up for so long. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=214.0s)]
*  That show, Vikings, you ever watch that show? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=218.0s)]
*  No, I heard it's great. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=220.0s)]
*  Fucking great. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=221.0s)]
*  I was afraid it was going to be like, because they did, like women. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=222.0s)]
*  Oh, they kill everybody. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=226.0s)]
*  All right, good. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=227.0s)]

*  No, no, no. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=229.0s)]
*  I mean like the badass kick-ass woman characters. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=230.0s)]
*  Do they have that? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=232.0s)]
*  They have a couple. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=233.0s)]
*  That usually takes me out of a... [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=234.0s)]
*  No, no, they're realistic. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=235.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=236.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=240.0s)]
*  Ah, the old Conor McGregor woman. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=241.0s)]
*  I don't love it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=244.0s)]

*  It looked like shit, dude. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=258.0s)]
*  They were like five, six. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=259.0s)]
*  They were not these giant... [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=262.0s)]
*  Well, how the fuck does the mountain come from? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=264.0s)]
*  Where does he come from then? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=266.0s)]
*  They... [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=268.0s)]
*  How do you get a seven foot tall, 350 pound dude? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=269.0s)]
*  I think they were wearing like felt shirts. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=271.0s)]
*  They looked like fucking dickheads. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=272.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=273.0s)]
*  They look like hobbits, dude. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=274.0s)]
*  What is that? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=275.0s)]
*  That's not real. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=276.0s)]
*  I mean, that's not them, but... [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=277.0s)]
*  That's not real. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=278.0s)]
*  That's a Ren fair. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=279.0s)]
*  Look at that fucking kid. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=280.0s)]
*  Those are cosplaying. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=281.0s)]
*  Those people are cosplaying people. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=282.0s)]
*  Oh, jeez. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=283.0s)]
*  Don't do that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=284.0s)]
*  Don't zoom in on his eyes. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=285.0s)]
*  That's not fair to that little fella. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=286.0s)]
*  That's what this puzzle looked like? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=287.0s)]
*  No. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=288.0s)]
*  This is... [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=289.0s)]
*  They've been glorified because they were... [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=290.0s)]
*  Do we have an accurate depiction of what they actually looked like? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=291.0s)]
*  I don't think there was... [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=292.0s)]
*  Click on that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=293.0s)]
*  I mean, nobody took a picture. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=294.0s)]
*  What real Vikings wore? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=295.0s)]

*  See it? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=298.0s)]
*  Right here. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=299.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=300.0s)]
*  So click on that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=301.0s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=302.0s)]
*  According to archaeologists... [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=303.0s)]
*  I used to love archaeologists. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=304.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=305.0s)]
*  Popular culture gets it wrong. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=306.0s)]
*  Todd Mcgram Hancock. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=307.0s)]

*  Todd Mcgram Hancock. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=315.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=316.0s)]
*  It says, the appearance of these infamous travelers, warriors, and mostly farmers. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=317.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=323.0s)]
*  So what do they look like? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=324.0s)]
*  There's not going to be a picture. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=325.0s)]
*  It's just going to explain it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=326.0s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of words. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=327.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=328.0s)]
*  Words. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=329.0s)]
*  But what does it say? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=330.0s)]
*  It says, variety... [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=331.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=332.0s)]
*  Varieties and form, material, and styles are used to mark both gender, rank, and local [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=333.0s)]
*  identity. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=340.0s)]
*  It says, Marianne Vedler, an archaeologist at the University of Oslo's Museum of Cultural [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=342.0s)]
*  History, maintains... [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=347.36s)]
*  Oh, I studied Viking textiles. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=348.36s)]
*  TV shows and films could make use of this to tell better stories. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=350.76s)]
*  As for the male warrior caricature, historians doubt they actually wore cartoonish horned [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=355.16s)]
*  helmets in battle. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=359.24s)]
*  Oh, come on. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=360.24s)]
*  I know. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=361.24s)]
*  It's disappointing. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=362.24s)]
*  Those have appeared in art from this era. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=363.24s)]
*  In fact, only one preserved Viking helmet has materialized in Scandinavia, and it was [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=365.84s)]
*  horn-free. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=370.71999999999997s)]
*  Only one? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=371.71999999999997s)]
*  They only found one Viking helmet? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  Archaeologists found portions of Viking helmets in Denmark, but their popularity remains unknown. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=376.91999999999996s)]
*  Similarly, we know of one intact suit of chainmail, which appeared with the sole surviving helmet. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=381.76s)]
*  One fucking suit of chainmail and one helmet. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=390.12s)]
*  This was likely worn exclusively by elites and professional warriors despite its common [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=394.16s)]
*  appearance in mainstream depictions. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=398.4s)]
*  They rocked a reverse mullet. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=400.68s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=402.44s)]
*  What's a reverse mullet? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=403.44s)]
*  Long up front? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=405.4s)]
*  Party up front? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=406.4s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=407.4s)]
*  What's a reverse mullet? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=408.4s)]
*  How does that look? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=409.4s)]
*  I guess. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=410.4s)]
*  What is a reverse mullet? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=411.4s)]
*  So a reverse mullet means long on top and short in the back? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=417.08s)]
*  Bad explanation here. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=421.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=423.08000000000004s)]
*  So a fade? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=424.08000000000004s)]
*  There you go. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=425.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=426.08000000000004s)]
*  It's possibly tied to a knot in the back of the head. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=427.08000000000004s)]
*  The knot may have been decorated with colored tape which is sprayed into the hair. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=428.84000000000003s)]
*  The woman also wore a bonnet. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=432.48s)]
*  This is a lot of guessing. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=433.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=434.96000000000004s)]
*  If you have one helmet and one piece of chainmail. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=435.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, that's all guessing. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=438.32000000000005s)]
*  You're doing a lot of guessing. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=439.32000000000005s)]
*  Isn't that wild though? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=440.32000000000005s)]
*  They only got one helmet? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=441.32000000000005s)]
*  That's it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=443.56s)]
*  That's a good look. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=444.56s)]
*  All right, they got it in the show. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=445.56s)]
*  Nice. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=446.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=447.56s)]
*  But yeah, they gave them like cool shit. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=448.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=450.6s)]
*  That is pretty cool. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=451.6s)]
*  Viking hairstyles. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=453.6s)]
*  Did they really tattoo their faces up? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=454.6s)]
*  I've ... [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=457.6s)]
*  Because they did on the show. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=458.6s)]
*  Obviously, there's no way to tell. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=459.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=461.6s)]
*  How do you guess? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=462.6s)]
*  They just keep making them so cool. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=463.6s)]
*  Yeah, they make them real cool. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=464.6s)]
*  And they're a bunch of murderers and you like them. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=465.6s)]
*  Yeah, I don't cheer for them. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=467.6s)]

*  Because of your culture. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=470.6s)]

*  Really? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=475.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=476.6s)]
*  Overrated. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=477.6s)]
*  Everything about them is rumors. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=478.6s)]
*  They're like, oh, they discovered America first. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=480.6s)]
*  It's like, no. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=481.6s)]

*  Yeah, they shot people's arms off. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=516.6s)]
*  They didn't give them enough gold. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=518.6s)]
*  They dashed babies' heads on the rocks. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=520.6s)]

*  But people were awful back then. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=526.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=529.6s)]
*  Just think about how awful people were when the movies in 1950 just smacked women around. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=530.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=534.6s)]

*  He's like, she has to get the last word. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=542.6s)]
*  ... they have to get the last word, and even after you let them get the last word, that's [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=544.6s)]
*  not enough. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=547.6s)]
*  It's actually pretty good. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=549.6s)]
*  I can't do it. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=551.6s)]
*  Connery. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=553.6s)]
*  I have a fucking zen in my mouth, which makes it harder ... [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=554.6s)]
*  It fucks you up. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=558.6s)]
*  ... harder to do that accent. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=559.6s)]
*  There it is a little. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=561.6s)]
*  Oh, you were just in Scotland. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=562.6s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=565.6s)]
*  Bro, I was in Scotland, and I was at this place, and there's a fucking stone circle [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=566.6s)]
*  that's older than Stonehenge. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=571.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=573.6s)]

*  I don't know. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=575.6s)]
*  You can just go stand on it. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=576.6s)]
*  You can touch it. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=577.6s)]
*  They don't even protect it. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=578.6s)]
*  It's just laying out there in front of this dude's house. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=580.6s)]
*  It's literally in front of this dude's house. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=583.6s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=585.6s)]
*  It's like 50 feet in front. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=586.6s)]
*  You can throw a rock and hit it. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=587.6s)]
*  How old was it? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=588.6s)]
*  5,000 plus years old? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=589.6s)]
*  Stone circle. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=590.6s)]
*  No idea who made it. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=591.6s)]
*  They think. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=592.6s)]
*  They think druids. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=593.6s)]
*  Maybe druids. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=594.6s)]

*  There's no one there. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=598.6s)]
*  It's like I kind of discovered it. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=599.6s)]
*  Cut off their arms, dude. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=600.6s)]

*  Low clouds, and the hill. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=608.6s)]
*  They're not really mountains. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=609.6s)]
*  They're kind of like, you know, mountains. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=610.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=611.6s)]

*  I'll get in. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=632.6s)]
*  It's jamming. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=633.6s)]
*  So you take a look at it. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=634.6s)]
*  Have you heard that the mountain range of like the Appalachians is this, it bleeds over? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=635.6s)]
*  It was connected? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=640.6s)]
*  To your home. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=641.6s)]
*  That's pretty cool. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=643.6s)]
*  What's that jamming? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=644.6s)]
*  The Appalachians, the same mountain ranges, the same mountains over there. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=645.6s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=649.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=650.6s)]
*  It goes across the ocean? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=651.6s)]
*  Well, I mean, when they were connected. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=652.6s)]
*  Oh, like during the panspermia days? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=654.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=656.6s)]
*  What? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=657.6s)]
*  Panspermia. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=658.6s)]
*  Oh, that's the wrong one. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=659.6s)]
*  Pangea. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=660.6s)]
*  You know what panspermia is? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=661.6s)]
*  Panspermia is the theory that asteroids create, that seeded life on Earth. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=662.6s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=668.6s)]
*  Like spores and amino acids were in asteroids. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=669.6s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=672.6s)]
*  Trying to get to be close and just make something gay. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=673.6s)]
*  I know I did. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=676.6s)]
*  I turned it into sperm. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=677.6s)]
*  Check out that picture I sent you, Jamie. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=679.6s)]
*  There's another one. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=682.6s)]
*  This one might be better. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=683.6s)]
*  I didn't zoom in as much on this one. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=685.6s)]
*  There's the first one. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=687.6s)]
*  Look at this guy. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=689.6s)]
*  Oh, damn. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=690.6s)]
*  Just wandering around. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=691.6s)]
*  I had to zoom in on him. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=692.6s)]
*  That's why. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=693.6s)]
*  Look at the second one. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=694.6s)]
*  It's probably less shitty. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=695.6s)]
*  Oh, eat me and eat on. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=696.6s)]
*  What's that about? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=697.6s)]
*  That's why it worked. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=698.6s)]
*  What have you done? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=699.6s)]
*  That dude was just chilling. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=704.6s)]
*  That thing's huge. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=705.6s)]
*  Huge. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=706.6s)]
*  Big old stag. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=707.6s)]
*  Did you want to shoot him? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=708.6s)]
*  100%. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=710.6s)]
*  I was looking at his vitals. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=711.6s)]
*  I was drawing back. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=713.6s)]
*  Really? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=714.6s)]
*  About 90 yards. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=715.6s)]
*  Oh, were you hunting when you saw him? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=716.6s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=718.6s)]
*  I was just wandering around. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=719.6s)]
*  I don't think you're allowed to bow hunt in Scotland. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=720.6s)]
*  I don't think they allow you to bow hunt in the UK. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=724.6s)]
*  Oh, it's for animals. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=727.6s)]
*  Yeah, I just don't think they're educated. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=730.6s)]
*  They're not educated about modern compound bows and modern broad heads. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=733.6s)]
*  If someone's good at a bow and arrow, that's just as ethical as shooting them with a rifle. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=738.6s)]
*  Maybe more so. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=744.6s)]

*  razor sharp broad head at the end of it, just passes right through their body. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=760.6s)]
*  Next thing you know, they're spraying blood. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=765.6s)]

*  What'd you get? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=772.6s)]
*  I got an elk. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=773.6s)]

*  And they have to shoot them. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1240.72s)]
*  Because they have no predators. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1242.72s)]
*  Really? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1244.72s)]
*  No predators. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1245.72s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what the fuck used to kill kangaroos. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1246.72s)]
*  Maybe the Tasmanian tigers, maybe the thylacine. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1249.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1253.72s)]
*  Which they think still exist. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1254.72s)]
*  They think they're still out there. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1256.72s)]
*  How many? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1258.72s)]
*  No, how'd they die? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1259.72s)]
*  People killed them. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1261.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1262.72s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1263.72s)]
*  I mean, the last one was in a zoo. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1264.72s)]
*  The last live one that was in a zoo. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1266.72s)]
*  They were dumb fucking. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1268.72s)]
*  They were dumb. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1269.72s)]
*  Well, it was time to go for those. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1270.72s)]
*  They're weird looking. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1272.72s)]
*  It's like a strange dog looking kind of creature. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1273.72s)]
*  They're kind of cool. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1277.72s)]
*  And they have giant mouths. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1278.72s)]
*  When they yawn, open their mouths, they're like, what the fuck? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1279.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's got like a fucking alligator head. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1282.72s)]
*  Yeah, giant fucking mouth. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1284.72s)]
*  They think they have them still in remote areas, though. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1285.72s)]
*  Because there's so much unexplored area and people spotted them. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1289.72s)]
*  What, in like, Van Diemen's land? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1292.72s)]
*  You know. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1294.72s)]
*  Oh, they're marsupials? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1295.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1297.72s)]
*  Yeah, in that wild, they had a pouch. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1298.72s)]
*  A lot of marsupials over there, which is also odd. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1300.72s)]
*  What a cool looking fucking animal. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1302.72s)]
*  Yeah, take it back. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1304.72s)]
*  That's a good guy. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1305.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1306.72s)]
*  They think they've found them. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1307.72s)]
*  So Google thylacine spotted. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1308.72s)]
*  Spotted in Australia. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1313.72s)]
*  Sightings, 2021. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1314.72s)]
*  There you go. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1316.72s)]
*  Click on that. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1317.72s)]
*  Yeah, they think they've seen them. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1318.72s)]
*  Tasmanian tiger-like animal caught on video to suburban street. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1322.72s)]
*  Yeah, they think they still exist, man. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1325.72s)]
*  Like a bunch of people have apparently spotted them in different places. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1328.72s)]
*  To the point where I had a biologist on the podcast who was explaining that there's multiple different scientists that are trying to find these things. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1332.72s)]
*  They have camera traps set up and shit. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1343.72s)]
*  And there's enough sightings that people are pretty sure that they're real. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1345.72s)]
*  That they actually still exist. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1350.72s)]
*  Which totally makes sense, because that area is so big. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1352.72s)]
*  Imagine being the poor fucking guys that got exiled there. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1355.72s)]
*  There's just those fucking animals around. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1358.72s)]
*  Yeah, when they exiled them, they took the prisoners from England. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1361.72s)]
*  What'd they do? Just drop them off and say, get out of there? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1366.72s)]
*  Yeah, like political prisoners would have to go too. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1368.72s)]
*  Yeah, so there's a bunch of Irish dudes that had to go to Tasmania. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1370.72s)]
*  And you're just stuck there. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1374.72s)]
*  I mean, they escaped. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1376.72s)]
*  They got off pretty easy. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1377.72s)]
*  I'm sure it wasn't easy. I'm sure you died trying. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1380.72s)]
*  It's fucking beautiful, though. The weather's amazing. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1382.72s)]
*  They're probably like, fuck England. This place rules. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1385.72s)]
*  No, it's just you. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1388.72s)]
*  Oh. Just by yourself? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1390.72s)]
*  It's like a fucking house. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1392.72s)]
*  Well, how'd the girls get over there? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1394.72s)]
*  They got some babes. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1395.72s)]
*  How'd they get over there? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1396.72s)]
*  They got some local babes. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1397.72s)]
*  Was it local babes? They must have imported some babes. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1398.72s)]
*  Those are white girls. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1401.72s)]
*  Yeah, women got sent, too. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1403.72s)]
*  Oh, bad girls. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1404.72s)]
*  Whores. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1405.72s)]
*  Bad girls. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1406.72s)]
*  Whores and drunks. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1407.72s)]
*  Do you know that that's the Australian accent? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1409.72s)]
*  What? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1411.72s)]
*  The Australian accent is essentially a drunk English accent. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1412.72s)]
*  Yeah. It's pretty great. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1414.72s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1416.72s)]
*  I think they could only trade rum. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1417.72s)]
*  That was their main... [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1419.72s)]
*  That's all they had? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1420.72s)]
*  Yeah, like most... [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1421.72s)]
*  I think that's how it was in the Caribbean, too. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1422.72s)]
*  I think they had rum, mate. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1424.72s)]
*  Yeah, they just had rum, and they're like, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1425.72s)]
*  hey, fuck, I don't know. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1426.72s)]
*  Fucking kangaroo, get out of here, fucker. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1428.72s)]
*  Ah, fuck. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1430.72s)]
*  Literally. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1432.72s)]
*  Just caught on a walk, you get attacked. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1433.72s)]
*  It's a drunk version of the English accent. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1434.72s)]
*  English accent's gay. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1437.72s)]
*  You don't like it? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1439.72s)]
*  Not all of them. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1440.72s)]
*  The proper. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1442.72s)]
*  Liverpool's great accent. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1443.72s)]
*  Liverpool's pretty cool. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1444.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1445.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1446.72s)]
*  Scousers. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1447.72s)]
*  The fucking... [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1448.72s)]
*  Paddy the Batty. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1449.72s)]
*  Paddy the Batty's great. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1450.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1451.72s)]
*  Yeah, we'll see. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1452.72s)]
*  He's a fun guy. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1453.72s)]
*  He's a fun guy. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1454.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1455.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1456.72s)]
*  The Liverpool people, they're fucking fun. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1457.72s)]
*  When's he fighting again? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1459.72s)]
*  He's fighting Tony Ferguson, I believe in two weeks, right? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1460.72s)]
*  Yeah, in the next UFC. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1463.72s)]
*  Tony Ferguson's fun. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1464.72s)]
*  Tony Ferguson's got some miles. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1465.72s)]
*  He's a fun guy. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1467.72s)]
*  He's got some miles on that body. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1468.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1470.72s)]
*  He's been training with David Goggins. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1471.72s)]
*  Oh, I saw that. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1473.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1475.72s)]
*  That's kind of... [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1476.72s)]
*  Goggins is just fucking them up. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1477.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1479.72s)]
*  I wonder how good that is for you to run 100 miles. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1480.72s)]
*  We're going to find out. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1483.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1484.72s)]
*  You can't be good. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1485.72s)]
*  I'm no expert on fitness. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1486.72s)]
*  Well, fitness is important, but sparring is important. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1488.72s)]
*  But sparring is very important, too. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1492.72s)]
*  And timing is important, and training, and technique, and drilling, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1494.72s)]
*  and being prepared to do specific things. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1498.72s)]
*  It's just, when fighters get older, they can't move as good. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1501.72s)]
*  There's a bunch of shit that you don't see. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1506.72s)]
*  Right? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1508.72s)]
*  They might have knee things that you don't see. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1509.72s)]
*  They might have back things that you don't see. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1511.72s)]
*  So they look the same. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1513.72s)]
*  There's apparently a video of Tony Ferguson when he used to enter the octagon, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1514.72s)]
*  and how he used to move versus now. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1521.72s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1523.72s)]
*  Did he do that crawl thing? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1524.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1525.72s)]
*  Did he do that? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1526.72s)]
*  But it's also the contrast to the way his body moves. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1527.72s)]
*  Dude, in the old days, when Tony Ferguson was on this undefeated run, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1530.72s)]
*  he was one of the baddest fucking men on the planet. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1535.72s)]
*  The fact that him and Khabib never got to fight is a real fucking tragedy. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1537.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1540.72s)]
*  Because when he was in his prime, that's when he fell, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1541.72s)]
*  just tripped on some wires backstage doing an interview, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1545.72s)]
*  and ripped his fucking knee apart. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1549.72s)]
*  Just completely ripped his knee apart. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1551.72s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1553.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's what happened. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1554.72s)]
*  That's why the fight got canceled. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1555.72s)]
*  And Al Iaquinta wound up fighting Khabib. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1557.72s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1561.72s)]
*  It's like he's just walking along, and he trips. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1562.72s)]
*  And his knee just explodes. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1567.72s)]
*  I mean, like severe, catastrophic knee injury. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1569.72s)]
*  How did he ever get everything fucking surgically reattached, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1573.72s)]
*  months and months of rehab? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1577.72s)]
*  And he came back, and he beat Anthony Pettis, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1579.72s)]
*  and he looked really fucking good. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1581.72s)]
*  But, you know. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1583.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1585.72s)]
*  There's only, an elite fighter can only operate at their highest level [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1586.72s)]
*  for so many years. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1591.72s)]
*  There's only a window of time where you can operate at the highest RPMs. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1593.72s)]
*  So here it is. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1599.72s)]
*  This is from 2015. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1601.72s)]
*  This is him moving around when he got into the octagon. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1604.72s)]
*  This is 2019, still looking pretty good. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1607.72s)]
*  2022, a little slower. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1611.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1614.72s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1615.72s)]
*  Quite a bit difference. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1616.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1617.72s)]
*  That's them knees are fucking feeling it now. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1618.72s)]
*  Now he's feeling it, right? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1620.72s)]
*  They're just moving different, and they're saying, sad. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1622.72s)]
*  And now here we are, 2023. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1626.72s)]
*  That Chandler knockout was rough. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1629.72s)]
*  The kick? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1631.72s)]
*  You got a front kick right into the jaw. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1632.72s)]
*  There's a photo of Chandler's foot connected on Tony's face. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1634.72s)]
*  It's like a fucking dolly painting. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1638.72s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1640.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1641.72s)]
*  It's wild to look at, like, what happens to someone's face [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1642.72s)]
*  when a foot impacts their fucking jaw? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1644.72s)]
*  Just this. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1648.72s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1650.72s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1652.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1654.72s)]
*  Rough sport. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1655.72s)]
*  It is a rough sport. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1656.72s)]
*  I will say this about the cold plunge, I'm still cold. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1658.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1660.72s)]
*  And just ask him this. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1661.72s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1662.72s)]
*  Bro, how crazy is that? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1663.72s)]

*  Like he's... [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1670.72s)]
*  Like they got him out of a glacier like he was frozen in the glacier. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1672.72s)]
*  I mean, that's a perfect... [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1676.72s)]
*  And look at Chandler's fucking quads. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1679.72s)]
*  Imagine how much power is in that. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1681.72s)]

*  just exploding on your face. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=1689.72s)]

*  He's like, yeah, it's worth it. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2464.12s)]
*  I could be wrong. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2466.12s)]
*  They might have got him on FaceTime. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2468.12s)]
*  Somebody might have got him on a jacking off on FaceTime. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2470.12s)]
*  How do they do that? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2472.12s)]
*  They say they're a girl. They don't show you who they are. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2474.12s)]
*  They keep their screen black. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2476.12s)]

*  It's a funny story. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2490.52s)]
*  He's told that story before. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2492.52s)]
*  It'll help his career. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2494.52s)]
*  That's the thing about being a comic. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2496.52s)]
*  It's not like being a journalist. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2498.52s)]
*  If you're a journalist [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2500.52s)]
*  and you get busted [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2502.52s)]

*  you're in real trouble. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2506.52s)]
*  That Jeffrey Tubin guy, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2508.52s)]
*  he lost his job. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2510.92s)]
*  I think they brought him back on CNN, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2512.92s)]
*  but everybody just kept calling him the jerk-off guy. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2514.92s)]
*  Then he went on Patrick Beck David's podcast [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2516.92s)]
*  and he was defending the vaccine [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2518.92s)]
*  like it was a religious doctrine. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2520.92s)]
*  It was wild. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2522.92s)]
*  This guy was so scared of being canceled. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2524.92s)]
*  Everything was [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2526.92s)]
*  completely by the book. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2528.92s)]
*  Whatever the narrative is [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2530.92s)]
*  that the mainstream media is pushing, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2532.92s)]
*  this guy was all in [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2534.92s)]
*  with no questions asked. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2536.92s)]
*  He's jacked off. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2539.32s)]
*  That's just how it is. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2541.32s)]
*  That's just how it is. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2543.32s)]
*  If you're one of those guys, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2545.32s)]
*  it's fucking dangerous [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2547.32s)]
*  if you're one of those guys. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2549.32s)]
*  You don't want them coming for you again. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2551.32s)]
*  You already got caught jacking off. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2553.32s)]
*  Getting caught jacking off is brutal. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2555.32s)]
*  That's a tough one. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2557.32s)]
*  On a fucking Zoom, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2559.32s)]
*  the fact that you can't stop [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2561.32s)]
*  jerking off while you're talking [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2563.32s)]
*  about the election [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2565.32s)]
*  That just means the whole time [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2567.7200000000003s)]
*  he was talking in the back of his head [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2569.7200000000003s)]
*  That's a real person [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2571.7200000000003s)]
*  as opposed to what these people portray themselves [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2573.7200000000003s)]
*  in the media. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2575.7200000000003s)]
*  Moral authorities [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2577.7200000000003s)]
*  and these experts [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2579.7200000000003s)]
*  and these people of substantial reason. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2581.7200000000003s)]
*  They're not that. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2583.7200000000003s)]
*  They're fucking weirdos who are being confined by this job [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2585.7200000000003s)]
*  and they're boxed into a very specific [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2587.7200000000003s)]
*  way of behaving and talking. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2589.7200000000003s)]
*  They put makeup on you [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2591.7200000000003s)]
*  and they sit you in front of a camera [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2593.7200000000003s)]
*  and you pretend you're smarter than everybody else. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2596.12s)]
*  And when those people go on [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2598.12s)]
*  a show where they get questioned [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2600.12s)]
*  like that guy went on the [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2602.12s)]
*  Patrick Bette David podcast [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2604.12s)]
*  you just see who they really are. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2606.12s)]
*  It's like, oh, you're just some guy [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2608.12s)]
*  and this is what you do. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2610.12s)]
*  And they work for both. They work for CNN and Fox. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2612.12s)]
*  And change their...they're like girlfriends. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2614.12s)]
*  Whoever I'm dating, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2616.12s)]
*  that's my personality. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2618.12s)]
*  Well, didn't Tucker Carlson start at CNN? [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2620.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2622.12s)]
*  He's buck wild now. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2624.52s)]
*  His laugh's wild. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2626.52s)]
*  I met him for the first time. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2628.52s)]
*  Very nice guy. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2630.52s)]
*  Like seemed genuine. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2634.52s)]
*  Shook his hand. How you doing? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2636.52s)]
*  We talk. Chit chat. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2638.52s)]
*  Everything I've seen of him, he seems [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2640.52s)]
*  cool. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2642.52s)]
*  I wouldn't describe him as cool. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2644.52s)]
*  This is what he is. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2646.52s)]
*  He's odd. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2648.52s)]
*  There's no question about it. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2650.52s)]
*  He's odd. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2652.92s)]
*  The way he laughs is odd. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2654.92s)]
*  The way he communicates is odd. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2656.92s)]
*  But I don't think he's a bad guy. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2658.92s)]
*  I think what he does [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2660.92s)]
*  is very important for the most part. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2662.92s)]
*  Some of the stuff is like [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2664.92s)]
*  when he found the dude who blew Obama. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2666.92s)]
*  Like, yo! [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2668.92s)]
*  What are you doing here? [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2670.92s)]
*  What is this? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2672.92s)]
*  This is the same guy that's exposing [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2674.92s)]
*  fraud in the CIA. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2676.92s)]
*  This is the same guy that wants to release the Kennedy files. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2678.92s)]
*  This guy blew the president. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2681.32s)]
*  Even if he did. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2683.32s)]
*  Who fucking cares? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2685.32s)]
*  I kind of want to know. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2687.32s)]
*  But who cares? [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2689.32s)]
*  I'm kind of happy you did it. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2691.32s)]
*  That's big news. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2693.32s)]
*  I know. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2695.32s)]
*  But is it shocking? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2697.32s)]
*  If you're a guy and you're running for president and you're gay, you're not telling anybody. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2699.32s)]
*  Not in this day and age. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2701.32s)]
*  There's just way too many people that wouldn't. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2703.32s)]
*  They would think you're a freak. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2705.32s)]
*  There's way too many people that unfairly [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2707.32s)]
*  associate gay people with some other kind of perversion as well. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2709.7200000000003s)]
*  They don't just think this is just [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2711.7200000000003s)]
*  how you like women. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2713.7200000000003s)]
*  This guy likes men. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2715.7200000000003s)]
*  We should all be free. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2717.7200000000003s)]
*  And clearly, it is how he is. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2719.7200000000003s)]
*  This is not some wacky thing [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2721.7200000000003s)]
*  like being addicted to gambling. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2723.7200000000003s)]
*  This is like a thing that is in your genes. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2725.7200000000003s)]
*  And we need to accept it. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2727.7200000000003s)]
*  If we're going to be a kind, compassionate society, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2729.7200000000003s)]

*  I don't know, I don't know. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2735.7200000000003s)]
*  But there's a lot of people [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2738.12s)]
*  that automatically will [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2740.12s)]
*  associate homosexuality [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2742.12s)]
*  with some kind of perversion [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2744.12s)]
*  for whatever unfortunate reason. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2746.12s)]
*  Well, it's because the reason is because it's guys [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2748.12s)]
*  fucking each other in the butt. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2750.12s)]
*  So that throws people off. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2752.12s)]
*  That throws people off a little bit. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2754.12s)]
*  But that should be completely legal. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2756.12s)]
*  It gets lumped into [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2758.12s)]
*  pedophilia. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2760.12s)]
*  And then whenever there's a pedophile [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2762.12s)]
*  that happens to be gay, then people are like [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2764.12s)]
*  see? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2766.52s)]
*  But there's just a lot of pedophiles. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2768.52s)]
*  You know? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2770.52s)]
*  That's the creepiest thing. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2772.52s)]
*  I got sent a documentary last night [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2774.52s)]
*  about this lady who fucked [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2776.52s)]
*  a 12 year old student. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2778.52s)]
*  And she got pregnant. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2780.52s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2782.52s)]
*  Fucks her name. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2784.52s)]
*  Why does that not bother me nearly as much [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2786.52s)]
*  as male pedophiles? [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2788.52s)]
*  Because it's fucking cool. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2790.52s)]
*  He found out about something cool later. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2792.52s)]
*  He found out about something cool a little sooner than he should have. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2794.92s)]
*  Although I think he got a little damaged. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2796.92s)]
*  Of course he got damaged. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2798.92s)]
*  I'm just kidding. I have a friend of mine that got really fucked up by that. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2800.92s)]
*  Mary Kay. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2802.92s)]
*  Oh, this is similar too. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2804.92s)]
*  Oh, that was the one I got. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2806.92s)]
*  Was the Mary Kay one. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2808.92s)]
*  Mary Kay Luterno. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2810.92s)]
*  Oh yeah. That was a famous one. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2812.92s)]
*  He was 13. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2814.92s)]
*  She started to have sex with him when he was 13. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2816.92s)]
*  Damn, she was already the mother of four [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2818.92s)]
*  and had a marriage that was disintegrating. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2820.92s)]
*  The first sex you get, you don't even get dev sex with a fellow teenager. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2823.32s)]
*  You gotta bang this old lady who's had 50 kids. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2825.32s)]
*  You don't even know. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2827.32s)]
*  I mean. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2829.32s)]
*  I think they got married [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2831.32s)]
*  after [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2833.32s)]
*  they split up [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2835.32s)]
*  and she went to jail and then they still got married. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2837.32s)]
*  She passed away in 2020. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2839.32s)]
*  Of what? [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2841.32s)]
*  Died at 58. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2843.32s)]
*  I think she had butt cancer. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2845.32s)]
*  I swear to God. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2847.32s)]
*  He was just shooting loads in there forever. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2849.32s)]

*  Could be bad for you. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2871.7200000000003s)]
*  Probably not good. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2873.7200000000003s)]
*  Otherwise everybody would do it. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2875.7200000000003s)]
*  Imagine if that was the key to longevity. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2877.7200000000003s)]
*  We have found [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2880.12s)]
*  this is the reason why ancient cultures [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2882.12s)]
*  If I had to do it. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2884.12s)]

*  If you had to fuck a guy. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2888.12s)]
*  I was telling Tony the other day [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2890.12s)]
*  I'd fuck a guy who still wears a mask. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2892.12s)]
*  Like shut up. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2894.12s)]
*  If the guy is still wearing a mask in 2023 I'll pick him. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2896.12s)]
*  I saw a guy on the plane yesterday wearing a mask. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2898.12s)]
*  Guy rock hard when I saw him. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2900.12s)]

*  I feel bad for them. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2910.52s)]
*  They're not getting good information. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2912.52s)]
*  They're lost. They're scared. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2914.52s)]
*  I get it. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2916.52s)]
*  That fucked me up. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2918.52s)]
*  For like a year I was afraid of talking close to people. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2920.52s)]
*  I was afraid for quite a few months. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2922.52s)]
*  For however long that was. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2924.52s)]
*  That fucked me up for a while. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2926.52s)]
*  I feel like until I got to Texas I was afraid. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2928.52s)]
*  But LA was afraid. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2930.52s)]
*  It was in the air. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2932.52s)]
*  People were freaked the fuck out. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2934.52s)]
*  They were weirded out. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2936.92s)]
*  Bill Burnett's podcast was yelling at someone [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2938.92s)]
*  who was across the street who didn't have a mask on. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2940.92s)]
*  He talked about it on the podcast. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2942.92s)]
*  What? No mask? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2944.92s)]
*  Bill was all in on that nonsense. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2946.92s)]
*  He was. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2948.92s)]
*  But I swear to God it's in the air there. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2950.92s)]
*  I feel like if he was here he wouldn't have done that. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2952.92s)]
*  There's a thing that's real. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2954.92s)]
*  And you can feel it when you go to other countries for sure. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2956.92s)]
*  And you can feel it when you go to other countries for sure. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2958.92s)]
*  Is that people have [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2960.92s)]
*  There's a different vibe [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2962.92s)]
*  that the people there have. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2965.32s)]
*  And if you're [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2967.32s)]
*  Vibes and people's thoughts [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2969.32s)]
*  and their energy [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2971.32s)]
*  is very contagious. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2973.32s)]
*  And if you're around people [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2975.32s)]
*  that are freaked out [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2977.32s)]
*  you're going to be more freaked out than you would be [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2979.32s)]
*  if you're around people who weren't. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2981.32s)]
*  And most people [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2983.32s)]
*  have a certain level of anxiety anyway. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2985.32s)]
*  There's a reason why they're selling so much Xanax. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2987.32s)]
*  There's a reason why so many people aren't SSRIs. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2989.32s)]
*  There's a lot of people out there [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2991.32s)]
*  that are not on a good path [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2993.7200000000003s)]
*  whether it's because of their own fault [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2995.7200000000003s)]
*  or whether it's decisions that were made [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2997.7200000000003s)]
*  that affected them [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=2999.7200000000003s)]
*  or the way they were raised [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3001.7200000000003s)]
*  or the fucking environment they find themselves in. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3003.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm not casting any blame on people. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3005.7200000000003s)]
*  But there's a certain percentage of the population [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3007.7200000000003s)]
*  that is just already fucked up. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3009.7200000000003s)]
*  And then Covid came along. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3011.7200000000003s)]
*  And it just ran [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3013.7200000000003s)]
*  and I think there was more people [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3015.7200000000003s)]
*  that are already fucked up [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3017.7200000000003s)]
*  in these high population [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3019.7200000000003s)]
*  urban areas. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3022.12s)]
*  And I think it's just natural. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3024.12s)]
*  Because I don't think people are supposed to be [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3026.12s)]
*  stacked on top of each other like that. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3028.12s)]
*  One of the things that I felt when I went to Scotland [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3030.12s)]
*  you feel relaxed [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3032.12s)]
*  almost immediately. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3034.12s)]
*  And we were all talking about this. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3036.12s)]
*  We were like [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3038.12s)]
*  I think when you're around [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3040.12s)]
*  a shit ton of people [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3042.12s)]
*  whether you recognize it or not [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3044.12s)]
*  there's something you're experiencing. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3046.12s)]
*  There's energy you're experiencing [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3048.12s)]
*  just because there's so many numbers [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3050.52s)]
*  and you're paying attention to all these different people [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3052.52s)]
*  and seeing, looking around you [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3054.52s)]
*  and taking in all this data [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3056.52s)]
*  whether it's a lot of noise [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3058.52s)]
*  or whether there's physical energy [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3060.52s)]
*  that comes off of people that we just don't know [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3062.52s)]
*  how to measure yet. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3064.52s)]
*  I'm more inclined to think that. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3066.52s)]
*  Because this is why I like the mountains so much. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3068.52s)]
*  When I go to the mountains, dude [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3070.52s)]
*  I feel better. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3072.52s)]
*  You feel like [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3074.52s)]
*  whatever the f*** [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3076.52s)]
*  is f***ing with people in cities. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3078.92s)]
*  So if you go to cities and everybody's all [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3080.92s)]
*  ramped up and crazy. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3082.92s)]
*  Why are they so ramped up like that but they're not [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3084.92s)]
*  in Scotland? [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3086.92s)]
*  Because you're not supposed to be stacked on top of each other like that. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3088.92s)]
*  This is some new thing we're trying out. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3090.92s)]
*  I get in a bad mood. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3092.92s)]
*  You gotta walk behind someone slow. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3094.92s)]
*  I'm just furious all day. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3096.92s)]
*  And people in New York [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3098.92s)]
*  they behave as if you're not gonna punch them. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3100.92s)]
*  They knock into you [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3102.92s)]
*  and talk shit. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3104.92s)]
*  They do shit to people for no reason on the street. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3107.32s)]
*  This is wild. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3109.32s)]
*  And they get punched. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3111.32s)]
*  In New York they continuously get punched [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3113.32s)]
*  and keep going. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3115.32s)]
*  Some guy hit my car with a briefcase once. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3117.32s)]
*  And I came [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3119.32s)]
*  that close to stopping the car. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3121.32s)]
*  I was coming home from some stupid f***ing audition [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3123.32s)]
*  that I didn't want to do. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3125.32s)]
*  And there's dork. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3127.32s)]
*  There's dork in his glasses. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3129.32s)]
*  And I was in the intersection [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3131.32s)]
*  and my light was green and they were all jaywalking. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3133.32s)]
*  And he just decided to hit my f***ing car [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3135.7200000000003s)]
*  with his briefcase. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3139.7200000000003s)]
*  If it wasn't a piece of shit car [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3141.7200000000003s)]
*  I might have brained him. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3143.7200000000003s)]
*  I was thinking about braining him. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3145.7200000000003s)]
*  I was thinking about spinning back heel. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3147.7200000000003s)]
*  I was just gonna hit the f***ing e-brake [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3149.7200000000003s)]
*  and just run out and brain him. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3151.7200000000003s)]
*  Just shut him off. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3153.7200000000003s)]
*  And no one would do anything. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3155.7200000000003s)]
*  Back then I could have got away with it too. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3157.7200000000003s)]
*  Because this is the 90's. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3159.7200000000003s)]
*  It wasn't like there was cameras anywhere. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3161.7200000000003s)]
*  His head probably would have bounced off the concrete. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3164.12s)]
*  And that would have been a wrap. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3166.12s)]
*  That's how people die dude. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3168.12s)]
*  Like if you're gonna brain someone in the street [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3170.12s)]
*  you really should kick him in the body. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3172.12s)]
*  You hit him with a body kick. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3174.12s)]
*  Yeah you really should body kick him. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3176.12s)]
*  Because you don't want to kill him. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3178.12s)]
*  You don't want him to hurt. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3180.12s)]
*  If you kick someone in the head in the street [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3182.12s)]
*  you're very very likely you could kill them. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3184.12s)]
*  There's like a 2 out of 10 [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3186.12s)]
*  possibility that you're gonna kill them. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3188.12s)]
*  That would get you some respect in prison though. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3190.12s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3192.52s)]
*  He hit my f***ing car with a briefcase. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3194.52s)]
*  I round housed him and he died. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3196.52s)]
*  The earth killed him. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3198.52s)]
*  I didn't kill him. I just knocked him out. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3200.52s)]
*  You know cum's good for your butt? [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3202.52s)]
*  I heard it's bad for your butt. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3204.52s)]
*  That's what I heard. I heard it's bad. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3206.52s)]
*  I just don't like the level of tension [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3208.52s)]
*  that's involved when there's so many people around. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3210.52s)]
*  I mean it's still here. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3212.52s)]
*  It's in Austin. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3214.52s)]
*  There's like this attitude. This urban attitude. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3216.52s)]
*  Yeah it's not that bad here though. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3218.52s)]
*  Dude there's just not enough people here. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3220.92s)]
*  The level, the feeling [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3222.92s)]
*  when I first moved here. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3224.92s)]
*  I was like oh this is the right number of people. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3226.92s)]
*  It's like the number of people where you can [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3228.92s)]
*  sustain great restaurants. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3230.92s)]
*  You can sustain a great university. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3232.92s)]
*  You can sustain a bunch of good businesses. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3234.92s)]
*  It's plenty big. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3236.92s)]
*  Yeah it's definitely better than New York [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3238.92s)]
*  as far as... [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3240.92s)]

*  I stayed at the plaza near the Central Park. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3244.92s)]
*  I was just walking around. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3249.32s)]
*  It was very nice. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3251.32s)]

*  That shows how many hunters are out there. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3613.7200000000003s)]
*  They're like that guy. They're ethical. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3615.7200000000003s)]
*  Also, that's a little deer. You don't really want to shoot that. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3617.7200000000003s)]
*  That's a little pumper. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3619.72s)]
*  That's like a one year old deer. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3621.72s)]
*  See how he has very tiny antlers? [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3623.72s)]
*  Maybe two. He might be two years old. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3625.72s)]
*  But that's about it. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3627.72s)]
*  He's not old. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3629.72s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3631.72s)]
*  But if you were in a place that has low deer population density [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3633.72s)]
*  or low buck density. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3635.72s)]
*  Some places like, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3637.72s)]
*  they'll just shoot any buck. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3639.72s)]
*  Because you can shoot any buck. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3641.72s)]
*  Some places have different rules. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3643.72s)]
*  They have to have forked tines. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3645.72s)]
*  They can't be like stubs. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3647.72s)]
*  They can't be what's called a button buck. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3649.72s)]
*  What a button buck is. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3651.72s)]
*  They're so young, they barely have antlers. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3653.72s)]
*  They have this little nub. But they're still a male. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3655.72s)]
*  So you're technically allowed to shoot. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3657.72s)]
*  You're a big old fuck. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3659.72s)]
*  You saw me in that ice plunge. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3661.72s)]
*  That ice plunge doesn't count. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3663.72s)]
*  That's not fair. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3665.72s)]
*  Your dick's gone. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3667.72s)]
*  Yeah, 37 degrees for three minutes, your dick's gone. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3669.72s)]
*  And with that water flowing too. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3671.72s)]
*  That one's rougher. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3673.72s)]
*  The blue cube, the one we have in the studio, [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3675.72s)]
*  that's the roughest one. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3677.72s)]
*  I will say this about cold plunges. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3679.72s)]
*  The only thing you do after you do a cold plunge is tell people you took a cold plunge. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3681.72s)]
*  I can't shut the fuck up about it. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3683.72s)]
*  It's like people get into yoga. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3685.72s)]
*  They can't shut the fuck up. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3687.72s)]
*  I understand. I've always judged those people. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3689.72s)]
*  Me too. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3691.72s)]
*  I've been to those people. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3693.72s)]
*  I am those people. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3695.72s)]
*  I'm those people with almost everything I like. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3697.72s)]
*  I get it. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3699.72s)]
*  Not really. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3701.72s)]
*  I thought you were wrong about the cold plunge. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3703.72s)]
*  Me, Ari, and Mark stuck our hands in the cold plunge. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3705.72s)]
*  See if we could do 30 seconds. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3707.72s)]
*  It was like, no. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3709.72s)]
*  Fuck this. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3711.72s)]
*  You did three minutes today. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3713.72s)]
*  You're a stud now. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3715.72s)]
*  I just needed you standing there going, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3717.72s)]
*  get in there, bitch. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3719.72s)]
*  Get in there, pussy. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3721.72s)]
*  I'm not a pussy, Joe. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3723.72s)]
*  Come on, man. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3725.72s)]
*  You got in pretty easy. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3727.72s)]
*  The first time you did it was rough, but now you're pretty accustomed to it. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3729.72s)]
*  The first time you get in, it sucks the fucking wind out of your gut. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3731.72s)]
*  You've done it at least eight, nine times now. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3733.72s)]
*  How many times have you done it? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3735.72s)]
*  Every time. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3737.72s)]
*  I enjoy it. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3739.72s)]
*  I enjoy being done with it. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3741.72s)]
*  How good does it feel when you get out of there? [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3743.72s)]
*  You feel like you're on the best drug. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3745.72s)]
*  Like a super manageable drug. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3747.72s)]
*  Genuinely, it feels like Molly. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3749.72s)]
*  If someone ever wants to borrow money, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3751.72s)]
*  they need to catch me right when I'm coming out of the sauna or the cold plunge. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3753.72s)]
*  I've also noticed when I get out of it, I can't shut the fuck up. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3755.72s)]
*  I get out of it, I can't shut the fuck up. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3757.72s)]
*  I get out, I'm just yapping. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3759.72s)]
*  You're just giddy. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3761.72s)]
*  It's nice. I haven't been happy in a while. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3763.72s)]
*  You can be happy every day. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3765.72s)]
*  Just get one of those fucking things from your backyard. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3767.72s)]
*  We'll hook it up. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3769.72s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3771.72s)]
*  Dude, you should have one. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3773.72s)]
*  You're going to have to come over and call me a pussy. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3775.72s)]
*  I'll come over? [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3777.72s)]
*  Otherwise, I'll never get in there. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3779.72s)]
*  You don't live that far away from me. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3781.72s)]
*  I will drive over your house before shows, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3783.72s)]
*  and we'll both do it together. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3785.72s)]
*  I'll do it. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3787.72s)]
*  It would be great to do right before a show. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3789.72s)]
*  Wake you right up. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3791.72s)]
*  Sometimes when you have Saturday shows, [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3793.72s)]
*  and you're like, fuck, you went out Friday night, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3795.72s)]
*  and you slept in the hotel, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3797.72s)]
*  and you didn't get a good sleep because you're not at home, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3799.72s)]
*  and then you have lunch, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3801.72s)]
*  and it's not very good for you, whatever the fuck you're eating, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3803.72s)]
*  and then you're like, okay, it's six, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3805.72s)]
*  the show's at eight, fuck, I've got to wake up. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3807.72s)]
*  I usually jack off and take a nap. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3809.72s)]
*  That'll work. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3811.72s)]
*  It does something. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3813.72s)]
*  I literally wake up 20 minutes before the car's coming, [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3815.72s)]
*  and I'm like, oh, shit. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3817.72s)]
*  You forget you're doing a show? [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3821.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3823.72s)]
*  If you had a cold plunge in your room, [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3825.72s)]
*  plop in there, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3827.72s)]
*  you're on the path to making yourself a better person, Shane. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3829.72s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3833.72s)]
*  Do you feel this? You're on a spiritual journey. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3835.72s)]
*  No. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3837.72s)]
*  Inside joke. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3839.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3841.72s)]
*  I'm on a spiritual journey right now. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3843.72s)]
*  No, yeah, that'd be cool to be better. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3847.72s)]
*  Yeah, well, these workouts will help. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3849.72s)]
*  All I have to do is just stay consistent. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3851.72s)]
*  Stay consistent. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3853.72s)]
*  Everybody feels better. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3855.72s)]
*  I mean, we were talking about Sahn today, he's like, god, I feel so much better. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3857.72s)]
*  He was saying that he's getting more attractive women hitting him up on dating apps. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3859.72s)]
*  I'm like, I don't think it's... [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3861.72s)]
*  We had to let that cut. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3863.72s)]
*  We were in the sauna, and Sahn was like, [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3865.72s)]
*  I'm definitely getting stronger. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3867.72s)]
*  I'm getting more attractive women on dating sites to respond. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3869.72s)]
*  I think it's because of my five workouts. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3871.72s)]
*  He's awesome, though. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3877.72s)]
*  But he does feel better. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3879.72s)]
*  More confidence. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3881.72s)]
*  How wild is it that he's doing that Muslim prayer? [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3883.72s)]
*  So, for people who don't know, our friend Sahn, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3885.72s)]
*  hilarious comic, [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3887.72s)]
*  works at the mothership, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3889.72s)]
*  he does not understand Arabic, [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3891.72s)]
*  but he can read it and write it. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3893.72s)]
*  Which is like, [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3895.72s)]
*  so crazy. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3897.72s)]
*  He was taught to read it and write it [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3899.72s)]
*  when he was a kid. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3901.72s)]
*  And he can recite Muslim prayers, [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3903.72s)]
*  but he doesn't know what they mean. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3905.72s)]
*  Which is like, what? [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3907.72s)]
*  That was clearly just autism. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3909.72s)]
*  You think so? [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3911.72s)]
*  As soon as he said it, I was like, oh shit, now it makes sense. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3913.72s)]
*  I've heard you say some wacky shit. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3915.72s)]
*  Now I know. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3917.72s)]
*  A touch of the tism. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3919.72s)]
*  He's got a little, yeah. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3921.72s)]
*  A touch of the tism is a superpower. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3923.72s)]
*  It certainly is. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3925.72s)]
*  I'm going to get a little bit more. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3927.72s)]
*  I like to crank it up by like 2%. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3929.72s)]
*  Turn it up a little. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3931.72s)]
*  I have CTE for sure. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3933.72s)]
*  I got a little of that. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3935.72s)]
*  I must. I get hit in the head too many times. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3937.72s)]
*  All the things that I know now [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3939.72s)]
*  about people that get hit in the head, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3941.72s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, it does something. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3943.72s)]
*  Yeah, I got hit in the head for like 10 years. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3945.72s)]
*  And then I also probably have [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3947.72s)]
*  toxoplasmosis, [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3949.72s)]
*  because I used to have a wild cat. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3951.72s)]
*  Most likely I got that too. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3953.72s)]
*  And I always had cats when I was a kid, and they always went out. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3955.72s)]
*  Like cats, if you got [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3957.72s)]
*  cats, you're fucking... [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3959.72s)]
*  You gotta let them out. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3961.72s)]
*  Yeah, but they're a little bunch of little fucking [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3963.72s)]
*  murderers. I'm a big fan of that. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3965.72s)]
*  I'm a big fan of letting them out too, but the thing [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3967.72s)]
*  is like, you're going to get toxo. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3969.72s)]
*  Your cat's going to get toxo, and you're [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3971.72s)]
*  probably going to get it. Yeah, what's it do? [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3973.72s)]
*  It affects your thinking. Makes you more [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3975.72s)]
*  irrational. Makes you more irrational? [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3977.72s)]
*  Yeah, there's a disproportionate number [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3979.72s)]
*  of motorcycle victims. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3981.72s)]
*  They got bit by cats? [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3983.72s)]
*  That test positive for toxoplasmosis. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3985.72s)]
*  They don't know if there's a correlation, but [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3987.72s)]
*  they do think it affects your impulse control. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3989.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3991.72s)]
*  There's also a disproportionate number [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3993.72s)]
*  of successful soccer teams [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3995.72s)]
*  that come from places that have [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3997.72s)]
*  high levels of toxoplasmosis. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=3999.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4001.72s)]
*  They don't know if that's because there's a lot of [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4003.72s)]
*  really successful soccer teams that come from [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4005.72s)]
*  third world countries, [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4007.72s)]
*  poorer countries. That's possible too. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4009.72s)]
*  But it also might be just it makes you wilder. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4011.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4013.72s)]
*  Like literally, possibly [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4015.72s)]
*  could change cultures. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4017.72s)]
*  At one point in time, France, 50% [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4019.72s)]
*  of the country tested positive for it. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4021.72s)]
*  They're just wild people. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4025.72s)]
*  Who's wilder than French? France is wild. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4027.72s)]
*  The French are wild, bro. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4029.72s)]
*  Those are some wild people. I saw Napoleon. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4031.72s)]
*  How was it? I loved it. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4033.72s)]
*  You did? I loved it. Why do people not like it? [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4035.72s)]
*  Here's what I think. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4037.72s)]
*  I think Ridley Scott made Napoleon [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4039.72s)]
*  like a human. Well, Joaquin Phoenix did it. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4041.72s)]
*  Made him like a human being. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4043.72s)]
*  Like he says dumb shit, he fucks up. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4045.72s)]
*  You know? Usually if you're watching [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4047.72s)]
*  like a historical movie, you want him to be [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4049.72s)]
*  like speaking well [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4051.72s)]
*  the entire time. Totally in control. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4053.72s)]
*  Yeah, this is a guy that's like [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4055.72s)]
*  an actual human. He's a human the whole time. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4057.72s)]
*  But every [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4059.72s)]
*  time they cut to a scene where he's fucking his wife, [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4061.72s)]
*  it's so funny. It's just him doggy. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4063.72s)]
*  All he does is doggy style. That was his name? [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4065.72s)]
*  I don't think that's historically accurate. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4067.72s)]
*  They just cut to him [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4069.72s)]
*  and Joseph, he's like, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4071.72s)]
*  it's pretty great. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4073.72s)]
*  That's crazy. So how many [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4079.72s)]
*  sex scenes are in the movie? There's [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4081.72s)]
*  two that I can definitely remember. Wow. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4083.72s)]
*  And both of them are [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4085.72s)]
*  hard cut to him doggy style. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4087.72s)]
*  Interesting. I wonder why. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4089.72s)]
*  I wonder when people figured out you can [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4091.72s)]
*  have sex looking at each other. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4093.72s)]
*  Because most animals are doggy style. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4095.72s)]
*  Yeah. Like all of them, in fact. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4097.719999999999s)]
*  I mean, I would imagine. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4099.719999999999s)]
*  I don't want to turn this into some type of freak shit [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4101.719999999999s)]
*  but I saw a funny video of a gorilla [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4103.719999999999s)]
*  doggy style on another gorilla. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4105.719999999999s)]
*  It's just kids watching at the zoo. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4107.719999999999s)]
*  He's like [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4109.719999999999s)]
*  funny how human they look when they [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4111.719999999999s)]
*  fuck. It's so funny. They have little tiny [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4113.719999999999s)]
*  dicks, you know. They have little tiny dicks. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4115.719999999999s)]
*  Gorillas? Yeah. Fuck yeah. Chimps have big [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4117.719999999999s)]
*  dicks. Do you know why? Why? [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4119.719999999999s)]
*  Because chimp females are more promiscuous. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4121.719999999999s)]
*  There's a [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4123.72s)]
*  Gorillas also have little balls. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4125.72s)]
*  This is interesting. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4127.72s)]
*  Like in primates, there's [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4129.72s)]
*  a direct relationship between the [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4131.72s)]
*  number of promiscuous females [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4133.72s)]
*  that are nearby and the size of the male's [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4135.72s)]
*  testicles. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4137.72s)]
*  Oh wow. That's crazy. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4139.72s)]
*  That's wild. It's an interesting fact. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4141.72s)]
*  Yeah. That's why chimp have giant [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4143.72s)]
*  nuts. Because chimp [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4145.72s)]
*  ladies are wild. They want big nuts? [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4147.72s)]
*  Yeah, they want big nuts. But they need a lot of [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4149.72s)]
*  loads. They're going to war. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4151.72s)]
*  Yeah. Trying to make babies. Those guys are [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4153.72s)]
*  having a tough time. They're having a tough time. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4155.72s)]
*  Yeah. That chimp empire shit [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4157.72s)]
*  bugged me out. I didn't like it. It's wild. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4159.72s)]
*  I liked the dude in the beginning of chimp [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4161.72s)]
*  empire, the guy, there's the first scene [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4163.72s)]
*  where they go fight the other colony. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4165.72s)]
*  And he's like, I'm out of here. This [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4167.72s)]
*  is too much. And then they catch him at the other [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4169.72s)]
*  colony, caught him on the way back and killed him. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4171.72s)]
*  I respected him just being [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4173.72s)]
*  like, I know you guys are going to make fun of me [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4175.72s)]
*  when we get back. This is [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4177.72s)]
*  scary. I'm going home. You can't even join [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4179.72s)]
*  the other team. They got ripped apart. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4181.72s)]
*  At least some armies, even [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4183.72s)]
*  the Mongols, they used to take in other [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4185.72s)]
*  warriors and go, hey, join us. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4187.72s)]
*  We're going to have to kill you. I wonder if [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4189.72s)]
*  chimps ever do that. Well [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4191.72s)]
*  something has to happen, right? Because they do [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4193.72s)]
*  branch off. They were saying that there [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4195.72s)]
*  was one clan that was a part of [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4197.72s)]
*  another group. I bet they'd just start fucking [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4199.72s)]
*  the ladies. What do they call [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4201.72s)]
*  a tribe? Is it a tribe? What do they [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4203.72s)]
*  call them? Troop? A troop [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4205.72s)]
*  of chimps? I could be wrong on that one. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4207.72s)]
*  Jamie, what are you doing over there? [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4209.72s)]
*  I'm talking about gorillas fucking. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4211.72s)]
*  I'm following all along here. I was looking for doggy style scenes in Napoleon actually. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4215.72s)]
*  I was trying to find the action scene. I thought I had something but I lost it. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4219.72s)]
*  Now we're on the new stuff. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4225.72s)]
*  Can you please find gorillas fucking at the zoo? [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4227.72s)]
*  What was the other thing? [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4231.72s)]
*  And then? Wait, right after gorillas? [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4233.72s)]
*  Troops? What is the group? What do they call them? A tribe? [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4235.72s)]
*  A clan? [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4239.72s)]
*  A group of apes or chimpanzees is a shrewdness. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4241.72s)]
*  Whoa. Yeah, those are fun. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4245.72s)]
*  A shrewdness? [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4247.72s)]
*  That can't be right. It's British bullshit. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4249.72s)]
*  Is that like the British where they spell tire with a Y? [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4251.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's bullshit, dude. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4255.72s)]
*  Tyres? Tyres with a Y? [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4257.72s)]
*  Antelopes are herds, ants are colony, apes are shrewdness. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4259.72s)]
*  A shrewdness? Baboons are a troop. Oh, okay. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4263.72s)]
*  Ants are a colony or an army. Interesting. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4267.72s)]
*  That guy Sapolsky, Robert Sapolsky who did all the research on talkteloplasmosis, [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4270.72s)]
*  he was the one I found out about the disproportionate number of motorcycle victims. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4275.72s)]
*  He also did some crazy work with baboons. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4279.72s)]
*  And one of the things they found, these baboons, they had these like really rough alpha males, [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4283.72s)]
*  like evil, mean, brutal, bully alpha males. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4288.72s)]
*  And they were getting food from this resort. They were getting food from the garbage. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4292.72s)]
*  So like hundreds of them would go to the garbage in the resort and tear it apart. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4297.72s)]
*  And this one, here we go. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4301.72s)]
*  Hey. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4303.72s)]
*  That's so funny. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4305.72s)]
*  Ass on him. Good lord. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4306.72s)]
*  Imagine what kind of deadlifts he could do. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4308.72s)]
*  It's so funny. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4310.72s)]
*  Yeah. But look how short his strokes are. See what I'm saying? [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4311.72s)]
*  Yeah, been there, brother. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4314.72s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4316.72s)]
*  That's exactly how I fuck. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4317.72s)]
*  That's how you fuck. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4319.72s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4320.72s)]
*  He's slow. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4321.72s)]
*  Get the fuck out of there. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4322.72s)]
*  The child is coming to look. He's going to get under there. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4324.72s)]
*  The child is going to tickle his balls. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4326.72s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4328.72s)]
*  No rules at all. The child is going to get... [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4330.72s)]
*  That's a baby chimp, man. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4332.72s)]
*  That's a baby chimp just going, what are you doing to my mom? [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4334.72s)]
*  Yes, dude, help. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4337.72s)]
*  Push, push. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4340.72s)]
*  I may help you push. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4342.72s)]
*  I mean that's... [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4343.72s)]
*  So these baboons... [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4344.72s)]
*  That's not the one I was talking about. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4346.72s)]
*  The mean ones got to the garbage first. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4348.72s)]
*  It turned out the garbage was poisoned. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4351.72s)]
*  The garbage had something in it that was poisoned. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4353.72s)]
*  So these chimps died off. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4357.72s)]
*  So the alphas died and then everybody chilled out. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4359.72s)]
*  And so this troop, I guess, of baboons, for like I think a decade, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4362.72s)]
*  were peaceful and cool. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4368.72s)]
*  And then it eventually devolved back to bully alphas [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4371.72s)]
*  that were beating up all the other chimps. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4376.72s)]
*  Hey, we're no different. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4378.72s)]
*  World War II, now we've been chilling for a while. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4380.72s)]
*  And all of a sudden there's some... [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4382.72s)]
*  Well, how long do we chill for? Up to Vietnam. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4384.72s)]
*  That barely counts. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4386.72s)]
*  Compared to World War II. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4389.72s)]
*  Right. But completely unnecessary. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4393.72s)]
*  Whereas World War II was necessary. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4397.72s)]
*  Because of an unnecessary start. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4400.72s)]
*  What was the unnecessary start of World War II? [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4403.72s)]
*  Hitler taking everything? [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4405.72s)]
*  Yeah, but a lot of it is based on what happened in World War I. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4407.72s)]
*  So World War I... [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4412.72s)]
*  One and two are pretty... [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4414.72s)]
*  Everything in history is interlinked. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4416.72s)]
*  And there's not that much time between them either. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4418.72s)]
*  So there's like a regrouping of Germany. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4420.72s)]
*  We'll fucking show you. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4422.72s)]
*  What was World War I over? [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4424.72s)]
*  That's the ultimate dumbest fucking one ever. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4428.72s)]
*  What is it over? [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4431.72s)]
*  Archduke Franz Ferdinand got assassinated in Serbia. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4433.72s)]
*  That's right. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4437.72s)]
*  And the guy Lucky ran into him outside of a restaurant. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4439.72s)]
*  I tried to kill him, didn't. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4442.72s)]
*  Then his car was parked outside of a restaurant. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4444.72s)]
*  He's like, oh! [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4446.72s)]
*  Yeah, there he is. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4448.72s)]
*  And then their ally, Serbia's ally, was Russia. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4450.72s)]
*  Austria's ally was Germany. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4452.72s)]
*  Germany was like, we're going to help Austria. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4454.72s)]
*  That's why they got blamed. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4457.72s)]
*  That's why they got blamed. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4460.72s)]
*  Wow. And then the whole world... [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4462.72s)]
*  And then the whole world, which they were all cousins. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4464.72s)]
*  Why were they... Why did they assassinate that dude? [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4467.72s)]
*  Because Austria and Serbia, I guess, had a pretty long history of fighting each other. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4469.72s)]
*  And he was in Serbia... [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4476.72s)]
*  Montenegro, was it? [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4479.72s)]
*  And he... It was kind of like flaunting it a little. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4481.72s)]
*  Oh! [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4483.72s)]
*  It was kind of like, you shouldn't be here. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4485.72s)]
*  Like when Nancy Pelosi went to tie him, Juan? [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4487.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4489.72s)]
*  I was just like, yeah, I can handle it. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4491.72s)]
*  What? What are you going to do, child? [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4493.72s)]
*  I could be wrong, though. I think it was like... [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4495.72s)]
*  Franz Ferdinand was actually one of the guys in Austria that liked Serbia. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4497.72s)]
*  And he was one of the guys helping it. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4501.72s)]
*  He was like an advocate for it. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4503.72s)]
*  And then the black hand... [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4505.72s)]
*  And I'm forgetting his fucking name. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4507.72s)]
*  He's very important. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4509.72s)]
*  The guy who shot him. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4511.72s)]
*  I don't remember his name either. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4513.72s)]
*  It's embarrassing. I don't remember it. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4515.72s)]
*  And I hope it's Serbia. I'm just talking. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4517.72s)]
*  I think it is. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4519.72s)]
*  He was from the Kingdom of Serbia. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4521.72s)]
*  The thing I was looking at didn't have his name. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4523.72s)]
*  This doesn't either. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4527.72s)]
*  So, what happens in Germany during World War I? [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4529.72s)]
*  So, World War I was over nothing. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4531.72s)]
*  They fought... Everybody died. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4533.72s)]
*  Like millions of people died. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4535.72s)]
*  And a lot of times it's just trench warfare where they... [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4537.72s)]
*  Over the course of four or five years, they gained nothing, lost nothing. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4539.72s)]
*  So at the end of the war, [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4543.72s)]
*  when France and Germany and England had to sign this treaty, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4545.72s)]
*  they were like... [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4549.72s)]
*  The allies that won were like, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4551.72s)]
*  we gotta gain something out of this, [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4553.72s)]
*  because otherwise our people are gonna kill us. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4557.72s)]
*  When we signed this treaty and neither of us... [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=4559.72s)]

*  or the black paintings, I forget. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5055.72s)]
*  But apparently Goya lost his mind [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5057.72s)]
*  and all these paintings were from in his own house [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5059.72s)]
*  on the walls. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5061.72s)]
*  That wasn't on a canvas. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5063.72s)]
*  That was on his wall. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5065.72s)]
*  That he did by himself. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5067.72s)]
*  He lost his mind. He would paint at night with candles on his head. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5069.72s)]
*  Like a chandelier of candles on his head. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5071.72s)]

*  studies on that, like trauma passes through DNA. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5175.72s)]
*  Generational trauma. Yeah. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5177.72s)]
*  McCusker was just talking to me about it. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5179.72s)]

*  some things that kids are scared of, right? [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5183.72s)]

*  It's probably difficult [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5201.72s)]

*  transferred into the kid. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5213.72s)]
*  Which is wild, because if you have a kid and you [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5215.72s)]

*  And then, yeah, he lost his [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5235.72s)]
*  mind. He just all started getting [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5237.72s)]
*  the satanic shit. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5239.72s)]

*  was the only one that directly threatened the Roman [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5353.72s)]
*  heartland of Italy. It was particularly [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5355.72s)]
*  alarming to Rome because its military seemed [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5357.72s)]

*  sword, to witness a sword fight would be [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5467.72s)]
*  so horrific. Imagine though [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5469.72s)]
*  if like the winner got a hundred [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5471.72s)]
*  million dollars. Do you know how many [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5473.72s)]
*  trailer park dudes would step in [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5475.72s)]
*  to sword fight for a hundred [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5477.72s)]
*  million dollars? [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5479.72s)]
*  I think after witnessing the first [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5481.72s)]
*  bout, everyone would go, oh [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5483.72s)]
*  no. I think not. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5485.72s)]
*  I bet them bull riders [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5487.72s)]
*  would get involved. Then you'd have a real [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5489.72s)]
*  problem. I think getting killed is true. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5491.72s)]
*  Yeah, oh yeah. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5493.72s)]
*  They're doing this shit. Roger's already after it. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5495.72s)]
*  But this is different. They're wearing armor. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5497.72s)]
*  But they do beat the fuck [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5499.72s)]
*  out of each other. Yeah. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5501.72s)]
*  It's pretty wild. But I don't think anybody's [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5503.72s)]
*  dying. And they actually [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5505.72s)]
*  wind up doing MMA with each other. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5507.72s)]
*  Which [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5509.72s)]
*  I would kind of think if you're really good at [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5511.72s)]
*  MMA, I would kind of like fake [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5513.72s)]
*  the sword. Yeah, just take the [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5515.72s)]
*  shoot the legs. I would [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5517.72s)]
*  use that fucking [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5519.72s)]
*  bitch ass shield that they have [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5521.72s)]
*  and I would rush them. I'd rush them [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5523.72s)]
*  and just trip this guy, pull his helmet off and beat him [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5525.72s)]
*  to death. So in a sword fight that you're saying [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5527.72s)]
*  to say, is there no MMA allowed? [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5529.72s)]
*  It seems like they're clenching though. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5531.72s)]
*  They kick each other. See look, he kicked him. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5533.72s)]
*  He kicked his inside leg. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5535.72s)]
*  Yeah, and he's got shin pads on [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5537.72s)]
*  too. Oh man. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5539.72s)]
*  He got popped in the head. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5541.72s)]
*  Yeah, he got popped in the head with a sword. Look at his, he's needle in the nuts. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5543.72s)]
*  You can get away [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5545.72s)]
*  with some stuff in this. There's mountains in the back. This is [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5547.72s)]
*  awesome. It's pretty wild [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5549.72s)]
*  that they have these kind of fights. These guys are getting tired [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5551.72s)]
*  too. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5553.72s)]
*  The armor on. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5555.72s)]
*  The shields [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5557.72s)]
*  again when they come together. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5559.72s)]
*  See, they go to the ground. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5561.72s)]
*  They go to the ground. If you go to the ground like that, [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5563.72s)]
*  let go your fucking sword and take his back. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5565.72s)]
*  See, this guy's on top. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5567.72s)]
*  This guy knows what he's doing. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5569.72s)]
*  He's dropping some fucking shield [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5571.72s)]
*  strikes to him. He let go of his sword. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5573.72s)]
*  That guy gave up. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5575.72s)]
*  Yeah, see, good move by that guy. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5577.72s)]
*  Let go of the sword. It's not effective. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5579.72s)]
*  The guy's covered in armor. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5581.72s)]
*  How long before they're not? How long before there's two dudes in their underwear [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5583.72s)]
*  with a samurai sword? [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5585.72s)]
*  Just one sword, they have to fight over it? [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5589.72s)]
*  Wow. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5591.72s)]
*  Like an Oklahoma drill? [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5593.72s)]
*  That would be wild. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5595.72s)]
*  They would just get sprinters. Sprinters would be [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5597.72s)]
*  the first person to get the sword. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5599.72s)]
*  I'm not... [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5601.72s)]
*  Look, it happened before. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5603.72s)]
*  It's happened in history before. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5605.72s)]
*  For sure. People [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5607.72s)]
*  fought sword fights. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5609.72s)]
*  Do you think there's someone out there that's thinking about fighting a sword fight [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5611.72s)]
*  right now? I think there's tons of dudes [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5613.72s)]
*  right now with a rock and a sword. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5615.72s)]
*  Statistically, there's a guy [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5617.72s)]
*  listening to this right now with a thousand [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5619.72s)]
*  guys holding a sword right now. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5621.72s)]
*  One thousand. Out of all our listeners, [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5623.72s)]
*  one thousand have a sword. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5625.72s)]
*  How different from fencing is it then? [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5627.72s)]
*  Right. That's what I'm saying. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5629.72s)]
*  Fencing is just the gentleman's way of poking [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5631.72s)]
*  each other with a sword. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5633.72s)]
*  But it's still a fucking sword fight, man. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5635.72s)]
*  Yeah, but these are just dorks. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5637.72s)]
*  Fencing might be [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5639.72s)]
*  the fucking lamest shit ever. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5641.72s)]
*  It's hard to do. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5643.72s)]
*  It involves a lot of technique. You can get [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5645.72s)]
*  fucked up. No shit. I'm not saying they're [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5647.72s)]
*  lame because I'm better. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5649.72s)]
*  I could never do that. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5651.72s)]
*  It's just lame to do it. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5653.72s)]
*  Yeah. Well, especially now [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5655.72s)]
*  with all the bullets and everything. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5657.72s)]
*  Bullets are better than swords. It's way better. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5659.72s)]
*  It's way better. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5661.72s)]
*  That's what held back the Japanese. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5663.72s)]
*  You know, the samurais were like very reluctant [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5665.72s)]
*  to get involved with guns. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5667.72s)]
*  They're like, come on. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5669.72s)]
*  This bitch ass shit. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5671.72s)]
*  We got arrows already. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5673.72s)]
*  Fight like a man. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5675.72s)]
*  And that didn't work out so well. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5677.72s)]
*  No. They ran into, yeah. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5679.72s)]
*  But they were the first people [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5681.72s)]
*  to hold off the Mongols. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5683.72s)]
*  The samurai were the first people to hold off [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5685.72s)]
*  the Mongols. Did they get hit with a [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5687.72s)]
*  wave? They got hit with a little bit of a wave. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5689.72s)]
*  Yeah, they were unsuccessful though. Samurais fought [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5691.72s)]
*  them off. I mean, that is [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5693.72s)]
*  a wild culture. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5695.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5697.72s)]
*  A warlike island [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5699.72s)]
*  in the Pacific [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5701.72s)]
*  with some of the greatest [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5703.72s)]
*  martial arts inventions of all [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5705.72s)]
*  time coming from this one place. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5707.72s)]
*  Judo, karate. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5709.72s)]
*  So much came from that place. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5711.72s)]
*  Different styles of karate. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5713.72s)]
*  Yeah, they got rowdy. Kendo. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5717.72s)]
*  Japan got rowdy. Yeah, they got [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5719.72s)]
*  rowdy. Yeah, [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5721.72s)]
*  they did have the drip severe. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5723.72s)]
*  Look at that drip. We got one of those. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5725.72s)]
*  You seen that one that we have? Yes. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5727.72s)]
*  We have a real one. That's a real one from the 1890s. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5729.72s)]
*  Samurai might have the best drip. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5731.72s)]
*  They had good drip. They look dope. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5733.72s)]
*  When I was a kid. I gotta piss. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5737.72s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. Tremendously. Let's pause right here on samurai. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5739.72s)]
*  Oh, there was an African samurai in Japan. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5741.72s)]
*  One dude. I bet he ran. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5743.72s)]
*  I see when they wrote that article. Within the last three years. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5745.72s)]
*  Yeah. Back on [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5747.72s)]
*  Samurai. Black samurai. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5749.72s)]
*  Black samurai. Yasuke [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5751.72s)]

*  in the household of Oda [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5761.72s)]
*  Nobunaga. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5763.72s)]
*  He was employed by the Japanese [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5765.72s)]
*  Sengoku. Oh, I can't even say all that [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5767.72s)]
*  shit. Try that one. Dayamo [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5769.72s)]
*  Oda Nobunaga. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5771.72s)]
*  And served as [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5773.72s)]
*  a koshou, page, or [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5775.72s)]
*  sword bearer. He was neither a menial [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5777.72s)]
*  nor an indentured servant, but [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5779.72s)]
*  a retainer who was given a stipend [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5781.72s)]
*  by Nobunaga. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5783.72s)]
*  Nobunaga. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5785.72s)]
*  Nobunaga. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5787.72s)]
*  So that guy, Nobunaga, [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5789.72s)]
*  was the most powerful man in Japan. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5791.72s)]
*  And [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5793.72s)]
*  Yasuke, I think is his name. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5795.72s)]
*  Came over from a [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5797.72s)]
*  group from Italy, actually. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5799.72s)]
*  And [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5801.72s)]
*  spent some time there. Wanted to go visit that guy. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5803.72s)]
*  And then this is the part I thought was interesting here. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5805.72s)]
*  It's like a description [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5807.72s)]
*  of their meeting. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5809.72s)]
*  Okay. He appears to be [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5811.72s)]
*  26 or 27 years old. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5813.72s)]
*  The blackness of his body [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5815.72s)]
*  is like that of a bull. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5817.72s)]
*  And he is healthy and of fine [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5819.72s)]
*  physique. Moreover, he has [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5821.72s)]
*  the strength of more than ten men. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5823.72s)]
*  The padres came with him and [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5825.72s)]
*  thanked Lord Nobunaga [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5827.72s)]
*  for his permission to proselytize. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5829.72s)]
*  Here's the part two I want. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5831.72s)]
*  Being a black man for the first time, refused to believe [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5833.72s)]
*  that his skin color was natural and not [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5835.72s)]
*  applied later. And made him [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5837.72s)]
*  remove his clothes from the belt upwards. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5839.72s)]
*  Vellignano [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5843.72s)]
*  describes how Nobunaga [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5845.72s)]
*  thinking that he might have ink [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5847.72s)]
*  on his body made him take off his clothes [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5849.72s)]
*  and wash his body. But the more he washed [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5851.72s)]
*  and scrubbed, the darker his skin became. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5853.72s)]
*  Huh. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5857.72s)]
*  And so then he hung out. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5859.72s)]
*  And then he was like, he took him around Japan [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5861.72s)]
*  for like a year. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5863.72s)]
*  Doing feats of strength and stuff. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5865.72s)]
*  That he didn't speak any Japanese. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5867.72s)]
*  He was also given a short sword. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5869.72s)]
*  He was given a short sword in the house. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5871.72s)]
*  He was sometimes made to carry Nobunaga [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5873.72s)]
*  Sama's tools. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5875.72s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5877.72s)]
*  Alright. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5879.72s)]
*  What the fuck were we just talking about [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5881.72s)]
*  before this? [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5883.72s)]
*  There was something else. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5885.72s)]
*  Japan war. Samurais. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5887.72s)]
*  I lost it. God damn it. It was interesting though. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5889.72s)]
*  Napoleon. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5891.72s)]
*  Napoleon rules. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5893.72s)]
*  I give up. I'm not gonna find it. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5895.72s)]
*  It's in my head somewhere. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5899.72s)]
*  Fuck. God damn I hate when that happens. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5901.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5903.72s)]
*  But when you go off on these tangents. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5905.72s)]
*  Oh. The NCA stuff? [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5907.72s)]
*  Oh no. It's not real. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5909.72s)]
*  No. That was the [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5911.72s)]
*  fake news. Yeah. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5913.72s)]
*  But what's real news is the [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5915.72s)]
*  15 and under [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5917.72s)]
*  team [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5919.72s)]

*  in soccer. Yes. Bro. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5923.72s)]
*  That's crazy. I got in such a [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5925.72s)]
*  battle over that. So I was doing [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5927.72s)]
*  a comedy festival [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5929.72s)]
*  when that happened. In Atlanta. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5931.72s)]
*  And I was in the green room. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5933.72s)]
*  And I was already out of place. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5935.72s)]
*  I was sitting next to somebody that was describing [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5937.72s)]
*  the benefits of polyamory. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5939.72s)]
*  And I was like drunken up. This is a comedy club? [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5941.72s)]

*  regardless. So what happened? [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5979.72s)]

*  but I was just starting. Yeah yeah yeah. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5993.72s)]
*  How many years in the comedy were you at this point? [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5995.72s)]
*  5. Okay. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5997.72s)]
*  But we're back there and I [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=5999.72s)]
*  was like this was before [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6001.72s)]
*  I knew you weren't allowed to be like [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6003.72s)]

*  polyamory. I was like that's dumb. You know that's dumb? [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6007.72s)]
*  What you're saying? [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6009.72s)]
*  Fucking crazy what you're [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6011.72s)]
*  saying. And then while we're talking [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6013.72s)]
*  this girl walks in. She's got her phone [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6015.72s)]
*  and she's like oh the men's team lost [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6017.72s)]

*  yeah they've. More people [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6023.72s)]

*  And then that [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6031.72s)]
*  started an argument. She's like how do you know? [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6033.72s)]
*  And I was like the [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6035.72s)]
*  slowest worst guy on the men's team [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6037.72s)]

*  what are you talking. I was like [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6041.72s)]
*  you understand this. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6043.72s)]
*  She was like no you tell me. And then I [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6045.72s)]
*  was like I'm sure they've scrimmaged at some point. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6047.72s)]

*  What'd she call you? [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6059.72s)]
*  Probably like a. Well actually [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6061.72s)]
*  probably just like a dickhead and then probably [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6063.72s)]
*  when I got canceled she was like yeah [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6065.72s)]
*  I knew that guy was a dickhead. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6067.72s)]
*  I'll give her credit. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6069.72s)]
*  I was probably being a dickhead. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6071.72s)]
*  But you probably. She deserved. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6073.72s)]
*  That's nonsense talk. But then. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6075.72s)]
*  Why don't the women get paid more? [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6077.72s)]
*  I heard that argument even about comics. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6079.72s)]
*  Like [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6081.72s)]
*  shut the fuck up. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6083.72s)]
*  Listen if you're Taylor Swift [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6085.72s)]
*  you get paid. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6087.72s)]
*  You get fucking paid. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6089.72s)]
*  There's no guys out there saying [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6091.72s)]
*  why [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6093.72s)]
*  how come I don't get Taylor Swift. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6095.72s)]
*  How come there's not a male Taylor Swift. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6097.72s)]
*  But there's women out there that'll say that [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6099.72s)]
*  about male comics that are killing it. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6101.72s)]
*  Why don't the women get that much? [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6103.72s)]
*  Why don't people of [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6105.72s)]
*  Polynesian descent get a check like that? [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6107.72s)]
*  Why don't people [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6109.72s)]
*  of fucking. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6111.72s)]
*  How come no one from Iceland is getting paid? [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6113.72s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6115.72s)]
*  Yeah that's not how it works. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6117.72s)]
*  Taylor Swift is Taylor Swift. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6119.72s)]
*  Obviously being a woman [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6121.72s)]
*  is not holding her back [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6123.72s)]
*  in the slightest. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6125.72s)]
*  I think those are the two acts. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6127.72s)]
*  Taylor Swift and Beyonce. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6129.72s)]
*  I don't think anyone comes close. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6131.72s)]
*  No one comes close to Taylor Swift. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6133.72s)]
*  I think Beyonce does. She does? [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6135.72s)]
*  I bet she does. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6137.72s)]
*  Let's say both of them. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6139.72s)]
*  Coming out stadiums. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6141.72s)]
*  Fucking arena. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6143.72s)]
*  Arena. They would have to do it like a comedy club. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6145.72s)]
*  They'd have to treat an arena. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6147.72s)]
*  They'd have to treat the T-Mobile center in Vegas [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6149.72s)]
*  like a comedy club. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6151.72s)]
*  Two shows a night. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6153.72s)]
*  Tuesday through Thursday. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6155.72s)]
*  She'd have to do a decade. For real. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6157.72s)]
*  She would have to do a decade. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6159.72s)]
*  It's not possible [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6161.72s)]
*  to have enough tickets for all the people that want to see her. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6163.72s)]
*  Is there a male act that's even close? [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6165.72s)]
*  No. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6169.72s)]
*  Kanye probably before all that shit went down. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6171.72s)]
*  I don't think he was close. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6173.72s)]
*  No. But she wasn't that big back then either. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6175.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6177.72s)]
*  But he made that bitch famous. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6179.72s)]
*  Oh my god he did. He fucked up. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6181.72s)]
*  I made that bitch famous. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6183.72s)]
*  He fucked up. He fucked up. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6185.72s)]
*  He rules. He does rule. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6187.72s)]
*  He says a lot of wild shit. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6189.72s)]
*  He's having fun. I hope so. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6191.72s)]
*  I bet his new album [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6193.72s)]
*  is going to be a fucking [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6195.72s)]
*  banger. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6197.72s)]
*  But you push that dude in a corner [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6199.72s)]
*  I bet he comes out swinging. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6201.72s)]
*  I bet this new shit is a banger. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6203.72s)]
*  Yeah he's the best. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6205.72s)]
*  Isn't he in like [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6207.72s)]
*  Saudi Arabia or something recording it? [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6209.72s)]
*  I know he was definitely in Italy [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6211.72s)]
*  getting his dick sucked on a boat for a little. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6213.72s)]
*  A little bit of that. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6215.72s)]
*  But then he was in Japan or [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6217.72s)]
*  recording at least part of it in the Middle East. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6219.72s)]
*  He might be Sasuke or whatever that guy's name was. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6221.72s)]
*  I think he's in Japan. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6223.72s)]
*  Makes sense. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6225.72s)]
*  It's crazy though. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6227.72s)]
*  Adidas lost billions [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6229.72s)]
*  of dollars to not be in business with them. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6231.72s)]
*  Didn't they take it back? [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6233.72s)]
*  Nope. Nope. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6235.72s)]
*  They just sold their remaining stock. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6237.72s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. I don't think they went back [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6239.72s)]
*  to business together. I think when you lose money [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6241.72s)]
*  like that you go, oop, our bad. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6243.72s)]
*  But that is a rough look for Adidas. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6245.72s)]
*  It's a rough look for everybody. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6247.72s)]
*  But Adidas was literally founded by Nazis. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6249.72s)]
*  Yeah that's what I mean. They gotta be like [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6251.72s)]
*  No we got nothing to do with this. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6253.72s)]
*  We don't have shit to do with this. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6257.72s)]
*  That was then and this is now. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6259.72s)]
*  We are not those people. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6261.72s)]
*  Can you imagine being the fucking CEO of Adidas and seeing that clip [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6263.72s)]
*  with him just like, I love Hitler. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6265.72s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6267.72s)]
*  Fuck dude. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6269.72s)]
*  He was trying to say he loves everybody right? [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6271.72s)]
*  Yeah I think that was the message but boy [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6273.72s)]
*  it got a little murky. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6275.72s)]
*  Well he gets murky. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6277.72s)]
*  He gets murky all the time. Do you remember that time he sat down [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6279.72s)]
*  in the civil office with Trump and he was just [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6281.72s)]
*  rattling off like craziness [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6283.72s)]
*  and Trump's like this. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6285.72s)]
*  Trump is so smart with that stuff. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6287.72s)]
*  He just lets people go. With other people he would shut the fuck up. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6289.72s)]
*  If Chris Christie was in there saying all that nonsense [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6291.72s)]
*  he'd be like, what are you talking about? [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6293.72s)]
*  Get out of here. Yeah. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6295.72s)]
*  But with Kanye he's like, [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6297.72s)]
*  this guy's on my side. Let him go. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6299.72s)]
*  Let him go. I mean we can talk [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6301.72s)]
*  Kanye all day. I love Kanye. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6303.72s)]
*  Kanye had, probably my [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6305.72s)]
*  favorite music video was him and Lil Pump. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6307.72s)]
*  You're such a fucking ho. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6309.72s)]
*  I love it. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6311.72s)]
*  It's a very funny music video. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6313.72s)]
*  They had those crazy fucking suits on. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6315.72s)]
*  Those dumb ass suits. They're just having fun. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6317.72s)]
*  Then they did it live on SNL. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6319.72s)]
*  Let me hear this. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6321.72s)]
*  She's a comic. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6335.72s)]
*  That lady? [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6337.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6339.72s)]
*  That thing he did with that song [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6341.72s)]
*  where he's just making a bunch of noise was pretty funny. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6343.72s)]
*  Skibbidi bop poop. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6345.72s)]
*  Do you know the story behind that? Yeah, with him and Drake. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6347.72s)]
*  It's supposed to be a Drake song. And Drake wanted it. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6349.72s)]
*  And Kanye was like, yeah, guess what? Nope. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6351.72s)]
*  So he made a beat [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6353.72s)]
*  and a great song for Drake and then [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6355.72s)]
*  he released it a couple days later [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6357.72s)]
*  of just him going like, skibbidi bop poop. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6359.72s)]
*  Skibbidi bop poop. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6361.72s)]
*  He just ruined it. He just ruined the whole track. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6363.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6365.72s)]
*  We play this one song [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6367.72s)]
*  in the green room when we really [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6369.72s)]
*  want to get things popping. The I'm Going to [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6371.72s)]

*  when he was doing the podcast, unfortunately [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6423.72s)]
*  Jamie got COVID, so he [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6425.72s)]
*  couldn't be here for it. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6427.72s)]
*  You know what he wanted to do? [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6429.72s)]

*  Keep it going. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6435.72s)]
*  He didn't like my old set, so he wanted [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6437.72s)]
*  to build a set to do the podcast. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6439.72s)]
*  I thought you were talking about stand up. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6441.72s)]
*  No, he wanted to build a set. So I said [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6443.72s)]
*  what do you want to do? Like we're on FaceTime. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6445.72s)]
*  I go, what do you want to do? He goes, [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6447.72s)]

*  would have gone? It was COVID keeping me out of there. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6477.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's just COVID. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6479.72s)]
*  And it was back when COVID was actually [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6481.72s)]
*  COVID. We worried Jamie was going to die. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6483.72s)]
*  Everyone thought I was going to die. I was stuck in a room for a [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6485.72s)]
*  week. Oh, damn. It wasn't allowed to [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6487.72s)]

*  Three months old. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6845.72s)]
*  I mean, I kind of claimed Boston. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6847.72s)]

*  Harrisburg's nice. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6871.72s)]
*  It's rural. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6873.72s)]
*  I'm not talking about the people. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6875.72s)]
*  Three Mile Island's in that area? [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6877.72s)]

*  Yeah, Three Mile Island's where I'm from. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6881.72s)]
*  I thought, why did I think Three Mile Island [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6883.72s)]
*  was in Long Island or something? [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6885.72s)]
*  Makes sense. Long Island. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6887.72s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think I ever knew where it is. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6889.72s)]

*  Crossfire? [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6929.72s)]
*  Yeah, I was reading this book [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6931.72s)]
*  in my fucking hotel room before the show. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6933.72s)]

*  acted alone, first of all, [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6951.72s)]

*  from an evidence perspective [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6955.72s)]
*  when you look at the bullet. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6957.72s)]
*  It doesn't make sense in any way. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6959.72s)]
*  The whole reason why they needed [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6961.72s)]
*  to attribute all these different shots [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6963.72s)]
*  to one bullet, the back [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6965.72s)]
*  and to the left, there's [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6967.72s)]
*  so much wrong with it. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6969.72s)]
*  Everything's wrong with it. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6971.72s)]
*  But that is a crazy [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6973.72s)]
*  story. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6975.72s)]
*  The fact that it was released on television [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6977.72s)]
*  because of a comic. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6979.72s)]
*  Oh, Dick Gregory. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6981.72s)]
*  Dick Gregory, stand up comic. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6983.72s)]
*  He got the Zapruder film. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6985.72s)]
*  It was a Zapruder film. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6987.72s)]
*  And played it on the fucking Geraldo Rivera show. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6989.72s)]
*  And played it 12 [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6991.72s)]
*  years after the assassination. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6993.72s)]
*  That's what's nuts, man. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=6995.72s)]

*  Kind of the bandit. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7023.72s)]
*  Old school [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7025.72s)]
*  dynamite. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7027.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7029.72s)]
*  Right? Yeah, if you do [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7031.72s)]
*  any, that's the one. Everybody talks [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7033.72s)]
*  shit on conspiracy theories. And I get it. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7035.72s)]
*  They shouldn't. Yeah, but [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7037.72s)]
*  there's, I saw the clip [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7039.72s)]
*  of you and Eddie Bravo [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7041.72s)]
*  talking about Flat Earth. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7043.72s)]
*  Your argument there was like, [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7045.72s)]
*  this is the type of conspiracy [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7047.72s)]
*  that fucks up the other conspiracies. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7049.72s)]
*  And I believe that. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7051.72s)]
*  I'll take it a step further. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7053.72s)]
*  I think the reason [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7055.72s)]
*  why those things are [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7057.72s)]
*  so prevalent is not because [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7059.72s)]
*  they're enticing. I think people [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7061.72s)]
*  put them out there purposefully [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7063.72s)]
*  to make other conspiracy [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7065.72s)]
*  theories seem stupid. And if they can give [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7067.72s)]
*  you enough fake [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7069.72s)]
*  evidence and enough [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7071.72s)]
*  really eloquent people [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7073.72s)]
*  describing these things and why [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7075.72s)]
*  they're trying to hide this from you. And then [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7077.72s)]
*  they always attach it to religion. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7079.72s)]
*  Flat Earth is always attached to religion. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7081.72s)]
*  Really? Yeah. It's not atheist [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7083.72s)]
*  people that believe in Flat Earth for the most part. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7085.72s)]
*  I'm sure there's a few out there that do. But for the [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7087.72s)]
*  most part, they believe that there's a firmament [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7089.72s)]
*  above Earth as described in the Bible. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7091.72s)]
*  Oh, yes. Yeah, they don't believe in space. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7093.72s)]
*  Is it outer space water then? [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7095.72s)]
*  It's all just bullshit. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7097.72s)]
*  I mean, I guess that explains rain. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7099.72s)]
*  You guys are like, [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7101.72s)]
*  what the fuck is that? [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7103.72s)]
*  Like, well, up there is water. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7105.72s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know how they explain [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7107.72s)]
*  the lights. What do they think [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7109.72s)]
*  galaxies are? What do telescopes see? [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7111.72s)]
*  Are telescopes bullshit too? [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7113.72s)]
*  Yeah, water. I knew it was water. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7115.72s)]
*  Yeah, so there's a great deep below. There's [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7117.72s)]
*  the pillars of the Earth. And then there's [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7119.72s)]
*  a firmament. And then the Earth is [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7121.72s)]
*  flat. And then this bald [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7123.72s)]
*  stuff is all just bullshit. Chambres and heavens? [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7125.72s)]
*  Upper seas. They think it's like a disc. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7127.72s)]
*  I think that's how they describe it [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7129.72s)]
*  as a disc. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7131.72s)]
*  What I have here was the Bible [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7133.72s)]
*  firmament from Wikipedia. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7135.72s)]
*  Then there's the springing in [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7137.72s)]
*  the flat part. Yeah, so Earth is flat. So this [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7139.72s)]
*  is what they think it is. That's what they [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7141.72s)]
*  think it is. But the Bible firmament makes sense [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7143.72s)]
*  again if you're like, what the fuck is rain? [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7145.72s)]
*  Because that would [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7147.72s)]
*  rock me. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7149.72s)]
*  I mean, we have a real problem [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7151.72s)]
*  in that a lot [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7153.72s)]
*  of these religious [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7155.72s)]
*  texts, [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7157.72s)]
*  they're describing things that we now [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7159.72s)]
*  have science for. Yeah. There's [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7161.72s)]
*  a real problem with that. Like everything. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7163.72s)]
*  Including procreation. Like we actually know [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7165.72s)]
*  what's happening now. We can fucking watch the sperm [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7167.72s)]
*  get in the egg. We know [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7169.72s)]
*  we have photos [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7171.72s)]
*  of other planets. Like we have like really [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7173.72s)]
*  good photos of the moon. We have super good photos [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7175.72s)]
*  of Mars. We got a thing on [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7177.72s)]
*  Mars. It's a robot. We got [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7179.72s)]
*  satellites that are flying around Mars. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7181.72s)]
*  Imagine not knowing [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7183.72s)]
*  what sex did. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7185.72s)]
*  Right. You're like, I really want to do it. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7187.72s)]
*  And then all of a sudden a kid [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7189.72s)]
*  comes out. Occasionally a kid comes [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7191.72s)]
*  out. Right. You'd be like, this is... [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7193.72s)]
*  How'd that happen? [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7195.72s)]
*  If you go way, way, way back, [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7197.72s)]
*  they probably had [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7199.72s)]
*  no idea that it was their kid. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7201.72s)]
*  You see some dogs do it, you're like, oh, that's done. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7203.72s)]
*  Well, people always [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7205.72s)]
*  did it just like the gorillas of the zoo always did. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7207.72s)]
*  Of course, but I'm saying like, you wouldn't [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7209.72s)]
*  be able to explain anything. Rain [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7211.72s)]
*  would be... Oh, yeah. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7213.72s)]
*  You'd be like, there must be water up there. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7215.72s)]
*  How about lightning? How about people dying [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7217.72s)]
*  from lightning? Like getting fucking [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7219.72s)]
*  hit by lightning? You'd be like, oh my god. Magic is real. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7221.72s)]
*  Imagine. You're living [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7223.72s)]
*  50,000 years ago and your friend gets [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7225.72s)]
*  killed by lightning in front of you. Like magic [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7227.72s)]
*  is real. I was [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7229.72s)]
*  watching this dude get fucked up in a parking [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7231.72s)]
*  lot the other day. This guy was [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7233.72s)]
*  not real life on video. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7235.72s)]
*  It was another Instagram thing that I keep getting [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7237.72s)]
*  I think Sigur might have sent me this one too. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7239.72s)]
*  Some dude is walking in this parking lot [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7241.72s)]
*  and he just gets fucking nailed. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7243.72s)]
*  By lightning? Just the finger of the [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7245.72s)]
*  god. Just... [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7247.72s)]
*  Thor himself. I mean, [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7249.72s)]
*  what is... It's just as scary as [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7251.72s)]
*  like a demon taking you. Yeah, yeah. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7253.72s)]
*  It's just as scary. If you don't [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7255.72s)]
*  survive, I'll take it. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7257.72s)]
*  That's a good out. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7259.72s)]
*  Right. Struck by lightning? Yeah. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7261.72s)]
*  That's a good out. It's a good way to go. If you don't [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7263.72s)]
*  survive. If you survive, that [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7265.72s)]
*  blows. There's a guy who survived like [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7267.72s)]
*  seven. Yeah. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7269.72s)]
*  The most electrocuted guy of all time. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7271.72s)]
*  My friend Remy got nailed. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7273.72s)]
*  Do you know a guy that got struck by [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7275.72s)]
*  lightning? Yeah, yeah, yeah. When he was a kid. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7277.72s)]
*  He told a story on the podcast, [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7279.72s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. I'm trying to remember [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7281.72s)]
*  how old he was. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7283.72s)]
*  When it went down. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7285.72s)]
*  But he was a kid. I know that for [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7287.72s)]
*  sure. And he was... I think he [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7289.72s)]
*  went deaf for a little while. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7291.72s)]
*  At least in one ear. He was really [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7293.72s)]
*  fucked up. He said he didn't understand [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7295.72s)]
*  what happened when he woke up. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7297.72s)]
*  He woke up, there's no one around. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7299.72s)]
*  He just got nailed by lightning. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7301.72s)]
*  People do [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7303.72s)]
*  live. Quite a few people live. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7305.72s)]
*  But quite a few people don't. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7307.72s)]
*  Just imagine if you had no idea [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7309.72s)]
*  what electro- Yeah, think if [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7311.72s)]
*  it strikes something near you, [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7313.72s)]
*  you live. If it's like [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7315.72s)]
*  a direct strike. No, you can get hit and live. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7317.72s)]
*  People have gotten hit and lived. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7319.72s)]
*  Yeah, believe it or not. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7321.72s)]
*  But there's different kinds of lightning [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7323.72s)]
*  strikes, right? There's lightning strikes that [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7325.72s)]
*  split trees in half. If you get hit [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7327.72s)]
*  one of those bitches, you're fucked. You're exploding. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7329.72s)]
*  You know, you see them branches in the sky [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7331.72s)]
*  like some of our fucking thick. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7333.72s)]
*  You get hit one of them [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7335.72s)]
*  thick streams. Explode on a golf [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7337.72s)]
*  course. Do you know that that's what [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7339.72s)]
*  they used to think that rain was? It was God [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7341.72s)]
*  jizzing on the earth? [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7343.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's in the [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7345.72s)]
*  Dead Sea Scrolls. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7347.72s)]
*  I mean, they're kind of right. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7349.72s)]
*  It does bring life. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7351.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's what they thought it was. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7353.72s)]
*  I mean, they're kind of still correct. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7355.72s)]
*  If they were just figuring out that if you [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7357.72s)]
*  first of all, they were just learning how to write things down. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7359.72s)]
*  Right. And they're just figuring out that [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7361.72s)]
*  you have orgasm inside of a woman. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7363.72s)]
*  She can get pregnant. They're just figuring [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7365.72s)]
*  this out. So they probably would [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7367.72s)]
*  see rain come down and they [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7369.72s)]
*  realize that all these things would grow [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7371.72s)]
*  out of the rain. That's come. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7373.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's God coming on the earth. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7375.72s)]
*  And they figure that's how God [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7377.72s)]
*  Yeah, they're out there just trying to [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7379.72s)]
*  I mean, God gives all life [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7381.72s)]
*  with his come. I don't think they thought [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7383.72s)]
*  come was bad back then. They probably thought it was like super [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7385.72s)]
*  valuable. But there's a book [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7387.72s)]
*  there's literally a book based [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7389.72s)]
*  on some of the things that they [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7391.72s)]
*  think from this. It's called The Sacred [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7393.72s)]
*  Mushroom and the Cross [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7395.72s)]
*  by this guy named John Marco Allegro [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7397.72s)]
*  who was a, he was an ordained [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7399.72s)]
*  minister. But he became [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7401.72s)]
*  agnostic as he started studying theology. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7403.72s)]
*  And then [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7405.72s)]
*  he was one of the people that was [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7407.72s)]
*  he was [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7409.72s)]
*  sent to decipher the Dead Sea [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7411.72s)]
*  Scrolls, which is like the old [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7413.72s)]
*  oldest version. You're fucking [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7415.72s)]
*  Bud Light. Bud Light is [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7417.72s)]
*  coming in my throat. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7419.72s)]
*  Don't [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7421.72s)]
*  you dare, don't you dare put that on [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7423.72s)]
*  this. So this dude, one of the [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7425.72s)]
*  things that he [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7427.72s)]
*  came up with at the end of this [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7429.72s)]
*  14 year deciphering [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7431.72s)]
*  of the Dead Sea Scrolls was [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7433.72s)]
*  he thinks that Christ [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7435.72s)]
*  was an ancient Sumerian [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7437.72s)]
*  word. He traced it back to the roots [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7439.72s)]
*  of an ancient Sumerian word, which [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7441.72s)]
*  meant a mushroom covered in [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7443.72s)]
*  God's semen. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7445.72s)]
*  So apparently they had a word [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7447.72s)]
*  that for [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7449.72s)]
*  a mushroom. And they thought [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7451.72s)]
*  that when God came [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7453.72s)]
*  on the earth and the mushrooms raised up, [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7455.72s)]
*  when you eat the mushrooms and trip your balls, [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7457.72s)]
*  you're experiencing God. Which [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7459.72s)]
*  makes sense. Yeah. It totally makes [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7461.72s)]
*  sense. If you live in 50,000 years ago, [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7463.72s)]
*  if you're living today, yeah, you find some [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7465.72s)]
*  magic mushrooms. You start chomping on them [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7467.72s)]
*  and the next thing you know, you're like, [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7469.72s)]
*  the universe opens up with all [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7471.72s)]
*  its secrets to you. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7473.72s)]
*  We're all connected. If that [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7475.72s)]
*  happens to you today. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7477.72s)]
*  Fuck, that was definitely cum. Yeah, it's God's cum. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7479.72s)]
*  Imagine if God's cum [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7483.72s)]
*  was the only way you could achieve enlightenment. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7485.72s)]
*  You had to blow God. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7487.72s)]
*  That's not, yeah, I would do, [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7489.72s)]
*  I don't need enlightenment. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7491.72s)]
*  But if that was it, that was it. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7493.72s)]
*  It's like, this is what you're scared of. You're just scared of sucking a dick. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7495.72s)]
*  Don't be scared. Don't you want [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7497.72s)]
*  to be enlightened? [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7499.72s)]
*  Or do you want to just like live this life over [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7501.72s)]
*  and over and over again and never get it right? [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7503.72s)]
*  Well, what is enlightenment? What does that entail? [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7505.72s)]
*  Freedom. Complete freedom [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7507.72s)]
*  of mind. Being connected to the [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7509.72s)]
*  God source. Being [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7511.72s)]
*  one with the universe. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7513.72s)]
*  Always happy. Always filled [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7515.72s)]
*  with love. Understanding it. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7517.72s)]
*  Getting the big picture. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7519.72s)]
*  Well, literally. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7521.72s)]
*  Literally. The only way to get there [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7523.72s)]
*  is you gotta suck God off. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7525.72s)]
*  Imagine if that was the thing. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7527.72s)]
*  That sounds stupid, right? [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7529.72s)]
*  God tried to test a guy [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7531.72s)]
*  in the Bible to kill his kid. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7533.72s)]
*  You don't think God would like [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7535.72s)]
*  get you right to the point where you're at the tip [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7537.72s)]
*  and he'd go, psych? Yeah, [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7539.72s)]
*  just for the record, you were gonna do it. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7541.72s)]
*  You fucking loser. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7543.72s)]
*  You suck. You almost sucked my dick. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7545.72s)]
*  You really think that if [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7547.72s)]
*  God would have you suck his dick? [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7549.72s)]
*  I could have anybody suck my dick. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7551.72s)]
*  I'm God. Why would I want to get [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7553.72s)]
*  this fucking stand-up comedian to suck my dick? [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7555.72s)]
*  Damn, that is a philosophical question. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7557.72s)]
*  It is if you think about what God [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7559.72s)]
*  forced people to do [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7561.72s)]
*  in the Bible. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7563.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7565.72s)]
*  Who were the two brothers? [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7567.72s)]
*  Or the father and the son? [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7569.72s)]
*  Who was the father and the son, rather? [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7571.72s)]
*  Oh, that was Abraham and [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7573.72s)]
*  Yeah, I don't remember his name. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7575.72s)]
*  Fuck, what was that kid's name? [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7577.72s)]
*  I don't remember either. It was that pussy's name, dude. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7579.72s)]
*  Imagine [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7581.72s)]
*  one lady [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7583.72s)]
*  Isaac, fuck. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7585.72s)]
*  Imagine one lady [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7587.72s)]
*  eats an apple. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7589.72s)]
*  And he's like, I'm done with you people. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7591.72s)]
*  I'm done with the whole race [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7593.72s)]
*  forever, no more love, [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7595.72s)]
*  no more Eden, no more beautiful, [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7597.72s)]
*  perfect world, because one person ate an apple. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7599.72s)]
*  Do you think [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7601.72s)]
*  that's ridiculous that that same God would want you to suck his dick? [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7603.72s)]
*  Sounds like a crazy guy. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7605.72s)]

*  A bitch of a time, yeah. Yeah. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7937.72s)]
*  But like, you know, [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7939.72s)]
*  a guy would have to be so tough that you knew [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7941.72s)]
*  what he was saying. Yeah. Or you're crazy. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7943.72s)]

*  You're not [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7951.72s)]
*  man enough to give him Mike Will. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7953.72s)]
*  Fuck you too, you love me. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7955.72s)]
*  Bro. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7957.72s)]
*  I used to have a bit about that. That might be the number one scariest. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7959.72s)]
*  I used to have a bit about that. I was like, do you know how long [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7961.72s)]
*  that would take? He would have to [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7963.72s)]
*  fuck you for years. And you would have [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7965.72s)]
*  to trust you that you loved him. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7967.72s)]
*  Yeah. You'd have to decide. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7969.72s)]
*  Stockholm's Cockholm Syndrome. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7971.72s)]
*  You're lying. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7973.72s)]
*  Get back in there. But that is [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7975.72s)]
*  a case of a guy [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7977.72s)]
*  who thinks he's protected by laws [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7979.72s)]
*  getting out of line [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7981.72s)]

*  of the greatest boxers of all time. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7985.72s)]
*  You're just insulting him, saying [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7987.72s)]
*  you should be in a straight jacket. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7989.72s)]
*  How about [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7991.72s)]
*  shut your mouth and write things [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7993.72s)]
*  down? Yeah. Don't provoke [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7995.72s)]
*  that guy. Are you fucking crazy? [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7997.72s)]
*  He just bit Lennox [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=7999.72s)]
*  Lewis. You don't think he'll punch you? [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8001.72s)]
*  This is a Reddit post [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8003.72s)]
*  from Scoop Malinowski, who was [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8005.72s)]
*  the reporter who [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8007.72s)]
*  did that quote. Nine years ago. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8009.72s)]
*  Oh, that's the guy? We were trying [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8011.72s)]
*  to figure out who he was. I found out the other day, but you guys [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8013.72s)]
*  were so far along, I didn't want to bring it back up, but since [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8015.72s)]
*  you did now. Nine years ago he wrote this. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8017.72s)]
*  I was thinking, yeah, yeah, yeah, I talk [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8019.72s)]
*  about it all the time. I want to know who this guy is, because [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8021.72s)]
*  it's so crazy to have that guy [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8023.72s)]
*  screaming at you. How terrifying [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8025.72s)]
*  must have been. So I was thinking, why is [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8027.72s)]
*  anybody doing anything to stop this mad [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8029.72s)]
*  man who just assaulted the heavyweight champ [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8031.72s)]
*  and then came out grabbing his nuts [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8033.72s)]
*  and sneering and swearing at the crowd. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8035.72s)]
*  First I booed him from row [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8037.72s)]
*  seven. He did not like that [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8039.72s)]
*  and he shot me a glare. Then [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8041.72s)]
*  we turned his back. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8043.72s)]
*  I yelled, put him in a straight jacket. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8045.72s)]
*  That's when all hell broke loose. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8047.72s)]
*  For the first two to three seconds, I almost had [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8049.72s)]
*  a heart attack. LOL. But [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8051.72s)]
*  then I froze and we just [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8053.72s)]
*  looked each other in the eye for [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8055.72s)]
*  about a minute as he did his tirade. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8057.72s)]
*  I kept my cool, which seems [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8059.72s)]
*  to fluster him at the end, as [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8061.72s)]
*  he became embarrassed and even seemed [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8063.72s)]
*  to have tears in his eyes. It was [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8065.72s)]
*  a bad period in his life. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8067.72s)]
*  He knew he was going to lose to Lewis and [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8069.72s)]
*  despite the thirty million dollar payday, he was still [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8071.72s)]
*  going to be in debt [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8073.72s)]
*  as his purse was going to all [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8075.72s)]
*  his creditors. His second wife was also [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8077.72s)]
*  divorcing him, so it was a rock bottom [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8079.72s)]
*  time for Tyson. This guy is like psychologically [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8081.72s)]
*  examining Tyson now. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8083.72s)]
*  He has since turned his life around [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8085.72s)]
*  and become a positive example. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8087.72s)]
*  I actually had dinner with him [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8089.72s)]
*  after the memorial for our mutual friend [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8091.72s)]
*  and the artist Leroy Nieman [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8093.72s)]
*  a couple years ago. Oh, that's interesting. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8095.72s)]
*  I had ringside lounge in [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8097.72s)]
*  Jersey City, New Jersey. We even did an interview [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8099.72s)]
*  about tennis. He said Navratro Llova [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8101.72s)]
*  is the greatest, not Serena. We also [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8103.72s)]
*  spent time together [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8105.72s)]
*  at the New Jersey block. This is also random. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8107.72s)]
*  I also attended two of his Undisputed [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8109.72s)]
*  Truth shows on the Broadway [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8111.72s)]

*  Mike is at Peace [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8117.72s)]
*  Now in a great place. He's very busy involved [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8119.72s)]
*  in many projects. I'm happy to say it looks like [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8121.72s)]
*  it will ultimately be a happy ending, not a tragic [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8123.72s)]
*  one for Mike Tyson when the day comes [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8125.72s)]
*  decades down the road. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8127.72s)]
*  Thanks for asking. That's a good [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8129.72s)]
*  pussy. Fuck that guy. Kind of, but also [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8131.72s)]
*  he's a journalist. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8133.72s)]
*  That's the most journalist shit ever. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8135.72s)]
*  He was wrong. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8137.72s)]
*  You yelled, he put him in a [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8139.72s)]
*  straitjacket. Right. He definitely didn't [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8141.72s)]
*  provoke him. And if that guy made eye contact [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8143.72s)]
*  with Mike while he was yelling that for a minute, [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8145.72s)]

*  in the room. Maybe. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8151.72s)]
*  If Mike knew who he was. No, no, no, no, no. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8153.72s)]
*  I bet Mike forgave him. I guarantee [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8155.72s)]

*  is a head kick knockout. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8503.72s)]
*  There is no wilder thing to see. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8505.72s)]

*  Becomes the UFC welterweight champ. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8533.72s)]
*  In a fight he was losing. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8535.72s)]
*  And head kicks him. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8537.72s)]
*  Boom, and walks off. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8539.72s)]

*  See, you can find the actual head kick. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8547.72s)]
*  Because when he head kicked him, he doesn't even think about following up. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8549.72s)]

*  It's joyful. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8675.72s)]
*  The fact that his nickname is Rocky. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8677.72s)]
*  And then the fact that this is [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8679.72s)]
*  literally one of the most spectacular [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8681.72s)]
*  victories in the history of the sport. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8683.72s)]
*  Holy shit, man. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8685.72s)]
*  I watch... [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8687.72s)]
*  I fall down the same rabbit hole every time I watch UFC. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8689.72s)]
*  I watch Connor Nate 1. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8691.72s)]
*  Then I watch Nate Leon. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8693.72s)]
*  Nate Leon's like my favorite. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8695.72s)]
*  It's a great fight. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8697.72s)]
*  It's so funny. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8699.72s)]
*  When Nate starts hitting him. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8701.72s)]
*  When Nate cracked him and rocked him. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8703.72s)]
*  Then he points at him. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8705.72s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8707.72s)]
*  Because he was losing that fight. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8709.72s)]
*  I mean, Leon was doing moves. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8711.72s)]
*  He was doing spinning elbows to the head. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8713.72s)]
*  All Nate would give him was like... [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8715.72s)]
*  Oh, that one worked. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8717.72s)]
*  That's it, dude. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8719.72s)]
*  Then he starts running from him. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8721.72s)]
*  When Leon A-flex him off. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8723.72s)]
*  He almost had him. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8727.72s)]
*  He almost had him, dude. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8729.72s)]
*  He's winding up. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8731.72s)]
*  Nate literally almost had him. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8733.72s)]
*  I mean, there's multiple moments [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8735.72s)]
*  in this fight where Leon's in so much trouble. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8737.72s)]
*  After that punch. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8739.72s)]
*  That he could have got KO'd. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8741.72s)]
*  Multiple moments. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8743.72s)]
*  He's in the fire right here. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8745.72s)]
*  His legs don't work. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8747.72s)]
*  And Nate almost clipped him [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8749.72s)]
*  with the same one too. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8751.72s)]
*  I mean, he's literally running away from him. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8753.72s)]
*  And he just looked at the clock. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8755.72s)]
*  And he clipped with the right hook. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8757.72s)]
*  I mean... [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8759.72s)]
*  Nate always has the wildest cardio. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8761.72s)]
*  Him and his brother had the best cardio. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8763.72s)]
*  I watched... [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8765.72s)]
*  His brother... [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8767.72s)]
*  I was too... [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8769.72s)]
*  I wasn't into it with him. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8771.72s)]
*  Oh, my God, dude. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8773.72s)]
*  I was like, I'm gonna go home. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8775.72s)]
*  I was like, I'm gonna go home. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8777.72s)]
*  I was like, I'm gonna go home. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8779.72s)]
*  Oh, my God, dude. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8781.72s)]
*  You wanna see some wild shit? [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8783.72s)]
*  I've watched Nick vs. Anderson. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8785.72s)]
*  That's awesome. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8789.72s)]
*  He's like fucking with Anderson. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8791.72s)]
*  Yeah, when he naps on the ground. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8793.72s)]
*  That's great. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8795.72s)]
*  But you gotta go back to Paul Daly vs. Nick Diaz. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8797.72s)]
*  You wanna see a wild fight? [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8799.72s)]
*  Nick Diaz was the fucking man. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8801.72s)]
*  Dude, he had the most ridiculous cardio. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8805.72s)]
*  And Paul Daly was one of the scariest guys. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8807.72s)]
*  Paul Daly was one of the scariest strikers that's ever fought in the sport. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8809.72s)]
*  Paul Daly has like a nuclear left hand. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8813.72s)]
*  Look, he just... [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8815.72s)]
*  This is Frank Schermack. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8817.72s)]
*  He beat the fuck out of Frank Schermack in this fight. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8819.72s)]
*  And he kept talking shit to him the whole time. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8821.72s)]
*  Dude, Nick Diaz was the man. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8823.72s)]
*  And he had insane cardio. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8825.72s)]
*  The thing that he had over everybody [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8827.72s)]
*  was that, first of all, he didn't give a fuck if you hit him. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8829.72s)]
*  He wasn't worried about getting hit at all. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8831.72s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8833.72s)]
*  But on top of that, [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8835.72s)]
*  this motherfucker swam back and forth from Alcatraz. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8837.72s)]
*  He swam back from Alcatraz five times. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8841.72s)]
*  He's got insane cardio. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8843.72s)]
*  Like, does triathlons for funsies. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8847.72s)]
*  No. Yes! [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8851.72s)]
*  No, I mean that. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8853.72s)]
*  So Romskis in some ways threw caution to the wind [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8855.72s)]
*  and just gutted out the knockdown. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8857.72s)]
*  And there's blood now. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8859.72s)]
*  Dripping from the face of Nick Diaz. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8861.72s)]
*  So he would get hit by these guys who would swarm him. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8865.72s)]
*  But eventually he would start putting it on him. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8867.72s)]
*  He just never got tired, dude. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8869.72s)]
*  He just never got tired. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8871.72s)]
*  And he didn't give a fuck. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8873.72s)]
*  Like, his style is like, fuck you. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8875.72s)]
*  Just starts beating dudes up. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8877.72s)]
*  It's so fun. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8879.72s)]
*  Look, bro, look how he rips to the body. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8881.72s)]
*  I mean, Nate's great, but Nick was the real star of the family. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8883.72s)]
*  He just never got to the UFC while he was in this state. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8887.72s)]
*  If he was a UFC champion while he was in this form. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8889.72s)]
*  Because he was in a form during Strikeforce [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8893.72s)]
*  where he was fucking up everybody. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8895.72s)]
*  And not just knocking them out and beating them up. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8897.72s)]
*  Like this fight right here. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8901.72s)]
*  Go to the Frank Shamrock fight. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8903.72s)]
*  The Frank Shamrock fight. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8905.72s)]
*  Like, Frank Shamrock was a fucking legend, man. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8907.72s)]
*  Frank was a legend. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8909.72s)]
*  And he submitted a lot of guys, too. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8911.72s)]
*  That's the other thing about Nick. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8913.72s)]
*  Like, Nick had a fucking nasty guard. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8915.72s)]
*  I believe he submitted Cyborg with an armbar. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8919.72s)]
*  He was just a killer, man. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8923.72s)]
*  Just a real killer. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8925.72s)]
*  And the thing is, he would keep talking shit to you and keep punching you [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8927.72s)]
*  and you're getting tired. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8929.72s)]
*  And he stays on you. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8931.72s)]
*  And you just don't get any breathing room. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8933.72s)]
*  Look at him. Constantly, constantly. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8935.72s)]
*  Staying on you. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8937.72s)]
*  In his prime. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8939.72s)]
*  Because Frank was like the original mixed martial artist. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8941.72s)]
*  The original complete mixed martial artist. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8943.72s)]
*  And here, Nick's just beating him down. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8945.72s)]
*  It's like a true changing of the guard. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8947.72s)]
*  Like, Nick just fucking... [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8951.72s)]
*  Like, gave him... He had no chance. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8953.72s)]
*  He didn't present any problems to Nick. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8955.72s)]
*  Which is just wild. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8957.72s)]
*  To think that a guy could do that to a guy like Frank Shamrock. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8959.72s)]
*  That's how good Nick Diaz was when he was in his prime. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8961.72s)]
*  He was just doing that over in Strikeforce. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8963.72s)]
*  And the problem was the audience was just quite a bit smaller. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8967.72s)]
*  The Diaz... [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8971.72s)]
*  This is him versus... [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8973.72s)]
*  Fucking with people was so funny in this sport. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8975.72s)]
*  It's such a crazy sport. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8977.72s)]
*  And then there's a dude out there like... [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8979.72s)]
*  Flicking you off. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8981.72s)]
*  And this guy was a dangerous... This is Scott Smith. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8983.72s)]
*  This guy was a dangerous fucking striker. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8985.72s)]
*  Super dangerous. Knocked a lot of people out. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8987.72s)]
*  Knocked one of my friends out. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8989.72s)]
*  This guy was a fucking killer. And Nick just beat him. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8991.72s)]
*  He knocks one of your friends out? [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8993.72s)]
*  You guys just having fun? [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8995.72s)]
*  No, they were in a UFC fight. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8997.72s)]
*  But this guy was super dangerous. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=8999.72s)]
*  This is another guy that just had ridiculous knockout power. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9001.72s)]
*  Just tough as shit. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9007.72s)]
*  But you're just dealing with a guy and Nick that literally never got tired. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9009.72s)]
*  Was as game as they came. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9013.72s)]
*  Didn't give a fuck. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9015.72s)]
*  Just in there having fun. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9017.72s)]
*  Dude, he had one of his fights overturned. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9021.72s)]
*  Because he was literally high while he was fighting. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9023.72s)]
*  So he had the Gomi fight. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9025.72s)]
*  So they said no? [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9027.72s)]
*  They overturned it because it was invasions. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9029.72s)]
*  They did something. They overturned the decision. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9031.72s)]
*  Because he tested positive for weed? [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9033.72s)]
*  He was fucking high. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9035.72s)]
*  That's not good. That's not going to help you in a fight. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9037.72s)]
*  I bet it would. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9039.72s)]
*  Maybe for them. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9041.72s)]
*  Find Nick Diaz. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9043.72s)]
*  So good. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9047.72s)]
*  Nick Diaz... I think it was Gomi. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9049.72s)]
*  I think it was Gomi that he submitted. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9051.72s)]
*  Pretty sure it was Gomi. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9053.72s)]
*  Gomi was a super dangerous guy from Japan. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9055.72s)]
*  Who was a baseball player. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9057.72s)]
*  That converted into fighting. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9059.72s)]
*  And he would throw a right hand. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9061.72s)]
*  Literally like a fucking fastball man. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9063.72s)]
*  It was crazy. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9067.72s)]
*  Yeah, so... [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9069.72s)]
*  Nick is putting it on him. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9071.72s)]
*  But Gomi cracked him. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9073.72s)]
*  Gomi cracked him and hurt him at one point in time. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9075.72s)]
*  And he got like a big cut over one of his cheeks. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9077.72s)]
*  Everybody is so tired fighting these dudes. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9079.72s)]
*  Well this is just... [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9081.72s)]
*  This is how Nick would do people. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9083.72s)]
*  He would just put it on them. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9085.72s)]
*  No, you got to go a little bit back up so you see what happened. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9087.72s)]
*  Yeah, but this is it. Just go right here. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9089.72s)]
*  So what happened was... [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9091.72s)]
*  Nick was putting it on him and Gomi tried to take him down. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9093.72s)]
*  And Nick put him in a go-go plot. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9095.72s)]
*  Did they not show it? [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9097.72s)]
*  Oh, here it is. Oh, they're going to show it here. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9099.72s)]
*  So here Nick is beating him up. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9101.72s)]
*  And then Gomi goes to try to take him down. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9103.72s)]
*  And Nick gets him in a wild maneuver. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9105.72s)]
*  Look at that. He's got his shin across the dude's neck. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9107.72s)]
*  It's a go-go plot. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9109.72s)]
*  I mean, it's like a crazy move to pull off an MMA. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9111.72s)]
*  Almost never happens. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9113.72s)]
*  And for Nick to pull it off on Gomi high as a kite... [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9115.72s)]
*  Wait, this is the fight he lost because he was high? [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9117.72s)]
*  Yes! [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9119.72s)]
*  His eyes fucked during the... [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9121.72s)]
*  Because this fight... [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9123.72s)]
*  This was Pride. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9125.72s)]
*  Pride had one event that was in Las Vegas. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9127.72s)]
*  I'm 90% sure of that. Check on that. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9129.72s)]
*  I think that... [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9131.72s)]
*  I believe that was Pride. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9133.72s)]
*  I think that... [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9135.72s)]
*  I believe that fight was in Vegas. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9137.72s)]
*  Which was the problem. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9139.72s)]
*  We out of beers? Yeah. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9141.72s)]
*  Well, we should probably wrap this up anyway. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9143.72s)]
*  We've been here three hours at least. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9145.72s)]
*  Really? I think. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9147.72s)]
*  Yeah, right? [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9149.72s)]
*  Give or take? [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9151.72s)]
*  Yeah. 2.30 on my clock. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9153.72s)]
*  The second we get to Diaz Highlights [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m6aoc0Uhc8&t=9155.72s)]
