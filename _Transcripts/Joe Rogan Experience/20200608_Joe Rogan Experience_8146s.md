# JRE MMA Show #97 with Henry Cejudo
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 08, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFEWPtIFTAg)
*  Henry saho, how are you sir? I'm doing good. Good to see you man. Thank you for having me.
*  What does it feel like? What does it feel like having stepped back? You step away, you get to look at it from a fresh perspective. What does this feel like?
*  It feels good man. It feels, I think the biggest thing with me Joe is there's satisfaction in my life. You know what I'm saying? I've done so much in the sport.
*  And I can compare myself a little bit to Daniel. You know if Daniel would have beat Stipe Miochik and he would have retired on top, you could almost say retired as a two division world champ.
*  And I don't feel like I have that chip on my shoulder. You know as a wrestler I retired from the Olympics at a very young age.
*  You know decided to come back three years later but you know what I mean? It was already done. You know what I mean? I retired at the age of 21.
*  And then now at the age of 33 I'm truly calling it quits unless there's a couple fights that if I do come back.
*  I like that word unless. I like that word.
*  Yeah and as you know and a little bit it's, before it was about the money a little bit with the UFC. And obviously you know everybody does have a price.
*  But I think there's a fight that I would really like in the UFC and that would be against Alexander Volkonovsky.
*  Yeah at 45.
*  At 45. If they're to give me an opportunity to go up and obviously be compensated.
*  Then that would be a fight that would really wake me up in the morning. Be like hey man this is a challenge. This is a whole new mountain.
*  A chance to be a three division world champion.
*  A chance to be a three division world champion. As you know a lot of people have counted me out. Against Demetrius, against TJ, against Marlon. Maybe it was you too Joe.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  And I think that's what I love about it.
*  You can't find any evidence of me counting you out sir. Never.
*  So I love that. I love challenges since I was a kid. I knew I was different. I knew I was special.
*  What is it that you knew? What separates you?
*  Oh my god. I think it's a couple of things. If I was to explain it to you. What's made me successful.
*  And I've seen it. You know being at the Olympic training center as a high school kid and living out there for four years.
*  And that's actually where I met Daniel. I was a 16 year old kid when I first met these guys.
*  And I was able to analyze a lot of the greats like you know Stephen Abbis, Daniel Cormier. A lot of the Olympic team.
*  And what I've learned now at the age of 33 I learned that there's been two things that have separated me from the rest of the pack.
*  It's two things. It's what I call heart and ability.
*  And I was actually able to tell this story to Chachri the founder and CEO of 1FC.
*  And you know so it's two things. I call it heart and ability. What is your heart? Your heart is your passion. Your will, your desire.
*  Your determination. Your heart is something that you're willing to suffer for in order to obtain.
*  Now the next one is ability. You know ability is a gift that you have since you know it's a coordination.
*  It's something that you've repped over time where you become a master at it.
*  And what happens a lot of time I always tell people it's good to question one or the other. It's good to question the mind.
*  I'm sorry I'm sorry the heart or the ability because to be the 1% of the 1% is like both these things have to match.
*  What happens is a lot of people have heart but their ability is like way down here.
*  You know their ability doesn't match their heart or their ability is up here and they're just a little lazy and can't really put the...
*  Because there is a separation between mind and body and your job is to connect them both.
*  And I'm going to use an example with Marlon Marais. You saw me getting my ass kicked. You saw me getting leg kicked.
*  You know from the first all the way to the second round but I knew that I had to connect it and make that transition.
*  That was a combination of combining the heart and the ability.
*  You know so I was able to kind of... So what separated me I'd say that I think is being gifted through the ability.
*  And then just having a passion or will that's just second to none.
*  There's a lot of other factors though isn't there? There's like not just ability.
*  It's also you have to be coached by someone who really knows what they're doing.
*  There's so many guys out there that are really tough and they have will and they work out hard and they're in shape.
*  But they just make technical mistakes and they've never corrected those mistakes.
*  Yeah well I think that also goes back on the ability. I would put that into the ability portion.
*  The reason why is because you got to put yourself in the right situations.
*  Like I didn't start winning until I let go of my coaches.
*  The first time I lost to Demetrious Johnson it was... Man it was hard and this sounds very crazy and cynical but it was kind of hard to blame myself.
*  Even though I was training because I knew coming from an Olympic sport that I had a coach that could take me to the top and there was no ifs or what's like.
*  I knew he knew the recipe and it may was still a fairly new and it's still a fairly new sport.
*  So I knew that I had to find the professors. I knew that I had to find the scientists and all this together in order for me to become that perfect storm.
*  So that's exactly what we did. Putting the science, the recovery, finding the right coaches, listening to my ability, understanding my biomechanics.
*  It was a mixture of all these things that separated me from the first time I fought Demetrious.
*  To just being a legend killer. To beating all these guys that they said. Demetrious Johnson, TJ, Marlon Mariah's dominant crews. That's a hell of a list Joe.
*  It's a hell of a list.
*  It's one of the reasons why it bums me out that you retired.
*  Conflicting feelings. One, I'm happy. I'm happy you retired. Young and healthy and you can do anything you want.
*  I really believe a guy who can accomplish what you accomplished inside the octagon and also winning an Olympic gold medalist.
*  You're winning an Olympic gold medal in wrestling at 21 years old. Retiring from the sport, then getting into MMA.
*  Being coming a two division world champion in MMA and then stepping away while you're still healthy and at the peak of your abilities.
*  Part of me loves that. I love the fact that you did what you wanted to do and then you step away.
*  But part of me looks back at like say when you fought Benavides or say when you fought Demetrious the first time and then looks at you now.
*  Like you're a completely different animal.
*  Nobody had been able to shut down Dominic Cruz's footwork game.
*  But you came in and just chopped the shit out of his legs. Just right off the bat.
*  Whatever advantage we thought that he would have with his footwork and movement was actually becoming a disadvantage.
*  Because you were using that against him. You found the angles and you found the perfect times to attack his legs.
*  And then you put him away. Which is also something no one's ever done before except Uriah caught him in a submission and finished him.
*  But no one's ever put him away the way you did.
*  I think it's all about game planning. I think the ability that I have that separates me too is the fact that I'm...
*  Watch all my fights. I fight everybody different. I really do. There's times where I have to use wrestling as I did with Demetrious.
*  Well the Wilson-Hays fight is a great example. You came out like a karate guy. I was like holy shit look at this.
*  You were like Wonderboy sideways stamps like hands down. You really fought like a karate guy.
*  And then when you caught him with that straight punch and dropped him I was like look at this shit. This is crazy. You fought a different style.
*  Yeah and I think with Dominic too just to get back to him. In order for you to understand the funk you have to train for the funk.
*  If you don't train for Dominic if you think you can just go out there and just fight or train the way you train and try to fight Dominic you're going to be missing.
*  So throughout my training camps I treated almost like a wrestler, like a boxer. My training camp I build a team around me.
*  I have a mentor actually who's here, Dave Zoan who's been helping me to shape. He's a businessman but he's been able to help me to form the perfect storm.
*  We brought guys in from California that mimic just like Dominic. They were just a little faster than Dominic.
*  And I knew that I wasn't even trying to touch his face because I knew that he was a hard hit. But I also knew that he would leave his legs a lot.
*  You can push your body backwards but your legs will always be in that same position. So the whole game plan since the beginning.
*  This is why I felt so confident in that fight. Through training was to continue to just keep taking his legs out as much as I can.
*  Did the first round of your fight with Marlon Marais sort of open your eyes to how effective that can be in a fight?
*  Absolutely man. We saw it this weekend. You mentioned it actually. I was a little bummed out that you mentioned it because a lot of people don't see those little details.
*  Those cap kicks. You start to take out that lead leg and you lose your mobility.
*  It's insane how we've had all these years of MMA. 1993 the UFC starts. Here we are in 2020. But it's really only been the last two years or so.
*  I give credit to Benson Henderson because Benson Henderson was the first guy to really bring it to MMA.
*  But for whatever reason it wasn't as devastating when he was doing it. I don't know if he was doing it differently.
*  But there was no moment in a fight where he kicked someone's calf and you saw immediately them buckling.
*  But you're seeing that now with these guys. Immediately one, two kicks and their leg is semi-useless.
*  Yeah you look at somebody like Justin Gaethje. If people don't catch on to that, if Khabib don't catch on to that, he's in trouble.
*  And I know them both. He said wide out in the open. He said when I fight Khabib, I'm not even going to try to kick him in his thighs.
*  I'm just going to kick him with that low calf kick. He goes I'm going to kick him four times. After four times he's fucked.
*  And he saw that. You watched the fight with him and Etimb Barbosa. And Etimb Barbosa is a high level striker.
*  But what really broke down Etimb Barbosa was what Justin did to him. He started whipping that calf kick.
*  And actually right before I even fought Dominic, I went on YouTube, maybe an hour before I went to the arena.
*  And I just put some Justin Gaethje highlights. Just ruthless, man. Just swinging those kids with bad intentions.
*  And the problem is just to murder you. And also the reason why I've been able to kick and do things like that is because I'm very comfortable in my takedown defense.
*  It's like John Jones. John Jones is so comfortable with the stand up because he knows his ability to stop Tony from taking him down is so much higher.
*  And I feel that same way so I become a little more free with my kicks and punches and things of that matter.
*  We saw two guys in one of the weight classes that you ruled over, Alex Perez and Jussie Formiga this past weekend.
*  And Alex Perez stopped him with those low leg kicks. Two UFCs in a row. We've seen guys get stopped with low leg kicks. It's crazy.
*  It's crazy how prominent that technique has become.
*  It has. It has. And I think we're going to start seeing more of it. So people are going to have to start adjusting that because there's two stoppages.
*  And then there's a stoppage before Alex Perez recently that came up.
*  Yeah, last week. Last week of the stoppage. I forget who was fighting.
*  But it was another stoppage because leg kicks. In that stoppage, the dude crushed both of his legs. I apologize for not remembering the names.
*  I didn't call that fight either. If I called it, I'd probably remember it.
*  But the low leg kick is just a gigantic factor. When you were fighting Marlon Marais, it seemed like he was a bit of a step ahead of you in the first round.
*  But you made some serious adjustments in between. It was like two different fights.
*  It was like the first round was like, damn, this is not going well for Henry. And then going into the second round, like, damn, this is not going well for Marlon.
*  It was a totally different fight. It's like you figured the adjustment out, figured out what you needed to do. You stepped in further.
*  You were closer and you started attacking. Yeah. And I think a lot of that too, Joe.
*  And if I was, I know how to, I know when to fight and when to compete.
*  And when Marlon, first I went in there with the sprained ankle. This is why I had my like my ankle tape.
*  And actually Marlon's team had heard me scream on Tuesday night when all this happened. So they knew I was somewhat injured.
*  So I think their game plan. When did you scream? I twisted my ankle between the USC mats.
*  Like, you know, that has some cheap tape. And then between the mats when I stepped in, like my rolled my ankle like bad, bad.
*  I have pictures of it. It's like black and black and blue. But I still wanted to fight.
*  So, you know, so anyway, so, you know, I went in there, heard it or not.
*  But I knew that that first round and you said you mentioned it too during the fight.
*  He says, I think this might be a survival round for Henry. And it absolutely was.
*  So I knew when to fight and when to compete. But I also knew that Marlon was throwing so much power.
*  And I've gone, I've gone against some of the best in the world.
*  There's like, dude, there's no way he's going to be able to maintain all that power for five rounds.
*  And I don't think this kid has any idea as a wrestler, because he's never wrestled before, how much pain a guy like me can endure.
*  So he can say he was tired. He can say that something happened. But in reality, it's a mixture of two things.
*  He blew his wad and this guy, this guy here could, which is me, could take a lot of pain.
*  I was with Mike not too long ago and I asked him, I was like, hey, Mike, this is Mike Tyson.
*  I'm like, how would you describe Muhammad Ali, man? What was the difference between him and everybody else?
*  And he sat there and he thought about it and he's like, which was cool to hear, man, because I can put myself in those shoes.
*  And he's like, man, Muhammad Ali was a guy that I've never seen before because he could just endure so much pain.
*  Like the dude could just endure so much pain that it's almost like the average guy would fold.
*  The average guy would probably get killed, but Ali just had a certain will to him that separated him from everybody else.
*  It was the fact that he was able to endure pain. You don't hear that too often.
*  It's true, though. You know, if you watch his fight with Ken Norton, you know, he fought most of the fight with a broken jaw.
*  Yeah, I mean, this is heavy weights too. Yeah, man.
*  That's probably a five pound jaw too. Heavy weights, man. He fought big heavy weights.
*  I mean, George Foreman in his prime, Joe Frazier, when Joe Frazier was in his prime.
*  Same example, George Foreman, Louis Watt. He had no idea how much pain Ali could endure.
*  And how much movement Ali had going for him. Ali was so slick.
*  You know, when Ali, there's a famous video of Ali with his hands on the ropes and George is just swinging punches at him and Ali is using the ropes.
*  He's holding on to the ropes and using the ropes and he's not even putting his hands up at all.
*  And the most murderous puncher up to that time since Sonny Liston in the history of the heavyweight division.
*  You got like Joe Frazier was a power puncher. Joe Lewis was a sniper. He was an excellent power puncher.
*  But George Foreman would lift people in the air. Yeah, he would hit people like you ever see his first knockout with Joe Frazier?
*  Yeah, he had knocked him on many files. He right after he beat Frazier.
*  When he fought Frazier, he literally lifted him in the air with a punch. That's how hard Joe Frazier would hit.
*  And Ali, no hands up. Just holding on to the ropes. Doing this shit. Sitting in front of him. Leaning back, doing this shit. Crazy.
*  Yeah, but imagine how many of those punches, even though it would get hit in the face, imagine how many of those punches.
*  George Foreman was thrown at him and then Ali was just laughing and talking to him.
*  It's a certain mind power, man. It's a mind fight. That you cannot, you just cannot replicate, man. It's got to be in you.
*  Right. Or you have to have developed it over time and have complete confidence in it.
*  I think you can build mental toughness. I really do. But I think you have to be very conscious about it.
*  I think it has to be done over time. Some people build mental toughness because of their environment or because of how they grew up.
*  Or some of the bad things they've faced in their life. And some people build mental toughness out of a decision.
*  They make a decision to be mentally tough. And then they actually, they cultivate that. They work on that.
*  I think it's a mixture of both. And this is why sometimes I respect more of like the upper middle class when they become champions.
*  Especially in a rough sport like wrestling or MMA. It's because I feel like minorities or people that have gone through adversity.
*  It's like man, we have an advantage because it's through the nurture side of things. How you were raised, man.
*  I'm one of seven kids, Josh, raised by a single mother. And I was the youngest, man. So I was a kid that was picked on.
*  I was picked on by all. No, it's different when you're the smallest in an immigrant family.
*  It's like, dude, you're the last one to eat. You're going to get beat up pretty much the majority of your childhood.
*  And then you start getting to that age where you can kind of fight back. So a lot of it, I guess you owe through the nature and nurture.
*  Obviously genetics, your mother and father, but also through the nature side of it. How you were raised, man.
*  How tough are you? Like me as a kid growing up, I remember as a family, man, like hot summer days would come around.
*  Like we didn't eat, man. We didn't eat, man. Going to school was a place for us. At least I could say.
*  My family, they don't talk about that stuff so much. They're a little more private. But for me, it was like, dude, I get a chance to eat lunch and breakfast.
*  Well, that was a big problem with this COVID shit where they shut schools down and a lot of kids are in that same position where that was their opportunity to eat.
*  And some people just are not aware of that, that that's where a lot of people got their food was at school.
*  Right, right. And I was one of those kids. So if there's any of those kids or any of those guys that are adults now,
*  I'd say, hey, man, be happy for that. Because I tell you what's made me has been adversity, man, is going is understanding that that grind, that grit, man, of being angry and things like that.
*  If you're able to challenge that into something constructive. Yeah, Joe, I'm a living example, man. You are. Look at that flag behind you.
*  I represented that flag. You did, you know, and ironically, you know, my mom came to this country, you know, maybe not the most political way.
*  But she came to this country to live the American dream. Her American dream was just to make sure her kids.
*  It's a timing thing, you know, because my grandparents came over here, too. But they came over here when it was it was easy.
*  And you just signed some shit and you were in, you know, in the early 1900s. It's just look, if that's how it was today, you wouldn't have the kind of illegal immigration you have today.
*  This country was founded on people coming over here because it was easy. It was a better place to live. You have a better life for your family.
*  But there was no hoops to jump through. My grandparents just arrived. They just came here and moved in.
*  I mean, they didn't have to take any serious tests or do any crazy shit. They just came in.
*  You know, they didn't have to prove that they had some special skills.
*  Like now it's very difficult for people to come over here and to get citizenship.
*  No, it is. And I do believe even as an immigrant that there is a pathway to citizenship because you're right.
*  Times do change and you have to adjust to whatever political power is going on right now.
*  I just happen to be fortunate to my mom did it. Yeah, your mom did it. Yeah. She crossed. I'm here now.
*  I think guys like you are amazing sources of inspiration for other people that are struggling.
*  And this is crazy, Joe. So I'm going to mention something to you. It's like my mom, both my parents came here illegally. I'll just say it, man. You guys forgive me.
*  Don't tell Trump.
*  But my mom was granted her citizenship. So when I won the Olympics, my mom wasn't able to attend the 2000 Olympics due to her citizenship status.
*  So then three years later after that, she was awarded her citizenship.
*  But at the age of 20, so I stand on both fences, man. Like my dad, he was my father, which I was just raised by my mother.
*  He committed crimes in and out. He was in and out of jail here in California. He was actually deported.
*  So I was a five year old kid. My dad was deported. Never came back to America. So I understand both sides, man.
*  Like, and I hate to say this, but it's true. It's my dad came here as a foreigner as an illegal and he decided to break the law, man.
*  And rightfully so, man. He should go back to his native country. My mother came here illegally, paid her fine, paid her taxes and whatnot.
*  And then she was granted her citizenship in 2000, 2011, man.
*  So I've been able to speak on this on behalf of Congress and kind of share my story to the world, man, because, man, it's almost like I become neutral.
*  You break the law, you go, man. You obey the law after a certain amount of time, maybe you might get granted as an American.
*  Yeah. Yeah, it's a very frustrating thing for people who do want to have a better life for their family.
*  They realize how difficult it is to come here. I fully understand illegal immigration.
*  I fully understand wanting to keep out people that are criminals and people that are murderers and people that are in the drug trade.
*  But if I was a person who was struggling to feed my family in South America or in Mexico or wherever, and I found out that I could sneak in and then I could do better.
*  I would sneak in. Yeah, I would do it. 100 percent. And anybody says they wouldn't. You're lying. Yeah, you're lying.
*  If you found out there was a place across the border where you can make five times as much and you could send money back and all you had to do is grind this place where literally anybody can go from being
*  completely impoverished to being on top of the world, being a millionaire. This is the place.
*  I think the best example, man, I hate to use the example because he's burned a lot of people, is Don King.
*  Well, Don King is maybe not the best example because he was born in America. First of all, and he's a murderer, twice, twice over.
*  He's an example of a different time. And you talk to guys like Mike Tyson, he'll tell you that that guy played me. Right.
*  Yeah, you're probably right. Maybe Don King. But what I'm saying is he's been able to come out of, you know, obviously he was a murderer, but he was able to somewhat make it in the sport that he desired to be at that time.
*  Obviously, I think we all know he's a crook. But man, it lets you know what America is able to do, man.
*  Doesn't matter what you've done in life. You really do get only a second, a third, but a fourth and a thousand opportunities.
*  He's from a different era. I feel like if the internet was around, well, you know, who knows, maybe he'd be president today.
*  Look at our president, man. This is why, like, dude, Trump is the example of the American dream.
*  In many ways. Yeah. A faulty version of it. But yeah, in many ways.
*  I think the other person that I would...
*  Actually, probably not the version of the American dream because his dad was rich and he gave him money.
*  Like he started off, his dad gave him millions of dollars to start businesses.
*  Right. But I mean, he turned that into billions too.
*  He did. But he also went bankrupt a bunch of times too.
*  Yeah. You got me, Joe.
*  I mean, it's tricky. I mean, you can't deny the fact that the guy's been remarkably successful.
*  Yeah. But like the extenuating circumstances that led to that success is very different than your mother sneaking over here because she wanted to do better for her family.
*  That's the raw version of the American dream.
*  I mean, the American dream is really immigration.
*  And that's really what it... Like I'm a version of the American dream. I'm third generation American.
*  My grandparents came over here because they wanted a better life. Their parents wanted a better life.
*  They came over here from Italy and from Ireland.
*  Yeah, it's a trip, man. When you talk about things like that, you know who I think of a lot when you talk about the American dream, man.
*  I know, you know, he's... In my opinion, I feel like he's somewhat misunderstood in our MMA community or just in general, man, is Ali Abdelaziz, man.
*  A dude that came from Egypt, you know, came to America.
*  I remember Ali, I've known him for a minute since 2004.
*  You know, he would sell fubu like out. He was just hustling the whole time out of Colorado Springs.
*  And, you know, now he's got over 150 fighters. I mean, he's got five champions in the UFC.
*  I mean, this dude is... When I think of the American dream, I really do think of somebody like Ali.
*  Well, he's a very controversial guy.
*  He is. He is.
*  But his clients love him.
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
*  You know, it's hard to deny that. His clients love him.
*  I mean, there's a lot of people that say a lot of wild shit about him. I don't know how much of it's true.
*  But the bottom line is you talk to guys like Justin Gagey, guys like yourself, you know, many fighters that have had come in here that are repped by him.
*  And they love the guy.
*  Yeah, it could be.
*  Frankie, Frankie.
*  Yeah, Frankie. All these dudes, Cody, Verdun. And he's been able to... And I've been there and I've never seen this before.
*  But he's kind of like the glue with all of us.
*  Dude, I was eating lunch and dinner with Marlon.
*  Were you really?
*  Yeah, not too long.
*  Before or after the fight?
*  This is like maybe four months after my fight.
*  Oh, wow.
*  I mean, I'm sure it must have stung, but out of the respect for him.
*  And I told that to Ali. I'm like, Ali, man, these dudes good. Because I was picking on Frankie Edgar too.
*  But I was like, man, you're next, dude. You're going to bend the knee.
*  And I was like, Ali, these dudes are going to want to fight me, man. There's two against one. Who's back? He's like my brother.
*  He's like, you think they're going to do that when I'm here, man? He's like, these guys respect as much as you do.
*  And I'm just like, huh? And then we sat down. It was just like nothing ever happened, man.
*  Well, that's very cool that Marlon has that kind of character that he could sit down with you after that fight. That's very cool.
*  Yeah.
*  Marlon's an interesting guy, man. He's one of those guys that you wonder, like, is he too big for that division?
*  Like, how much weight is that man cutting? He's so fucking big. To see him get down to 135, look how shredded he is.
*  Like, what do you walk around at? Like, he looks like he walks around about 160 something.
*  Yeah, he's big. And I think I personally think that Marlon could hurt some people at 145 pounds.
*  Yeah, I think so too. Yeah. It's that risk versus reward. Like, when do you move away? When do you, you know, when do you go up?
*  When do you stay down? Like, how much are you beating your body up? And then you got some guys who go down later in their career.
*  You know, like Barbosa is a good example. Barbosa in his last fight. I thought he got robbed. I thought he won that decision.
*  And he got down to 145.
*  That's not always the answer, Joe. I mean, look at me. I was at 125 pounds. And could I still make it? Yeah, I could still make it.
*  But the fatigue that it bring to me, like the, I think the psychology side too of cutting weight, like going, going down is not always the answer.
*  And I started having my best success when I decided, like, hey, man, I'm just sick of cutting weight, man.
*  I'm getting ready to go up and, you know, challenge myself to 135 pounds. And what you hear from the naysayers is just like, man, he's just, you're too small, man.
*  You're not ready for some power like that. I'm just like, no, I don't think so.
*  I think there's an advantage of me for me to feel well. If I feel well and I feel healthy with my speed, you know, I'm a short compact fighters.
*  Trust me, I don't need that much. As long as I land, I'm going to hurt you, man. You can be 10 pounds heavier than me. It doesn't matter.
*  So there's been a lot of guys who've moved up and it's been the answer. Yeah. Masvidal. Yeah. Masvidal, Calvin. Yeah. Even Calvin has success.
*  I still think if I was, I mean, just someone gets in Kelvin's, you know, like, Calvin, we got to do this the right way.
*  There's a lot of guys way bigger than you that make 170. I think at 170, he could be a world champion. I really do.
*  Yeah, he's a scary man when he's in shape and motivated. But he just gets big. Yeah, I think he loves food. He loves Mary Jane.
*  Yeah, I think that's the thing. That's what it is. Calvin is, dude, he's one of my best friends.
*  But like we become super, super close and he's he's a very gifted, very gifted human being.
*  Like he's when you see him look, start deceiving. No, he doesn't have enough muscle definition.
*  But man, the dude's athletic ability, what he could do is counterpunch. Yeah. It's like it's it's ridiculous.
*  He's got one of the best straight left hands in the business. The one he dropped bismuth with like Jesus, it's a piston man.
*  Yeah, but I also feel like and I see that I always like I always think, OK, Calvin can make 170. I agree with you, Joe.
*  But what about that happiness portion? You know what I'm saying? Will he be happy throughout that process?
*  Maybe be happy when he lies in bed with that big ass gold belt. Maybe that's what makes him happy.
*  I got two of them. So I just don't know, Joe. Add a gold medal.
*  You the youngest guy to ever win a gold medal in the Olympics for wrestling? Yes, in 2008. That's amazing.
*  In 2016, Kyle Snyder, who if he does decide to make a transition to the UFC, a guy like Joe, Joe's would be in trouble.
*  You think? Yeah. Yeah, the dude is just just the reason why I beat Demetrius.
*  You know, obviously I beat Demetrius. It was Joe. I wouldn't be mad. I'll bring this up right now.
*  I wouldn't be mad if the judges would have gave it to Demetrius. You know what?
*  Because it was a hell of a fight and I would have been like, I mean, I almost had him.
*  But, you know, the judges, I conveyed enough to for the judges to give it to me.
*  And the reason why I was able to beat him was because I nullified a lot of his things with my wrestling, my inside tricks, my takedowns.
*  So I completely dismantled this dude. You know what I mean?
*  I took him out of his rhythm when he was used to kind of catching people and then being able to take people down.
*  So I feel like if a guy like Kyle Snyder gets in the game and he's able to kind of go through the process that I've gone through,
*  that's the only guy that I could see beating somebody like John Jones. How old is he now?
*  He's young. He's, I want to say he's 24, about to be 25. Interesting. And does he have any desire to fight?
*  He's mentioned it. He's mentioned it. But he doesn't have any experience in standup at all.
*  And that's the biggest thing, man. So a guy like that, you would have to kind of, you would have to groom him properly.
*  You don't want to stick a guy like that straight into MMA. No.
*  Put him into boxing for at least a couple years. Because this is what I did. I boxed for three years. I did amateur boxing. I competed.
*  I mean, I didn't do any Jiu-Jitsu, none of that, because I was in love with the sport of boxing.
*  My original goal, and this is crazy, this is how crazy I think, Joe, is I was trying to make the Olympic team right after 2008.
*  For boxing. For boxing. Wow. Yeah. And the reason why that idea came up, because Deontay Wilder did it.
*  Within I think it was four years, he was able to make. Year and a half.
*  Year and a half from boxing wins a bronze medal in the Olympics. Crazy, right? I was like, dude, if that dude can do it, give me a few years.
*  That's one of the, when he told me that, I'm like, that is one of the craziest stories I've ever heard in my life.
*  Ridiculous.
*  But also extremely motivated because he had a very sick daughter, and he realized that he couldn't play basketball.
*  He wasn't going to school, couldn't play football, was trying to figure out ways to make money.
*  He was driving a truck. I believe it was for Budweiser. He was driving, he was delivering things.
*  And he just decided, I'm going to get into boxing. And just had unbelievable, God-given talent.
*  And just ferocious punching power. His punching power is like nothing I've ever seen before.
*  I mean, you look at Deontay Wilder's knockouts, they don't even make sense.
*  He sends people flying across the ring. And when he fought Tyson Fury, the first fight, when he dropped him and knocked him down twice, he only weighed 209 pounds.
*  It's crazy.
*  209 pounds.
*  209 pounds.
*  That's a heavyweight. It's crazy.
*  And you know, he's fighting Tyson Fury. He was an enormous heavyweight. And like, he hits guys, man, like nobody else.
*  What Tyson had over him, though, that he showed in the technical side of it in the second fight was his boxing.
*  His understanding of the game is so complex. It's so much different.
*  Whereas Deontay has just this ferocious power and he figures out how to put it on you.
*  But when you can knock out a guy like Luis Ortiz with a fucking right hand to the forehead, he looks like you're shot by it.
*  Goal medalist, right? Ortiz? Yeah. That's crazy.
*  And a fucking elite boxer. I mean, he hit him on the forehead.
*  And Ortiz's just his legs went out and you see him going, what the fuck just happened? Forehead. Who punches that hard?
*  Deontay's just got crazy, crazy power. But fact remains, he did it after a year and a half and he won a bronze medal in the Olympics, which is just spectacular.
*  Yeah, it's nuts, man. So that's where the original goal came from.
*  But I just saw like it was it just wasn't realistic for me at that time.
*  Like, especially at my weight class, like these dudes have been doing this since they were four years old.
*  There's a different speed. I've been and I was sparring with a lot of these guys.
*  I'm like, damn, man, this is like it's nuts, man.
*  It's nuts when you're at the lower weight because now you're dealing with not just in heavyweight.
*  You can somewhat get away with it because if you might be fashion, more athletic, right?
*  But at the lower weight classes, man, there is speed.
*  You got the you got you got the dudes from from Philadelphia, from California, like all these Mexicans, Blacks, whites that are just like, hey, man, they've been doing it forever.
*  This is a different sport, man. And I've been humbled before.
*  I feel like boxing in particular is one of those sports. It's very difficult to learn properly as you get older.
*  There's something about muscle memory and your body being ingrained, like developed to move a certain way and to strike a certain way and to be able to react on openings.
*  Like instinctually, it's almost like once you hit like 25, 26 years old and you start then like, oh, it's real hard to ever get to an elite level.
*  Yeah, your body starts to change and that happened to me.
*  And it's crazy. And it's ironic, Joe. It's like even my USC debut.
*  Like, think about this. Like I didn't make weight and I'll never forget it.
*  I was with my brothers actually back here to my with my brother Alonzo.
*  And I remember, you know, he I didn't make weight. I couldn't make the weight, man. I was just doing too much.
*  You're talking about by the time you get 25, like you hit the nail on the head because that's when I first started struggling to make weight.
*  And I didn't make weight at that time. And I remember I was just going to get on a flight and just disappear and never frequency and never look back.
*  Then I just retired. Yeah, this is crazy, Joe. This is crazy.
*  And my brother, my brother was, you know, thank God for him. My brother Alonzo.
*  And he's like, you need to be a man and you got to go and talk to Sean Shelby and tell him thank you and let him know that you're retired.
*  And I was mad. It took everything in my heart because I was so embarrassed, Joe.
*  This was this is when TJ fought when he was supposed to fight Burrell, I think the second time.
*  And and this is when he fought Joe Soto. So I was on that I was supposed to be on that card.
*  I was supposed to fight Scott Jorgensen. And I went down there, didn't make the weight and I'll never forget.
*  I was dehydrated. I was I couldn't even have tears to cry. I'm also dehydrated.
*  And I went up to to Sean Shams like, Sean, thank you, man. But I'm just I no longer want to do this sport, man.
*  Did you back out of that fight? I my body just wasn't reacting like I wasn't doing well.
*  Like my lip, I remember cutting cutting way. It's probably one of my worst way cuts ever.
*  I had a cold lip like I started vomiting like all the flu that I had in my body. Just stupid.
*  I was doing 16 pounds, Joe. I was doing 16 pounds like the day of the day of pretty much the day of weigh ins.
*  Wow. Like something stupid. And the only reason why I was doing something like that was because I felt when you come from the sport of wrestling,
*  like to me, making weight and doing everything that the MMA fighters were doing.
*  I was like, man, these dudes are spoiled. These dudes get 24. These dudes get close to about 30 hours before they fight.
*  I says, man, that's that's a lot of recovery time. So this is this is this is all stupid.
*  This is the way I saw it. And again, the age caught up to me. I would do the six. I would do the 16 pounds.
*  I would murder myself, really hurt myself, make the way and then balloon back up.
*  But there's came there came a point by the time I turned 25, 26, that my body just started to shut down on me.
*  And I just wasn't doing it right. And that finally kicked me in the ass.
*  So imagine that UFC debut. And I told Sean Chauvet that I'm done. I never fight it again.
*  But let me ask you this. So was your thought process that because of the fact that these MMA guys get more time to recover,
*  it's not like they have to weigh in the day of the wrestling match. They're they're weighing in the day before the fight in the daytime.
*  They don't have to fight. And then eventually we came in the morning. Yeah. Right.
*  So you have even more time. And then they didn't have to fight until the next day at night.
*  So you were like, I'm going to be heavier. I want to come in bigger with a bigger advantage. Yeah.
*  The idea. Yeah, I think so. And now looking looking at it now, it's just it's it's dumb, dude.
*  That's like you're it's better to feel good than to feel bigger. Being bigger is Marlon was bigger than me.
*  Yeah. You know, a lot of these dudes are bigger than me, but it didn't. Dominic was bigger than Dominic, too.
*  Even TJ, even TJ, when we did make flyweights, somehow he built I was 146.
*  So imagine that I made one hundred twenty five pounds, one hundred twenty four pounds.
*  TJ made the weight, right? Did he make the way he made the weight? He was he was 24 to I ballooned up to one hundred forty six pounds.
*  TJ ballooned up to one hundred and fifty pounds.
*  Dude, he looked worse cutting weight. He looked worse showing up for the wins than I've ever seen anybody since Travis Luthor.
*  When Travis Luthor missed weight against Anderson Silva, Travis Luthor missed weight against Anderson Silva.
*  I'll never forget this because I saw him when he missed the weight. Then I saw him.
*  I was backstage while he was trying to continue to cut because they gave him time to make weight and he couldn't lift his legs up to walk to the scale.
*  He was shuffling, like shuffling towards the scale. His lips were all cracked. Yeah, they're all sucked in. His face was sucked in.
*  He was he was literally on death's door. Like you could see it. He was on he was dying.
*  If that guy was like released from a prison, like an overseas prison, I'm like, oh my God, they were torturing him there.
*  He's he's about to die. I've never seen a guy look so bad. He looked so fucking bad.
*  And people forgot about Travis Luthor. Travis Luthor was a beast, man.
*  He was he had some of the best jujitsu that anybody had ever seen in the octagon up to that point.
*  Everybody he fought he submitted. He was so fucking good.
*  But he for whatever reason, when he had that big fight with Anderson Silva, he just couldn't keep it together.
*  And I believe he had Anderson Silva down at one point in time in that fight, too.
*  Then Anderson Silva caught him in a triangle and elbowed him off of his back.
*  And that's how I believe that's how the fight got stopped.
*  But Travis was the worst I've ever seen, like for someone just about to make weight, someone struggling to make weight.
*  Yeah. But even you think about guys like that, guys that have that have could have potentially become a world champion.
*  You know what I mean? So what happens when somebody loses?
*  What are the stages, the emotions when somebody loses?
*  You know what I'm saying? It's like there's a recovery process off of when people lose.
*  And, you know, I hate to say this, but I'll bring up I'll bring up Marlon Marais again, you know, because I feel like I gave the blueprint.
*  If you watch me fight him, then you watch Aldo fight him.
*  It's these guys, when they lose, they go through a certain psychology thing and you can see him as a fighter.
*  Every time I do fight, I always look at the demeanor.
*  I've always I always pay attention to their demeanor from the first round to the second round to the third as far as it goes.
*  And I've noticed that Marlon's demeanor was changing.
*  I noticed that in my fights when people's demeanor changes like that's to me, that's that's a breaking point that the mind has.
*  So I was able to see that with Marlon.
*  Then after that, what did you see? You saw that he was slowing down.
*  I saw he was I saw he was slowing down. His your his face starts to slouch.
*  His shoulders start to drop.
*  And then and then that's when I you really can't see in the middle.
*  But that's when I started talking to him. I'm like, all right, man, you ready? Let's go.
*  Bring it. Give it to me.
*  You know, this is during the fight. So you're talking back.
*  No, he wasn't. He wasn't.
*  And that's another reason is because they're so tired, man, that they don't they just don't have any energy.
*  Even McGregor, people like that.
*  But what I'm trying to get to is guys that lose if you don't recover from your defeat, from your loss, if you don't get therapy,
*  if you don't understand the reasons why you lost, man, you're screwed.
*  Therapy therapy. Have you gotten that?
*  Yeah, yeah. Like there.
*  But but it's more for me was more like a real realization when the first time I lost to Demetrius Johnson and getting knocked out in two minutes and 36 seconds.
*  It's like to me, the worst thing that could happen to a fighter and the worst scenario that something can happen to somebody and get stopped is getting knee to the body.
*  You're conscious, Joe, you're conscious and this is kneeing you from left to right.
*  And then your eyes are open and you've had enough.
*  And then you see Big John McCarthy waving his hands and you're knowing that he's making the right call.
*  But you're still conscious. You still want to go.
*  But you can't write your body shut off in front of twenty thousand people.
*  You know, with Joe Rogan commentating, I mean, it's it's miserable and it's terrible.
*  But it's a certain therapy.
*  It's a certain acceptance that you got to go through in order for you to come out of that.
*  So what did you do afterwards?
*  I let go of coaches, man, let go of coaches.
*  I started traveling the world. I mean, I went to Asia.
*  I went to what you do in Asia. I went out to Singapore.
*  I want to evolve. I spent about a month out there.
*  Oh, yeah. Just to train, just to train, just to go find like the best minds of mixed martial arts and just the basis to I went out to, you know,
*  to Holland for a month. I would go out to Brazil and just what you do in Holland and Holland.
*  I trained out with I trained with Paul Amoth. He's he's he's Andy Sowers coach.
*  Yes. I was with them and just training with them and just just humbling yourself.
*  I guess I guess I guess I could say.
*  And obviously throughout this whole time, it's like, man, I was on a quest because I still had Demetrius Johnson.
*  Like, I wasn't going to retire from the sport without without me giving him a fair shake.
*  So I knew that it had something to do not just with the body, but what the mind is almost like you got to come out of this, man.
*  Like you like it was almost like you can call it a mistake or whatnot.
*  But the reality is, is you lost, man. There's holes in your games.
*  So I always tell people, like, don't face it. I'm sorry. Don't fake it till you make it.
*  I don't like that you have to face this shit.
*  Once you face it, this is when you start to create, man, freaking overflowing success.
*  Did you know when you fought him and first of all, you fought the best version of Demetrius Johnson ever.
*  The guy to this day, I think, is the best example of a mixed martial artist I've ever seen.
*  Oh, yeah. I think Demetrius in his prime, he was so fucking good, man.
*  He was so fast and he was so technical and he made such good decisions.
*  His footwork, his movement, like everything was so precise.
*  Did you, did you say, OK, I see the gap, I see these holes and I know where he hit me.
*  I know where there was mistakes made. I got to tighten those up.
*  How do I do that? Yeah. Demetrius was so good everywhere, even in the wrestling.
*  I can even tell you as an Olympic athlete, even in the wrestling, his timing was really good.
*  So I don't even think it was so much Demetrius Johnson.
*  Obviously, it was a distance game, but it comes down to such, when you fight a guy like that, it comes down to such the minor details, man.
*  And I think the minor detail for me was composure.
*  And I remember right before I fought the dude, I noticed that my corner, my team, that they were extremely nervous, Joe.
*  Like my team, dude, you imagine fighting somebody like Demetrius Johnson and your coach is not having faith in you.
*  And I'm like, what the fuck? I'm like, shit, man, are you kidding me?
*  Well, he was a ghost back then. Demetrius was a ghost.
*  I mean, he wasn't there for you. He would be swinging at air.
*  He was just off to the side. Then he was kneeing you in the body and punching you in the face and kicking your leg on the way out.
*  And we should even say in the second fight, the fight that you won, he got you with that low calf kick and your leg went numb.
*  Yeah, I hit the peroneal nerve, which numbs like all the nerves to your feet.
*  So it sleeps it. And then when you try to lay your foot down, like if your foot's still awake, so I even sprayed it in the first round.
*  But this is the mind part that I had, Joe. It was a survival run, as you say.
*  I went back to the corner and I thought to myself, this is how crazy I'm.
*  I was like, hey, I just thought to myself, man, how crazy is this going to be when I beat this dude?
*  Like I survived that first run. I said, man, this is going to make my story.
*  Whatever I desired in my life that much better because I went through adversity with this fucking dude again.
*  Yeah, but just to get back to you. Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
*  That's a champion's mind. And even before.
*  So I'm getting ready to walk out. I'm getting ready to fight Demetrius Johnson.
*  And I noticed my team like they're still kind of like, you know, grabbing their fingers.
*  You know, I'm pacing back and forth and about a few hours before we went out to the arena.
*  I talked to my team and I sat him here and I've been like, and I sat my whole team down.
*  It's just like almost like a dad. And I'm like, listen, man, I says, I need you guys to trust me and have faith in me.
*  The key plan to be in this, like I know this is the greatest of all time, but I know what I've done in wrestling.
*  I can replicate that what I've done in mixed martial arts.
*  The only thing I'm going to ask from you guys is for you guys to be composed, for you guys to be composed.
*  Don't don't over yell. Stay calm. Like whatever happens in the fight, man, I just need you guys to bear with me and have faith in me because I'm going to.
*  You had to coach your coaches. Yeah, in some way, man. And it's crazy to say that.
*  So then right when I'm getting ready, check this out, just right when I'm getting ready to walk out, you know, right before I walk out first, I was gonna walk out and then Demetrius.
*  And I still notice my coach was still a little nervous and I looked at him. I says, Hey, guys, remember composure, man, composure.
*  Like I was so ready for this, dude. So then I go in there. I get kicked in the first 30 seconds, dude. My leg starts to wobble and so forth.
*  You know, it was a survival round. I allow him to win whatever I think he won. I think he won the first. I won the second. He won the third.
*  And then and then I believe I won the fourth and I won the fifth.
*  And then after this whole thing, check this out, Joe. He Demetrius Johnson was on Ariel Hoani and then Ariel Hoani asked him, Hey, Demetrius, just one last question.
*  He was like, What's one thing that surprised you about Henry and Demetrius Johnson said, Well, I knew he was going to be fast.
*  I knew he was strong. But there's one thing that really did surprise me with Henry. It was the fact that he was so relaxed.
*  You know, so it's these tactical things and everybody that you fight is completely different.
*  You know, you can have a certain word that you can put up here. But I knew that being composed and relaxed and not overreacting to Demetrius Johnson, that that would win me the fight for this fight.
*  There's a lot more to it. It was me being knowing when to fight and knowing when to compete.
*  It's me being a little theatrical, like bumping my face, like conveying the judges, those little things that you learn as a veteran of competition that you can even convey the judges.
*  So there's even acting going on, Joe. Now, I'm telling you guys all my secrets here. But in reality, there is, man. That's I'm just a winner.
*  I just the only thing I just know how to do is know how to win.
*  How are you going to step away from this? Come on, Henry.
*  How are you going to do this?
*  Show me the money!
*  I'm torn. Like I said in the beginning, man, I feel both ways. And one, I'm happy when a fighter gets out on top of the game like you.
*  Like one of my favorite boxing stories of all time is Marvin Hagler. You know why? Because he fought Sugar Ray Leonard. I think he got robbed to this day.
*  I think he won the decision. They gave it to Sugar Ray and then he backed away. That's sage.
*  What you got here? You smoking this job?
*  Bro, no, you light it up to kill the demons in the room. This Native American lady gave me this. She came in to talk to us about I got in this long kick of reading about Native American history.
*  They actually a lot of them referred themselves as American Indians.
*  But and then this lady came in and educated me on a lot of issues and brought me some sage to clear all the bad spirits.
*  Yeah, no, I believe in a lot of these rituals. Actually not too long ago I was actually with Uncle Mike.
*  Yeah, you told me that.
*  With Mike Tyson and...
*  I'm just getting rid of demons right now, bro.
*  Demons be gone.
*  Don't start shaking back there, man.
*  No, we'll be alright. Jamie's no demon.
*  You never know.
*  Yeah, but I was able to, because as you know, Mike has always talked about the toad.
*  Yes.
*  You've done the toad too.
*  Yeah, what the toad is, what you're referring to is five methoxydimethyltryptamine that's excreted by the toad's skin.
*  They take this type of toad, I forget the name of the toad, but they get it excited and excrete this stuff from its skin onto glass.
*  And then they leave that glass out in the sun and it dries, that excretion dries, and then you scrape it up with a razor blade and then you smoke that stuff.
*  Or you could just get a synthetic version of it.
*  Colorado River Toad, that's what it is.
*  Sonoran Desert Toad.
*  Yeah, Sonoran.
*  And you can find the center of the universe through the excretions of this toad's body.
*  Oh my god, it's a trip, Joe. It's a trip.
*  Have you done anything before this? Before you did this, have you had any experiences with psychedelics?
*  Yeah, I've done mushrooms and obviously high smoke, which I don't know where all the Mary Jane is.
*  It's right here, bro. You want some? Come on, you're retired.
*  Yeah, why not, man?
*  Come on, Jeff Novitski, leave me alone.
*  Novitski actually wanted everybody to be able to. He's one of the first guys to say it's nonsense. It's not a performance enhancer.
*  Although with Nick Diaz, I think it might be.
*  Yeah.
*  I think with Nick Diaz, it might actually be a performance enhancer.
*  I really think so, man. When he fought Gomi, they said he had to have gotten high.
*  He had so much weed in his system when they tested him that he had to have gotten high right before the fight.
*  Yeah. Light that up, Joe. You puff, puff, pass?
*  Of course.
*  So I'm going to share my story with you, Joe, and I want you to share yours with me.
*  Okay.
*  What type of leaf is this?
*  Well, that's tobacco on the outside, so it's a blunt. And then the inside, it's the weed.
*  I get this from Speedweed. Shout out to my man, Gino.
*  Gino Gentile.
*  Anyway, so check this out. You imagine doing the toe with somebody like Mike?
*  I got high with Mike and I got nervous. Well, I'm nervous when I meet him. He was one of my heroes.
*  When I was a kid, Mike Tyson was the fucking man.
*  I mean, in a way that it's hard for people to convey today to understand what a cultural figure Mike Tyson was in like 1986.
*  It's hard to convey. You're not going to, no one's going to understand. Youngest ever heavyweight champion.
*  You know, knocks out Trevor Burbank when he's 20 years old.
*  He was the same guy that beat Ali, right?
*  Trevor Burbank beat Ali late in his career when it was real sad. It was a real sad fight. It was a real sad fight.
*  But it's touching. Remember when Ali went in the ring and gave Mike like a little pep talk.
*  And then Mike went out there and knocked that dude out in the first round.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Muhammad Ali's like, fuck this dude up for me, will you?
*  Yeah. Yeah. But anyways, to get back to that, Gino, so I've actually been shadowing Mike Tyson for the last,
*  I'm good friends with his manager Rob, Rob Hickman. And just the stuff that they're doing at Tyson Ranch, man, is pretty cool.
*  Yeah, it's really cool, right?
*  Yeah, they're bringing medicine to the world. So Mike, I've been on his podcast. He's always talked about the toad.
*  I was like, all right. You know, so I became good friends with, I call him Uncle Mike, man, because he's just, you know, he scolds me a lot.
*  Every time he sees me, he's always, you know, he'll compliment me, but then he'll scold me at the same time.
*  So he always talked about the toad. I'm just like, well, let's do it then, Mike. Let's do it, Uncle Mike.
*  So he's like, man, dude, you sure you want? I'm like, yeah, man, you've been talking about it for a minute.
*  So, you know, so we go out, we go on this, you know, they have this whole real nice set up with rituals or whatnot.
*  And we go out to Antigua, which is an island off the Caribbean. We have, I forget what they're called, the person that-
*  Shaman?
*  Yeah, shaman, I'm sorry. And he's out there and, you know, Mike goes first. So Mike, imagine this, Mike Tyson does it.
*  You know, Mike Tyson, Mike Tyson, he's doing it. He's going a bit crazy, man, because a lot of what that does is it brings out a lot of your, as you say, you know, you open up the stage, a lot of your demons.
*  A lot of things that you've probably been holding on to for a minute. So I'm seeing Mike over here twist and turning and kind of, you know, talk about a lot of, I don't want to share that stuff, but, you know, talk about a lot of his past.
*  And that's me, as you said, he's an idol, he's a legend. You know, that's the way I look at Mike too. I'm over here, you know, I'm just, I'm almost like tripping out, but at the same time intrigued, you know, because-
*  So then I go up and I do it. And man, it took me to, especially out of retirement here, man, like I would, I almost kind of somewhat wanted answers. I was hoping that it would give me, okay, man, this is like the path or whatnot.
*  And it took me to like, it took me to my mom's like, your mom's like first love, man. You know, and it showed me like in a story, almost like in a movie, you know, how I was born, how my mom had me, how by the time I was eight years old, like I had my sister, so I was no longer the youngest, how my mom kind of like, you know, in all fairness, kind of somewhat pushed to the side.
*  Leaving home at the age of 17 and substituting my mom's love for self-fulfillment, wrestling, mixed martial arts. And it brought me back to a little kid when I was maybe four or five when I would cry to my mom, because I remember as a kid we would go from LA to New Mexico like in Greyhounds.
*  And I remember stopping at McDonald's and things like that. But to me, you know, as a kid, you don't know you're poor. But what that did is that brought me back to the person that created me, that brought me back to my mom's love, man. So it like, it like resurrected something in me. And I was crying, I was asking for like forgiveness. I was speaking in Spanish.
*  And my mom, she was like, mom, forgive me. It was something scary in some ways because it takes you out of your body. It's almost like you're in judgment day and you're the one that's being convicted and you're the judge too. And it's telling you but it's giving you this certain peace. It's like you're so dead that you're alive.
*  It's a trip, Joe. I don't know which ones you had, but this is what I can share, what I can experience. It was cool, man, because I was able to do it with special people. I did it with Kelvin. We all did it. It was already formally planned. And then my brother back there, my mentor probably pissed at me because they look out for me a lot.
*  And man, it was something that, you know, as an adult, you know, you have the rights to make these decisions and share if it's good. And I felt like the Toad was probably one of the best things that's happened to me, like honestly, because it makes you realize and reflect on what truly matters.
*  I think there's a fear of it just because it's illegal. I really think that's it. And it should be respected. It's very dangerous in that sense that it could not it not that it could do harm to you physically. If it's the real deal, it's not going to do harm to you physically. Your body has it in it. Your body knows what to do with it. It's one of the reasons why it's such a quick trip. Your body knows how to bring that stuff back to baseline very quickly. That's why it's only like a 15 minute trip. Yeah.
*  But it's not it's not bad for you all the time. I think it's like many it's a really powerful thing that it's got to be respected. It could fuck you up if you're not ready. If you have some distorted versions of the world that you're operating under. For me, one of the things that made me feel like right away, one of the first things was realizing how much of like the way I talk about things is like calculated.
*  I was like, I was trying to figure out like I would say things in a way that I wanted people to say, oh, he phrased that cool. Like I would try hard to impress people with the way I was saying things. And I was realizing that as I was trying to describe the trip after it was over, I was like, that's interesting.
*  So that probably leads to a disconnect between me and someone who's listening because it's not 100% what's going on in my head. It's at least a little bit showmanship and bullshit. And it made me realize that in that moment, like I think it probably made me a better everything probably be better comedian, probably maybe better podcast.
*  It's been a minute. When did you do this for the first time?
*  The first time I did it was early 2000s. So I guess we're looking at like 2002 ish somewhere around then. Yeah, that was like the first time I did it. Last time I did it was about two years ago. But the last time I did it, I did the other kind that n n dimethyl triptamine actually maybe a little less than two years ago, little less than two years ago. It was n n dimethyl tryptamine, which is that's the different version. That's the version of it that's in Iowa.
*  That's the version of it. There's a bunch of different snuffs and different ways that people try to to get that stuff into their system. But smoking it is the quickest smoking it gets you free, you vaporize it, and it gets you right to the center of the universe immediately. And all those things.
*  You know, I think man, one of the cool things about life, like what you're talking about in your journey, your journey as a as a man, your journey as a champion, your journey to become better and to show what you're capable of.
*  This all of this is because no one gets it right. You don't just get it right. Like you fuck it up, and you try to do better and you you fail and then you figure out what went wrong. And you you just constantly analyze whatever you're doing and obsess on it and you can become better at that thing.
*  And through that, you can understand that you could be better at anything. And I think when you any kind of psychedelic, where you have an opportunity to look at yourself, just really look at yourself accurately. You're not going to like it. But it's going to give you great benefit because it's going to give you you're going to be able to see yourself honestly, and see whatever those flaws does.
*  Don't get mad that you have all these flaws. Just fix them. Just fix them. Do your best to fix them. And you're not going to get it right. Because ego is still going to come creeping back in your life. And ego is still going to hold on to your legs and drag you down while you're trying to run.
*  You know, so it is egos like hanging on your ankles, where you're trying to run like come on, stay the same. But you can't stay the same and get better. The way you get better is to relax and to to realize that you know all all your fuck ups, all the fails all that. That's not you just because you lost a match doesn't mean you're a loser.
*  You just lost like you should be happy that you got this opportunity to feel terrible. Because through that opportunity to feel terrible. That's where all the growth comes from. If you can survive it. Some people can't survive it right you all know. We all know those guys that were really good in the gym and they had like one or two matches or one or two fights and they just couldn't handle the pressure for whatever reason they couldn't handle the things that went wrong. And they just didn't want to do it anymore. But they could have been like a world beater. You know you everyone knows that guy.
*  Yeah, right. And what is wrong with that guy? Well, that guy's got one aspect of your two part thing that you were talking about. Heart and ability, right? He's got one aspect. He's got the ability. But this is he's got a missing part. And he doesn't want to look at it. Because if he wanted to look at it, he would concentrate entirely on that. And he would get better at that. But it's hard. Yeah, it's hard to look at yourself. psychedelics let you look at yourself like hey, stupid. Look at you. Remember the last time I did DMT? I did DMT. I did DMT. I did DMT. I did DMT. I did DMT. I did DMT. I did DMT. I did DMT. I did DMT. I did DMT. I did DMT. I did DMT. I did DMT. I did DMT. I did DMT. I did DMT. I did DMT. I did DM
*  There was a string of jokers like jesters with the bells on dancing in front of me going like this. Fuck you. Just openly mocking me. I was like, oh, that must be what I need. I must need that. Mike, that's good. That's good to see. Yeah, it's that it's definitely a step in ego check man big time dissolves it man like like with Mike like he loves a dude and yeah, he's you know, he owes it to the to the total you know what I'm saying? Like that said that he
*  said that's been a big reason why he's changed his life. You know, Mike wasn't doing so well until until he tried this and he you know, he talks about all the time on his podcast. So it gives you an opportunity to shift. It's it's hailed drug addicts. I mean, drug addicts have gone from doing all kinds of crazy. Well, they tried to tow and they completely just left everything guys that they left like almost like a dead man walking to a he's alive again. He's here with us. Yeah, I think a lot of diseases of addiction are diseases of despair.
*  Right? It's like disease of the mind and wanting to squash those demons and drown them out the anxiety, the fear, the depression, the you know, just the terrible feelings you have about who you are, you know, maybe you're homeless. Maybe your your life's falling apart, but you're alive right now and you can't handle it. You can't handle where you're at. You can't handle who you are. You can't handle what people have done to you. So you just throw drugs in there, throw drugs in there and something like
*  DMT or you know, there's a bunch of different sort of psychedelics that can do it for a lot of people. It's Ibogaine Ibogaine is a big one for drug addicts. People have real issues with opiates. Ibogaine knocks it out of the park with those people. It's get cures a giant number. See what is that? See if you can Google the percentage of people who are cured of addictions by Ibogaine.
*  Ibogaine is it comes from the I've never done this with all due respect in full disclosure. It's it was it's from the bogatry. I believe it's from Africa and there's something about this drug that just kills all ideas that you have of addiction and rewires your brain and it's insanely effective and but ruthless. It's like a 24 hour experience.
*  Oh my god. Look at this one doctor reported 70 to 80% success rate with effective aftercare. He added that when people recovering from meth addiction took Ibogaine but returned to the same environment where they'd originally abused meth. There was a 90% relapse rate. That's not good.
*  So that's terrible. So you have to do it and then get out or maybe it's meth. Maybe meth just like super hard to kick. What's the hardest one to kick? I've never fucked with. There's no any problem. I were talking about this once. We were both saying this like there's no meth advocates like people are telling you you should take weed like bro weed will calm you down. We will make you more friendly. There's weed evangelists. There's no like meth guys. You know what I'm saying?
*  That's funny. And Ozark that comes up at the end. She's like I want to start those treatment centers. Yes. Yes. Don't same time. Don't spoil alert. I forgot. Yeah. You did a good job. Yeah. That didn't give away too much enough. God damn. It's there's something about having any sort of a psychedelic experience. It just makes you realize how badly you're fucking up. And for some people that's enough. Like the whole reason why they would do a psychedelic if they were addicted also is because they realize they were fucking up and they're looking for some way to change.
*  You know those good feelings that you have man like when when you beat dominant crews and you raise your hands at the end of that fight and you knew it was going to be over. You knew it was going to be over. You knew you're you're going to go down in history no matter what. Even if you step away right now. I know you say the greatest but I'm just in the fairness of experts in combat. You are one of the greatest of all time for sure. Olympic gold medalist two division world champion. That's that's unheard of. And
*  you're doing it all in this super technical division. Both of them 25 and 35 super technical divisions. Everybody's a wizard. And then we saw that this weekend man. Holy shit. What a weekend for the bantamweight division right. Yeah it's exciting man. There's a lot of there's a lot of good people out there. The resurrection to of Cody. Dude Cody looks so good. He didn't just look so good. He looked so fucking fast. So fast and technical. I mean it was super impressive. But so
*  was Al Jameen Sterling. Yeah Al Jameen choking out San Hagen like that and being able to do it in under two minutes. That's crazy. Yeah that is. And that's crazy. And especially the guy who he be and how he beat San Hagen. He's a beast. He's the real deal. That was the fight that I was thinking on the card was going to be the most difficult to call. Yeah. I was like who's going to win that one. I don't know because they're both so good. And San Hagen is surging. But Al Jameen
*  just shut it all down man. The way he did it. Just so intense. Right. Like he hits a new level. You know. You know sometimes a fighter will just hit a new level. Now when you think about him it's probably hard for you because that's that's your division. Yeah. But I again his wrestling. I break people down like even through their mentality. I study the fighters I'm going to study. I study their mental game too and how they do interviews. And I'll give you two examples. And I feel like I feel like Al Jameen
*  Sterling is almost the same thing as as Demetrius Johnson just in the concept of my wrestling just because of my wrestling I feel extremely confident with my hands. And I know he can't take me down. I know he won't take me down. So I know there's a game pack set in place where I can be a little more offensive with somebody like Al Jameen Sterling. And I'll see let's talk to let's talk about Sean O'Malley. I'm just I just want to break this down real quick. Even somebody like him. Listen to his interviews.
*  And you study these guys and you see where their mindset is and where their holes are going to be. It's like they had asked them who do you want to ask Sean O'Malley who do you want to fight next. And he's like you know I just want to fight you know I just want to fight the best strikers. He never mentioned about I'll take anybody out. I'll take anybody in the top 10 or 15 or whatever because in my opinion he hasn't really beat somebody that's like OK man you're the real deal. Even though he did be Wyland and he was a contender but it's been a long time. And I hear a young kid that's learning the sport.
*  And that's how we're watching him on the UFC. That's what's crazy about him. I mean you want you go back to Dana White's contender show and he was looser wilder you know fun to watch but not nearly as sharp. Now he's on a completely different level.
*  I mean he's not whining like that. Faking the uppercut and then just following over the top with a straight right hand and catching him slipping. I mean that was fantastic.
*  But that's the point that I'm trying to get to is it's a striking game for him right now. You know what I'm saying. There is a whole other aspect and that's called wrestling and jiu jitsu. And that's one I've heard. He has developed pretty good jiu jitsu but there's that other art that I want to see when you really get tested and you're taking it to deep waters.
*  Then I'll see your real colors. Then I'll be like okay man you are ready to take on anybody in the top five. I'm going to give you a good example of that. Yair Rodriguez when he fought Frankie Edgar. That was a good example of that. Frankie Edgar was just that wrestling was too strong.
*  That ground and pound was too strong. He couldn't keep him off him. He just couldn't do anything about it. And that was a great example that because Yair was this super flash kicker. I mean Yair to me has some of the best kicks I've ever seen inside the octagon. Wild flashy shit.
*  Remember when he threw that. He threw against BJ. He hit him with a 360 roundhouse kick to the face. Do you remember that? That's some crazy shit to pull off in a fight. 360 roundhouse kicked him in the face.
*  Yair was a beast and everybody was really thinking he's on a short path to the title. But the big hole was that wrestling. It was exposed by how elite Frankie is and how nasty Frankie's ground and pound is. It was a major beat down.
*  That's one of those fights where you watch a guy and you go this guy it's all about styles. Because it's all about if he found someone that played his game. Like oh shit he's good at that game. But what Frankie did is just completely impose his game. Just drag him down and beat him up.
*  And then we don't know what would happen with O'Malley when it comes to that. But I know who he is as a person and he's working. He's working on everything. That kid is focused as fuck. He keeps getting better and better and better. Like in a trippy way.
*  Like when you saw him come back after two years off. You know two years dealing with a bunch of bullshit. I forget what he was suspended for. I don't remember what it was. Was it marijuana? That doesn't make sense. Tainted supplements?
*  Yeah. Anyway. I'm interested.
*  Yeah. And it's making the Bannerwood division with guys like that. It's making it exciting.
*  Oh it's so exciting. First of all we didn't even talk about it. You got Piotr Jan versus Jose Aldo for your title. Does it still feel like yours?
*  I let it go Joe. I let it go. Honestly. Honestly I let it go. They can all kill each other. That's how I feel. I'm so happy. I'm so satisfied Joe. Honestly.
*  You look happy. The point is what a division.
*  Unless you cross me with something here. I don't know what you...
*  No. It's all good bro. It's all good. I'm really excited about that Jose Aldo Piotr Jan fight. But it's fascinating to me that they decided to give the fight to Aldo even though Marais won the decision.
*  It's a real interesting choice isn't it? Because although I agree with the decision. I think...or excuse me. I agree with Aldo. I think Aldo won that fight. I think it was a really close fight but I thought Aldo won the fight.
*  But it was close. It was really close. But the fact that the judges gave it to Marlin and then the UFC is like nah player. We're going to have Aldo fight Piotr.
*  And part of it is because Aldo is obviously a huge draw and one of the greatest of all time. Particularly the greatest featherweights of all time.
*  Well remember I'm actually going to change your mind on that. It's actually really my fault.
*  It's your fault?
*  Yeah it's my fault that Jose Aldo is fighting for the belt. Because that's who I was originally supposed to fight with Dominic. But this whole COVID thing happened. So Aldo was going to fight for the title and then it's like you can't do that to him. So the UFC you know they stuck to their word.
*  Oh that's interesting. Still though if Aldo was Marlin.
*  At least I think. If Eddie was here we could debate man.
*  That makes sense. That 100% makes sense. That makes sense. Listen I'm happy for both fights. I'd be happy if Marlin fought Piotr Jahn for the title. Or I'd be happy if Aldo fought him. I'd be happy if Marlin and Aldo fought again. There's great fights in that division. Now that you've stepped down.
*  Really the people that I think that should fight for the belt would be Al Jermaine Sterling and Piotr. Or I'm going to call him Peter. I ain't going to get that authentically.
*  It was Peter for a while. We were supposed to call him Peter. And then they said no it's Piotr. Piotr. It's like Phaidor. You know Phaidor's real name is not Phaidor. It's Fyodor. That's so rude. We could have said Fyodor.
*  Yeah but even somebody like Peter Jahn. How dangerous is he? Yeah he beat Uriah but Uriah's been out for a minute. Besides Uriah what's another big name that that dude has beaten?
*  No well clearly he's very good. There's no doubt about it. Whether or not he's at your level you don't find out until he fights a guy like you. Or he fights a guy like Aldo. That's when we find out what's up. But we know he's really good.
*  The way he beat up Uriah. It's not just that he beat him. He beat him up. And Uriah's always going to be a tough out. He's a tough guy man. He's a super skilled, super seasoned guy. Uriah's been around forever. He's fought so many good guys. He knows how to survive.
*  And to see Phaidor beat him up like that. It's like wow. And he's fucking strong man. He's fucking strong. Like he's got that weirdo Russian strength. He is dangerous. He's got power. He throws knees. He throws off the clinch.
*  Yep. Yep. Dangerous. He's technical. When I see a guy like that it's like he's technical and he has malice. And when someone's technical and they have malice it's like that's what I have. And I can recognize that.
*  Yeah. Malice is a good way of putting it. What Mike Tyson would call bad intentions. Yeah. Yeah. He's got it. So the division's never been more exciting. And there's still guys like Jimmy Rivera. Still a dangerous, dangerous fighter.
*  That's what I'm saying Joe. You think they'll miss me? They're going to miss you anyway man. Come on. They're going to miss you. They hated the cringe. No no no. Listen you did a great job with all that cringey shit. You made people pay attention. I thought it was genius.
*  Knowing you, who you really are, seeing this character that you're doing. Did I get you up? Yeah. Oh I was laughing hard man. Are you ready for me to become the intergender world champ?
*  When you're telling Valentina to bend the knee I was crying. I was crying. That is so funny. Can we put up some pictures of that? The intergender world champ. That is hilarious. What made you decide, just like look, I need something. I need something to market myself. No it was actually, no I wasn't even, oh my god this is kind of a, it's funny.
*  But it's somebody high profile that dared me to. I'm like dude I can't do that. He challenged me so much. He's like I dare you. I was like, ahhh. Alright. So I ended up doing the video and then I was like god dude what am I doing? Oh that's hilarious.
*  But looking at what had done Joe, I was like we saved, I saved, I saved an entire division man because Dane White wanted to cut his neck off and he told me that.
*  There's something about what you did that's like this is what Connor did, this is what, Chael Sonnen was probably the best at it, the original. Chael Sonnen is the original pro wrestling style shit talker in MMA that really made people hyped up about fights.
*  I mean you gotta give credit to Chael because before Chael, there was, you know, I'm gonna fuck him up, I'm gonna kick his ass. People always talk shit. But they never talk shit with an entertainer's flair the way Chael did.
*  I mean even though you kind of knew that Chael was in over his head in some of those fights like with John Jones, I had a real deep feeling he was in over his head with Anderson Silva in the second fight in particular.
*  You know I just had a feeling he was in over his head but he would still talk so much shit, it was so fun and it made the fights way bigger. They should all thank him. Thank you for what you said about my mother, thank you for all that crazy shit you said because that's what really sold that fight.
*  They all made more money because of him.
*  Yeah, they all, man, the thing is what I admire about that now, like a guy like Kobe, obviously Conor, even Ronda, I think Ronda was more of a persona, it was more the fact that the pressure that comes with that shit, like dude, that's like a whole nother fight and you have to make sure that you gotta live up to your expectations.
*  You remember me throwing shit out the bag with the pillow? What'd you think of the pillow stuff? I'm like dude, I really gotta beat Dominic's ass dude.
*  You know the pillows with the heads on them and you're kicking the pillows with different guys' heads but dude it was funny. It was funny. It does put extra pressure on you, right, because if you lose people are so happy.
*  But check this out, this is how crazy I am. That pressure, man, I channel that thing and I almost love it, Joe. It's crazy, like I like feeling a little scared.
*  The pillow, laying in bed with your belts and the pillows with TJ's head and DJ's head, it's hilarious.
*  The king of cringe, bend the knee.
*  So what did your friend, that you won't say the person's name, can you say what their name rhymes with?
*  Man, I can't, Joe, I can't.
*  Don't throw them, tell me later. But what did they say to you? Like I want you to come up with this character? Is that what they said to you?
*  No, I think it was after I beat Demetrius Johnson, I went to the Apex fight with, and I happened to be there randomly and obviously Dana was there at the fight and I pulled him aside and said, hey Dana, how are you?
*  He actually wanted to talk to me, so I came to my office and I ended up going from the fights to his office and I was in his red Ferrari, freaking really nice too.
*  And he said, hey bud, I just want to let you know that I'm thinking about getting rid of the division, or I'm going to get rid of the division.
*  This is what, right after I beat Demetrius Johnson, you know what I'm saying? Like there's new blood.
*  And he told me straight up and I was just like, man, I have to do something, man.
*  Like if I don't start speaking up, if I don't start being hated, like my division is going to drown, man, and it's up to me.
*  And I felt like that's something that Demetrius never did.
*  Can you tell you why?
*  It wasn't entertaining. It was people don't pay attention.
*  I think because Demetrius was so dominant, like they don't appreciate true art, man.
*  Demetrius was so dominant that he hurt a division because there's like, it gets boring.
*  There has to be a storyline, a storyline to people. And Demetrius wasn't the most personable dude in the world.
*  So then I took that upon myself when he said that, I was like, well, I'm going to have to come up with a gimmick.
*  You know, I was originally, originally I was supposed to go up to 135 pounds.
*  Right.
*  And I brought TJ down because if I was going to go up to 135 pounds, they were going to strip me from my belt.
*  It was like, this is the contract. And that was the original plans for me to go up.
*  But then I decided to come down and keep the division and kind of fight for it.
*  Let's talk about that fight because that was a crazy situation, right?
*  First of all, TJ looked like dead man walking, going to the weigh-in.
*  Like I said, as bad as anybody I've ever seen besides Travis Luthor.
*  I mean, Travis Luthor was a dehydration thing. TJ had starved himself down to a skeleton.
*  It was real weird. And then when you found out that he has taken EPO,
*  and then he said that he was taking EPO because he just didn't have any energy from cutting that weight.
*  I don't know, man. I don't know what the answer. My brother and I were talking about that yesterday.
*  I'm not sure what it was, but I'm just, I felt sick inside when I found out, Joe.
*  It's like a sadness that it brings to you because dude, it's like, yeah, we may talk stuff to each other,
*  but it doesn't get that personal.
*  It shouldn't get that personal for somebody to take an EPO, man.
*  Something that, a drug that you just will never get tired of.
*  And then fight that dude with these four ounce gloves. You know what I'm saying?
*  There's a little bit of malice there, man. So remember that day I called, I talked to my brother, I talked to my mom.
*  I was like, dude, as thick-skinned as we grew up and whatnot, this is hurting me, man.
*  What would you have done if you found out before the fight? If they gave you the option?
*  I felt so good.
*  If they pulled you aside and said, listen, Henry, the fight's going to go on, but we got an issue.
*  It turns out we just got TJ's drug sample back and he tested positive for EPO.
*  You can still fight him if you want to. We're going to strip him. We're going to, even if he wins,
*  we're going to strip him. We're going to fine him and keep him from fighting for two years.
*  He's going to get convicted of using this stuff, but you can choose to fight him. Just don't tell anybody.
*  Here's my deal, man.
*  If you're going to ask me a question like that, I got one for you too.
*  But a guy can, they can say, like a guy misses weight by five pounds, he can still fight you.
*  That's a fucking big advantage. He didn't have to cut those extra five.
*  You know how many times guys miss weight and still win? It's big. It's a big number.
*  When guys miss weight and wind up winning the fight, I believe, who was talking about that?
*  One of the commentators, it might have been Dominic Cruz.
*  He was talking about guys missing weight and then winding up winning the fight because they have an advantage.
*  They didn't cut the weight.
*  We all know there's a certain point in time where you shouldn't lose any more weight.
*  But we also know there's a dark land where most people don't want to travel through.
*  Where you can make it through, where you can get to that point where you don't want to do it anymore.
*  You're fucking dying inside, but you stay in there an extra 20 minutes and you make the weight.
*  Or some people don't. But the guy who doesn't, it's bad for your body to cut that much weight.
*  The guy who leaves those extra five pounds on his body, that's a big advantage. That's big.
*  It is, but also, it is actually.
*  What's bigger, that or EPO?
*  EPO, I imagine. T.J. was saying how good he felt. He never felt so good in his life. I'm just hearing it from him.
*  But also in that fight, that's when I felt the most prepared. I felt even until now, my career, I'm retired. I'm really done.
*  And that's the best that I've ever felt against T.J. De La Show.
*  So I think to answer that question, I think I still would fight him for that reason.
*  Because I did everything natural and I used science.
*  You had a really interesting team with you the last time you were here. Were they called NeuroForce?
*  Yeah, NeuroForce 1.
*  Without having people go back and listen to that podcast, give me this rundown of what they did in terms of your reaction times
*  and all that specific, sport specific, neuro shit they were doing with you.
*  Because it was real, I say neuro shit because I'm a moron. I don't know what the term is.
*  But it's fascinating listening to them talk about how they used real science and data to mark your performance.
*  Yeah, I think everything from the morning by the time I wake up, I have the Omega wave.
*  And a lot of the credit that I do O2 is out at the UFCPI with Roman, the physiologist down there.
*  And I wake up every morning, I use the Omega wave which gives me my heart rate ability.
*  It kind of gives me my windows open.
*  What's it called? Omega wave?
*  Yeah, Omega wave.
*  And this is a chest strap?
*  Yes, when you wake up, the first thing you do before you brush your teeth or anything is you put this strap on.
*  It's taking levels of your heart rate.
*  So it allows you to let you know, according to your heart rate, how hard you're able to train that day.
*  So it gives it into like, you got your windows of trainability, like how hard you should go.
*  And it kind of measures a lot of your training. So I do that every morning.
*  And then obviously I've done testing with them from balance, like just body scan, dex scan, like a bunch of things.
*  And crazy amounts of testing to kind of figure more out of like my biomechanics and things of that matter.
*  So I only have about three to four hard workouts like a week.
*  Like I don't do no more than maybe even three.
*  Really?
*  Because it's all according, because it's about you understanding your threshold.
*  And I think where a lot of fighters don't succeed is they exert that and then they want to fight that.
*  And then next you know if they're on the ground or they're losing.
*  So they're not optimizing their performance by giving themselves an ample amount of recovery.
*  They're training too hard too often.
*  And yes, and using a lot more recovery.
*  Like what I do down there is I do a lot of infrared lighting.
*  I do altitude pod capsules, the technology that they have.
*  Like there's certain headphones that helps you know activate like everything in your body.
*  Like it's the new age thing with a lot of like pressure machines and things of that matter.
*  A lot of like you doing a lot of mobility exercises.
*  Like it's crazy how powerful and how strong you become just through doing mobility, man, understanding posture.
*  So you know, big shout out to my strength coach Andre Hicks and Kevin Longoria, Kareem Amin and everybody down there.
*  Because they're revolutionizing, man.
*  I feel like I'm ahead on the curve when it comes to understand how to do a proper camp for MMA.
*  Where I'm not extremely killing myself.
*  I'm loving the sport through the process like it doesn't always have to be a crazy battle.
*  That's a big revelation for a lot of people.
*  They're hearing this from you and they're like, oh shit, that's crazy.
*  This might literally shift the way people train because so many guys are out there leaving it all in the gym.
*  They're so tough and they're trying to condition themselves.
*  But there's a there's a just like a tipping point where you're working too hard and you're always sore and your body doesn't have a chance to recover.
*  And you don't grow. You don't get better. You just sort of maintain.
*  And that's where a lot of guys wind up getting injured as well.
*  Yeah. And a lot of that stuff too.
*  It's like when I do my training, it's like I revolve all my training around my sparring.
*  Like my sparring is my most important thing.
*  So I almost number my workouts on how numbers that should be that day.
*  So I'm going to give you an example.
*  On Monday, it could be a it could be a seven and eight, two practices, right?
*  On Monday, the next day, they're going to be more of like a four and a five or five and a six.
*  It all depends on your on your match.
*  You know what I mean? On your you know, your performance and all the testing that they've done.
*  But on Wednesday, this is where I got to deliver.
*  And this is where I have to give the 10.
*  So this is a sparring day. Yes, it's a sparring day.
*  And there's only one sparring day a week.
*  There's two. So once technical and the other one is all right, man, this is we have the ref.
*  I got I got a doctor in there like literally, man, it's legit.
*  Like every time I spar, the music comes out. My opponent's music, my music.
*  I walk out. I get checked. Yeah. Really?
*  Yeah. It's it's done every time during capping on my my my coach, Captain Eric Albertson.
*  He's we've been able to simulate and emulate everything that we that we're going to do in a fight.
*  Like even my training, like my training is not me doing jiu jitsu for two hours.
*  And then I do boxing like, no, no, no, I'm in their place sparring, seeing where I'm doing good in place,
*  and then adjusting what I saw in place for with the coaches individually.
*  And then I'm giving 20 minutes to my to that.
*  And then I give 20 minutes to my striking with pad work or it could be with the partner.
*  But I'm going the whole time. You see what I'm saying?
*  So I'm collaborating everything together, simulating the fight as much as possible, being being very detailed in my training.
*  And then when it comes to sparring, that's that's the real deal.
*  That's where I have to shine. And that's how I show myself.
*  I'm good. I'm becoming. Are you using are you taking notes?
*  Like how are you keeping track of your progress? Are you just knowing in your head or you?
*  I know it and I feel it. But I also have like a communication with my coaches where they know that I'm extremely honest.
*  Man, I'm not feeling well. I'm not.
*  There's some some things I need to rest another two, three hours before I go train today, guys.
*  You know what I'm saying? It's a very selfish style training.
*  And that's a big advantage. Yeah, yeah.
*  It's it's I am giving a lot of knowledge here, man.
*  But this is you know, that's who I am. And I want to share what I have.
*  I've never heard anybody break it down that way, particularly the fact that I don't think I've ever heard.
*  I did. I forgot anybody doing that where you have your opponent's walkout music.
*  You have your walkout music. You have a referee. You do the whole thing like a fight.
*  I've never heard anybody do that. But that makes sense.
*  And particularly if you do it at the Apex Center where there's no crowd.
*  Yeah, it is like doing it in your gym.
*  And this is how we train for Dom. This last camp that I had was like the best.
*  This kept that I had with Dominic was like the best fight that the best fight come I've ever had.
*  Like the best because I've I learned from like everything that I've done.
*  And I've I it's almost like I've built this team like I don't I'm not from a team necessarily,
*  but I build this team around me according to every opponent that I fight.
*  So everybody's moving and everybody's mimicking Dominic Cruz and vice versa for TJ, for Marlon.
*  Like it's and these dudes are being compensated. These are being paid.
*  You know what I'm saying? So it's like it's a real business.
*  I just say, hey, just go out there and sparring. Right.
*  Try try everything that you do. It's like that.
*  That's to me. That's that's like a that's like a cut.
*  That's like a chicken with his head cut off. Like you're not.
*  Are you truly improving? Right.
*  Well, what you're saying, all of it 100 percent makes sense.
*  I mean, it's brilliant doing it that way is brilliant.
*  And in the process, man, you cut all the bullshit out.
*  There's things in Jiu Jitsu that doesn't work as a wrestler, which I love.
*  There's things in wrestling that doesn't work in boxing.
*  It's the distance is different like all this.
*  So you almost have to mimic everything that you do in a very technical sense.
*  So when you do this, are you wearing normal four ounce gloves?
*  The whole deal? No, they're more like the sparring gloves like the puffier ones.
*  Yeah, because you don't want to. I mean, have you fucked with any of those onyx ones?
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. With. Yeah.
*  How goddamn good are those? Those are awesome.
*  And those are the best MMA gloves I've ever felt.
*  Once these guys decide to truly launch and whatnot, like I think that company could could completely take over.
*  Like, that's what I'm saying. They make the best shit.
*  Dude, he's such a mad man about it, too.
*  Trevor was on the podcast with Justin describing his process of making those gloves.
*  He got me a pair of them and let me try on those MMA ones.
*  When you compare them to the UFC one side to side, like what? Yeah, this is these are crazy good.
*  They're so much better. They're so well designed, like everything about it, man.
*  Yeah. So it's engineered. Does the padding is better? It's better padding.
*  It feels better. Yes. No, he's a wizard. Yeah.
*  So you're wearing a slightly larger MMA glove. Yeah.
*  Yes, slightly larger. I get Vaseline, the pep talks, like I'm saying bye to everybody.
*  And it feels so normal for me to compete, Joe. Like it's crazy.
*  It really does feel like a sparring session. That's so genius that you you reenacted every week.
*  Yeah, every week. So you get accustomed to it every week.
*  And sometimes you're cranking, sometimes you're pissed.
*  But that's even part of how you can feel during fight week.
*  You know how many times I fight with my coach? It's crazy.
*  Eric, like it's like Captain Eric because it's like, man, we're like brothers.
*  It's like he's a coach, but he's a brother. But you know what I'm saying? Right.
*  So it simulates the fight. Yeah. It's beautiful.
*  That's a genius idea, man. It really is.
*  And so who's mapping out your training camps?
*  Like in terms of like when you do strength conditioning, when is it a collaborative effort?
*  It's a collaborative effort. And a lot of it, I have to pay attention to science.
*  So there's things that my coach have said, there's things that I have said, but it's truly like the science.
*  So in terms of your recovery? Yeah. Yeah.
*  And then what should I eat? Like everything's calculated and how hard I'm going to go like this.
*  So my meals are prepped according to every day, how hard I'm going to go.
*  Really? Yeah. So there's times where I'm doing fives where I'm not going to eat.
*  Like when I'm doing a ten during sparring, you know what I'm saying?
*  And does this go with in terms of your preparation, like your pre-workout meals as well?
*  Yes. So like if you know you're going to spar on Wednesday, at what time in the afternoon do you spar?
*  Sometimes we even simulate the time that we're actually fighting.
*  Oh, okay. So you're not always not always, because you don't want to, you know.
*  Right. Yeah. You don't want to always do that.
*  When would you eat? So if you were going to fight at eight o'clock at night, when would you eat?
*  Oh my God. But that's again, a lot of that stuff you would have to say preference, man.
*  Like personally, I like to have like a big, a big brunch.
*  And I only have. So two-ish? Yeah.
*  Two o'clock in the afternoon? Yeah, about two o'clock, two thirty.
*  So you give yourself like five, six hours.
*  Yeah, because you're nervous. Like if for some reason, like you're nervous, it's hard to digest your food when you're nervous.
*  You know what I'm saying? When you're anxious to do something.
*  So what kind of food do you eat before you fight?
*  Eggs, pancakes. And obviously I need the carbs and whatnot.
*  Just I would just eat normal like bacon. Like I eat pretty clean throughout throughout the whole camp.
*  But you don't have like specific pre-fight meals that you know?
*  No, no. But I think at that point, it's just the psychology side of it.
*  You know what I'm saying? Like I'm going to eat what the serotonin in my mind, like the happiness in me, what it wants.
*  You know what I'm saying? Because I'm going to deserve it when I when I fight that night.
*  You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's a treat. Like it brings happiness to you. I couldn't do that, man.
*  The first time I lost to Demetrius, I was eating chicken breasts.
*  Like right after I beat him and veggies, like I was super light, but I had no fat in me.
*  And I got you know, I got put out. And a lot of them, I owe that you have to have every stone.
*  You have to, you know, turn every stone, man, because there's a lot of details, man.
*  It's very complex, man. And if you can understand the game and on the recovery, on the nutrition, on the happiness, on the on the preparation, on the game planning, all that.
*  I mean, who? So let me ask you this. Who is this company that puts these meals together?
*  They're basing it on when you say like, yes, it depends upon the workout.
*  Like how are they? How are they doing that? Like they're speaking to the physiologist at Euroforce.
*  It's crazy. Yeah. So it's almost like there's a team of a shout out to them to my friends kitchen.
*  There's a team of of man, maybe 12 people.
*  There's a guy that goes in there every time I fight and he's monitoring my heart rate every time.
*  Like he's slow down, slow down and he'll tell the coach and the coaches will tell me like it's all there's a dude in there warming me up before I go train like at my gym, like a personal trainer every single day.
*  Do they give you anything specifically right after you're done training to sort of recovery?
*  Anything for like replenish glycogen? Yeah. Yeah.
*  So that's immediately. What is it? You can I get you can every every what is that? It's just it's just a protein.
*  Okay. It's just a protein that I take sooner or after and even the watermelon like alkaline water.
*  So it's all just down to every T is cross and every eye is dotted. It's all down to the science. Yeah, it's fun.
*  And I think it's really interesting. I think if I have a gift and anything, I've really I've never seen myself coach Joe.
*  I think being a coach is I think being a coach is probably the hardest job because you got to do with pride and then you get and sometimes they leave you with now.
*  But if anyways, if there's one thing that I could do and help people with as if I was a coach would be game planning, actually putting like a game plan together and understanding and putting a putting a solid team together.
*  When did you start doing this thing where you would emulate your opponent's walkout music and your walkout music and the whole deal?
*  Since we started since we fought Demetrius and since I started having success actually since Wilson Hayes.
*  So as soon as I lost to Benavides, I fought Wilson Hayes and then since there and then it got a little more serious when I found Demetrius and then so forth.
*  We just got better better throughout camp. So that was when you decided, okay, we're going to make some wholesale changes and this is a big one.
*  We're going to reenact. Is it your idea to do it that way? I had to I had no choice. Yeah, because I mean your idea to introduce the fighter and have you introduced and the whole deal have the walkout music.
*  No, a lot of that was my coach and a lot of it's me like, all right, man, let's take it to the next level.
*  Like put me in the back. Hey, so who do up at five? Yeah, you know what I'm saying? Right.
*  And I've noticed that since I've done that, Joe, like it's been like, dude, I feel like I'm walking out the why so who are getting so better to do this?
*  The comfort of how I feel my like it's a it's a tactical thing that we developed. Yeah, you've yeah.
*  You figured out a way to make it a normal part of your life. Exactly.
*  That's a big thing about fighters returning, right?
*  The taking a long time off and then coming back. It's very difficult because everything feels weird. Right? Yeah.
*  I remember they were talking about that with Sugar Ray Leonard when Sugar Ray Leonard was in the process of making one of his comebacks.
*  The one of the things they did is they put together might have been for the Haggard fight.
*  They put together fights in the gym like that, a real fight in the gym.
*  So just get used to it like you would fight 12 rounds in the gym. Yeah.
*  I guess it's I guess you go back to it's all it's all just simulating, man.
*  It's not. Yeah. But but this is the thing.
*  The biggest problem that I've seen because I've gone through a lot of coaches now is getting all the coaches on the same page and getting all the coaches, you know, getting them to commit on science.
*  Is that all your response? Do you have to handle everybody or does someone know somebody? Yeah.
*  Yeah. Captain does like he does. He does all that.
*  And, you know, not just that, but even like for me, it's like stem cells.
*  I'm like I did stem cells in Colombia with bioxcellerator out in Colombia about six months ago right after my fight.
*  And, man, I felt so good for this fight.
*  So I have a jacked up neck stem cells like they did a whole you know, they did.
*  They did all the scans you could think of, you know, from x-rays to MRIs and whatnot.
*  And, you know, they would pinpoint like where my my body was was an ache and they started injecting stem cells on me all over my neck, my body that I've never experienced before.
*  And immediately my neck started like the same almost the same day when my neck started feeling better.
*  And ever since then and ever since then, I think three months into it, I met my neck was 100 percent.
*  I wrestled my whole life. Wow.
*  My neck jacked up. So many people have jacked up necks from wrestling too.
*  Backs, backs, necks, so that's shoulders.
*  That's been a big part of my my my recovery and using.
*  Remember specifically what kind of stem cells they were using?
*  Did they tell you? Well, this is it's done in Colombia.
*  So it's the stem cells are being pulled from a baby's umbilical cord.
*  So then, you know, so I don't necessarily know the full science of it.
*  You know, I guess the basic side of it.
*  But, man, I can tell you, my my body feels good.
*  Yeah, it's real shit, man. It works.
*  You know, I have had stem cells done on my knee, my shoulder.
*  I've had a bunch of different things done.
*  Full injuries. And you've done that here.
*  Yeah, I've done it here. Yeah.
*  I don't know if it's the same level because when I was when I was explaining it to or talking to
*  one of my friends about it, they said, what's the difference between that and what they're doing in Panama?
*  Like Dr. Neil Reardon has this clinic down there in Panama.
*  They send a lot of fighters down there as well.
*  I think they're allowed to do anything.
*  I mean, they can get buck wild. They could fill you up with stem cells.
*  Like whatever limitations they might have here in America.
*  They don't they could just they have a fat syringe with them.
*  Get in there. I don't know. I really wish I knew.
*  Yeah, I don't know if this is true, Joe, or maybe you could look it up.
*  I don't know if I don't know if even animals.
*  I don't know if somebody says something is done with the stem cells of an animal, the horse, I think.
*  What? And they're using it on humans.
*  Well, see, that would be weird, man, if people started growing like horse hair all over their body.
*  That's a trip.
*  It didn't happen for two years and two years later, people start growing hair, weird hair on their chest and shit.
*  You know, I mean, I don't think that's going to happen.
*  But I think along the lines of all this medical experimentation, we're going to get some pretty spectacular results.
*  And some of them are going to be bad.
*  Just makes sense. Someone in some other country is going to take they probably already have.
*  They've probably taken some chances and mixed a person with a crocodile or something.
*  I think they've probably done that in some places.
*  Right. For sure. Right. China.
*  It's crazy what our world is coming to, man.
*  And how would it's how different it's like these last 10 years, man, how different has it been?
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  This last 10 months, last 10 weeks, things have been crazy.
*  So weird time to be alive.
*  Things are happening very rapidly from the invention of the cell phone to social media,
*  to the ability to share videos and for people to get information, for people to find out about world events,
*  for people to get together and and try to make change.
*  It's just a different world, man. It's a different world in good ways and in bad ways.
*  It's a different world. People are more disconnected than ever while being more connected than ever.
*  Yeah. There's a lot of things, a lot of things about this life that are really weird.
*  Do you think our world is getting better?
*  I have hope, man. When I see like yesterday, there was part of the George Floyd protest in downtown L.A. had filled this.
*  It's a craziest picture, man. You see the picture of the street filled with people, all nonviolent.
*  So all the looting and all that shit seems to have stopped.
*  And now the people that remain seems to be they seem to be dedicated to change in a way that I can't remember anything like this in my life.
*  I think this is this has a real this man's murder has a real chance of change in the world and changing America for sure.
*  I think it really does. It has a chance in further bridging the divide between people and to to get people to look at things in a better way.
*  Like, look how many people got together for this. Look how many people.
*  I mean, it's it's. It had the real bad parts in the beginning with the looting, but I don't think there can I don't think this is the same people.
*  I think those are people that are broke because covid kept them locked up in their fucking house for a month at a time without any ability to make any money.
*  And I think people saw free shit and then everything got wild and it was jumping off and people were smashing windows and a lot of people just stole shit.
*  That's what I think. But I don't think that's the same thing that's happening.
*  I think that's happening along with this protest.
*  And but the protest is protest is pretty fucking amazing when you when you think that this in our time, we've never had a moment like this where literally the whole country is getting together and saying things have to change and stop.
*  They're defunding the Minneapolis Police Department.
*  What about so I was I was too young, I guess.
*  So I would ask you for this. The Rodney King show in the Rodney King.
*  I wasn't here for that. I watched it on TV, but I was in New York.
*  I came here right after the Rodney King shit. But the thing about the Rodney King shit was it was confined to L.A.
*  You know, people weren't riot rioting about Rodney King in New York.
*  It was just an L.A. thing. These riots were all over the country, man.
*  I mean, the Freddie.
*  What happened is what was that guy's name in Baltimore?
*  Freddie Gray. Yeah, that was the last big one.
*  I remember that was about five years ago.
*  And when Freddie Gray was killed by the cops, they went crazy in Baltimore and lit everything on fire and smashed everything.
*  But it was still just Baltimore, you know, with George Floyd.
*  It's the whole country. Now it's just an excuse to it was.
*  This is what it is, man. It's like people are fed up. People are pissed.
*  Yeah, but it's also they're also broke, man.
*  They got and not it's not through any fault of their own.
*  They got stuck in this covid thing like we all did.
*  They were forced to not be able to work for months and months at a time.
*  And most of them still aren't back at work. Right.
*  So they're broke and they're fucked. And then this is a chance to steal some shit.
*  I don't condone it. I don't condone it.
*  But I saw a lot of what looked like high school kids running out of those things, holding boxes of sneakers like they just were taking advantage of free shit.
*  And yeah, there are some bad people in there, too. There's some criminals in there, too.
*  There's some people that lit churches on fire. There's some people that did some horrible shit.
*  But I think the whole movement is not connected to that.
*  That's just some people that did some shit, taking advantage of a moment in time where everything went haywire.
*  But the people that are marching, they're doing it very peacefully in these enormous groups.
*  I think it's got a real chance of being something that that changes the way cops interact with people.
*  It's got a real chance because it's so big.
*  Yeah, I guess as a fighter, like you don't you don't like you ever like rough play with your friends and your little kid.
*  And then all of a sudden there's like a mosh pit next to you know, you're freaking here.
*  You're being suffocated by everybody's way like that feeling like these cops.
*  They think sometimes the people that are being arrested, they're fighting because that's a lot of pressure on the neck or that's a lot of pressure on the stomach and things like that.
*  Right. And so they make the excuse that you're resisting arrest.
*  But look, everyone's going to resist when you put your fucking shin on their neck.
*  Yeah. You know, that's crazy. That's torture.
*  And also the way the guy was lying down when he had a shin on his neck, he was lying with his neck against like this drain.
*  So there's this like this like cement drain area and his neck is right there.
*  So his shin is on the top of his neck and then the drain area is the bottom.
*  It's fucking horrible. It's horrible to watch, man.
*  It's like you're watching a guy getting tortured to death.
*  Like something has to be done.
*  Now, I don't think it's defund the police.
*  I think it's definitely get rid of anybody like that guy and it's retrain them, train them where they realize that like there's a chance to there's a chance to do this correctly.
*  You have an amazing job.
*  Being a police officer is incredible responsibility.
*  And it takes an incredibly powerful person to do it and not abuse the power that you have because people have a tendency when someone says,
*  Why do I have to do that? Because I fucking told you I'm the cops.
*  Like that's what they're doing when they have that kind of power.
*  They just go to it right away.
*  It's you get you need exceptional people and there's a lot of people that aren't exceptional.
*  And some of those become cops.
*  And you see these non exceptional people who are cops who abuse the fuck out of the power that they've been given.
*  That's the problem.
*  I don't think the problem is that we don't need cops like Jesus Christ.
*  If someone's breaking in your house, you want to be able to call the cops.
*  If you got a real problem in your life and you know there's something going wrong, you want to be able to call the cops.
*  But they have the cops have to have a better relationship with the people in their communities.
*  Yeah, man, I think out of all this craziness going on, I think at the end I think people are starting to unite.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Like even through this whole COVID, not so much what happened with like I think it's it's made people more aware that anything could come and go.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Like look at look at it was a revelation for me.
*  Look at Kobe Bryant situation.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Let's yeah, even the most wealthy of people could die because of a mistake.
*  Yeah, helicopter.
*  You know, you can nothing's going to save you.
*  You don't get say I mean the most beloved of people doesn't matter.
*  You slam into a mountain, you slam into a mountain.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I think through this whole tragedy, I think I think everybody will be will be better off.
*  Like I think we'll be better off.
*  That's the hope.
*  Well, yeah, I guess that's the hope.
*  We just need off the rock and we need more good days.
*  You know, like you have a good day and then a bad day and then another bad day and then another bad day and another bad day and a bad week and a bad month.
*  That's a lot of people right now.
*  And then the riots broke out.
*  And now the riots are over.
*  The looting seems to have stopped.
*  The National Guard's moving back out.
*  Let's hope people keep it peaceful and if people keep it peaceful, it really could change the world.
*  It really could.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's hope on that.
*  Let's hope.
*  So what do you do now, Henry Suhuto?
*  Say if you do decide to not fight again.
*  You're like, I'm done.
*  I did what I had to do.
*  I'm triple C, two world titles and Olympic gold medalist.
*  My name is cemented in the history books.
*  That's who you are.
*  I mean, that's legit.
*  I think I programmed Joe to talk like that.
*  You see, you see, you see my gimmick work.
*  It worked.
*  I'm an analyst.
*  If I look at you completely objectively, even if I didn't know you and you're a great guy, I always enjoy talking to you.
*  But if I didn't know you, I'd be like the motherfucker, like name someone who's done more.
*  Name someone who won two world titles and a fucking gold medal in the Olympics and wrestling and did it all in the most technical of divisions.
*  Yeah.
*  Like I said, Joe, like this is like I'm not saying I'm the best fighter in the world because I'm not, man.
*  There's I would even put Demetrius Johnson like in front of me.
*  I would put a lot of people in front of you.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Even though I do have a window for him.
*  But I wasn't the best wrestler in the world.
*  Like I wasn't like the greatest in the in wrestling, even though it's an Olympic champion.
*  Like I fall into a very secluded group, but I'm one of a lot, you know.
*  But I think if when you collaborate both of my accolades that I've done in sports, that's where the greatest combat out there of all time comes in.
*  And it's yeah, and it's a gimmick.
*  And I say it a lot.
*  But you know, part of it is part of the gimmick is I am telling the truth.
*  Yes.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Like it is a gimmick or not.
*  It's it's in the conversation.
*  You're in the conversation.
*  So maybe in the next 20 years, though, it's a conversation.
*  Like I don't know what the like there's a lot of people that think it should be GSP.
*  And that's in the conversation.
*  He's in the conversation is one of the greatest of all time.
*  Some people say you guys must have forgotten how good Anderson Silver was when he was in his prime.
*  That's true, too.
*  That's in the conversation, too.
*  But you are as well, man.
*  You really are.
*  And whether you you know, whether you were joking around about it or not, you're in the conversation is one of the greatest combat sports athletes of all time.
*  And there's a real good argument that when you beat the guys who you beat, particularly beating Demetrius Johnson, who is untouchable, you know, beating Dominic Cruz the way you did, which is Dominic Cruz is always known for not getting hit.
*  And, you know, you hit him and you hit him a lot.
*  And then coming back from the Marlon Marais fight, holy shit, after that first round to come back and dominate him and just glue yourself to him in the second and then put him away.
*  Fuck, man.
*  I mean, those are pretty, pretty powerful accomplishments.
*  Yeah, no doubt about it.
*  No, I appreciate it, Joe.
*  I appreciate it.
*  And don't know.
*  I think to answer your question, what's next is like there's a there's not only the Volkonoski fight that that you know, because he's he's not that much taller than I call him an overgrown midget.
*  And he's not that he's not that much bigger than me.
*  And I feel like, man, I know I could beat him.
*  I just know it's just be walk around that way about 150.
*  Yeah, but it almost it would have it would be my skill.
*  What would you do to prepare for that?
*  Would you gain any weight or would you just keep the body weight you have?
*  Yeah, I would try to give me be another maybe five, six pounds.
*  But I wouldn't want to like I would try to do it as natural as I possibly can just to have a little more mass.
*  But it's a big jump.
*  Yeah, it does get dangerous when I 45.
*  Yeah, those 45 or some of them are enormous.
*  You know, yeah.
*  But the other one is and there's actually a, you know, the potential in the talks like all these going to talk with Ryan Garcia's manager possibly making a fight with you know, with Ryan Garcia.
*  Ryan Garcia, the boxer boxer.
*  You get a box.
*  Why not?
*  Why not?
*  You call me crazy if things iron out, you know, financially and you know, the cars are played right?
*  Yeah, why not?
*  He tweeted at me.
*  He says, you know, he pretty much called me out.
*  That's the way I took it.
*  Tell him as long as you can throw some leg kicks in there.
*  You get three, three leg kicks around.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's been a lot, but I've actually been pretty busy.
*  Like I was with I was with Tyson and I was were at the AEW event.
*  I was with them.
*  So there's even a potential even over to AEW and or the WWE.
*  Do you remember PKA karate?
*  Do you remember that?
*  No, it was like I think they used to call it the kick of the 90s or the kick of the 80s.
*  Anyway, PKA karate was like kickboxing that you'd watch on ESPN at like three o'clock in the morning.
*  Like I think Jeff Foxworthy even had a bit about it, but it wasn't very good.
*  There was some really good fighters like Rick Rufus.
*  And there was a bunch that were real good.
*  Jerry, Jeremy Trimble, Jerry Trimble.
*  But the the majority were kind of second rate fighters and with no disrespect, they weren't they weren't elite.
*  And so they had to throw a certain amount of kicks.
*  They had throw like six kicks around.
*  Imagine if you had a boxing match where you were allowed to throw just two kicks around.
*  Oh, two leg kicks around.
*  That's all it would take to get that calf kick.
*  That calf kick's been killing people.
*  You have two that land in a round.
*  That's all you're allowed to do.
*  And that's all I need.
*  That's all I need.
*  That would be a fun.
*  Against a boxer?
*  Heck yeah.
*  Like these things are never about that.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, even with PKA karate was all the kicks were above the waist.
*  Like a lot of the PKA.
*  That's one of the one of the things that really defined really woke everyone's eyes up to the power of leg kicks was when Rick Rufus
*  fought this Thai legend.
*  God damn it.
*  I'm going to fuck up his name if I don't hear it see it written out.
*  But this Thai guy, Rick was fucking him up in the beginning.
*  He's real fast and long and hit him with spinning kicks and shit.
*  There's his name.
*  Try saying that name.
*  Chau Ngu Khe Khe.
*  Put that on real quick, Jamie, because watch some of some of the action from that.
*  This dude came out and did the Y crew and everything.
*  And yeah, just take it from there.
*  And Rick Rufus was lighting him up with his hands.
*  Rick was really slick.
*  And he was probably one of the most talented of all the kickboxers back then that were doing the above the waist style.
*  But this dude just kept chopping at his legs, man, and chopping at his legs.
*  And he hurt him.
*  That's what Rick heard him at one point in time.
*  He caught him with the right hand.
*  It looked like.
*  Is that right hand?
*  Yeah.
*  So he had him in real trouble.
*  This is round one.
*  Now, this is the first this is the first ever like mixed or.
*  Yeah, it was well, one of the first ever.
*  This is 1988.
*  And this is actually when I had.
*  Oh, we heard him again.
*  Dropped him.
*  I think did he kick him in the face on the way down to me?
*  He had him fucked up in that first round.
*  Then the fight goes on.
*  The dude survives.
*  And this is like right around the time I was introduced to Muay Thai by this friend of mine that I was training with that was friends with his other dude who was even back in nineteen eighty.
*  He was taking trips over to Thailand and he was learning from the Thais and fighting over there.
*  And he would come back with these like crazy gashes on his head from getting elbowed.
*  But I remember that was the first time anybody ever kicked me in the leg.
*  And I was like, oh, my God, it's so painful.
*  And so this is what happens with Rick Rufus.
*  Rick Rufus had this dude in all kinds of trouble.
*  But this dude, there he is, chopping at those legs and chopping at those legs.
*  And Rick doesn't know what to do.
*  And he's chopping at those legs because Rick's never fought with leg kicks before.
*  If he did, he never fought a guy as good as this gentleman.
*  So this is the fight that's really known as the fight that changed kickboxing.
*  It changed martial arts because people understood like, oh, my God, like what a devastating weapon.
*  Tie kicks to the thighs are.
*  He goes across the front of the thighs.
*  This dude just starts killing his thighs.
*  And what's really interesting is Rick's brother, Duke Rufus, is now one of the top MMA coaches in the world.
*  Look, he's looking at them calling time out.
*  They're making him sit in the corner.
*  They're calling time out.
*  His legs are hurt.
*  Time out.
*  Like the rules are even Jamie knows how ridiculous this is.
*  The rules were crazy back then.
*  I'm getting into this fight.
*  Yeah.
*  I've seen this before.
*  I believe he gets up and I believe he keeps going.
*  And I believe the dude chops his legs again and then he's done.
*  But is he going to let him go?
*  I think they might let him go.
*  Are they stopping the fight?
*  Is this crazy?
*  Like they haven't stopped the fight.
*  They haven't stopped the fight with leg kicks, even though he clearly got fucked up by leg kicks to the point where he was incapacitated.
*  But they're going to allow him to keep fighting, which is just preposterous.
*  So he gets to walk it off like, all right, let's keep going.
*  Like this is how weird martial arts were back then.
*  We didn't think we didn't think that those were legitimate.
*  Look at this guy just chopping at those legs, man.
*  Beautiful Thai technique.
*  Just so classic with the stance.
*  He's got that the hands way up high over his forehead with that that stepping motion.
*  So anyway, keep it going because they keep going.
*  It makes it into the second round.
*  You know what?
*  This fight reminds me of the beer Mariah, man.
*  Yeah, in a lot of ways, except the chopping down in this case worked.
*  So Rick is like really incapacitated by this point.
*  Look, he just got chopped across the leg again.
*  That's only the third round.
*  Look at that again.
*  Boom and boom and boom.
*  So what's interesting is that Duke Rufus was in his corner and Duke was like 19 at the time.
*  He's a baby face Duke Rufus who now was one of the best MMA trainers in the world.
*  And Duke was saying, oh, I just don't think it takes that much talent to kick someone in the legs.
*  And he became like one of the best coaches and a world champion himself at Muay Thai.
*  Like, no, this is how and this is not to knock Dick or or knock Rick Rufus or Duke Rufus.
*  They're both awesome.
*  This is just to say this was where martial arts was in 1988.
*  We really just didn't know there was a there was a developmental period where we just didn't know.
*  And see, Rick is just still they're still going to let him fight.
*  Those are hard kicks, too.
*  And I'm sorry.
*  I mean, even though they're stopping it like that, those are hard kicks and he's still he's still going to fight.
*  He's going to be fucked for weeks.
*  Right.
*  I mean, look, he could barely walk and they're going to let him keep going.
*  Give it a little little forward head.
*  What is he going to say to him?
*  Oh, you got to he's warning him.
*  You threw him to the ground.
*  OK, so they tell him you can't dump, which is hilarious because he's destroying his legs is what he's doing.
*  So they got him in the corner.
*  Look at some of this is the end of the fight.
*  The end of the fight was ruthless.
*  And you got to think like Rick Rufus is so goddamn tough.
*  He's so goddamn tough to just have endured this because he doesn't know how to check it.
*  He's just taking them all.
*  Like they're like, boom.
*  And that was it.
*  That last one, dude.
*  Hi, hi, shin bone across the thigh.
*  And I think that's the end of the fight, if I remember correctly.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  One more.
*  It's another one.
*  Oh, my God.
*  They let him get back up.
*  They dusted him off.
*  He's still just getting fucking.
*  It's all leg kicks, man.
*  It's crazy.
*  Oh, I'm surprised.
*  Dude, he's taking a lot of pain.
*  Do you imagine how horrible this must have been to him?
*  That was the end that we did before.
*  Yeah, that's the end.
*  Is that the end of the fight or does it keep going?
*  Oh, it is the end.
*  OK, it just replays all the other stuff.
*  Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was the end.
*  We were watching the same round three times.
*  I don't know.
*  No, I think it went three rounds, if I remember correctly.
*  But it was just a horrific example of how this is the development of martial arts.
*  This is one of the steps on the way to the UFC is that we had to realize about leg kicks.
*  It's a ruthless fight to watch.
*  He looks like he's in super pain.
*  Oh, my God, dude.
*  Well, you remember that one cat that fought in the UFC that almost lost his leg due to compartment syndrome?
*  Did you ever see that scar?
*  No.
*  You want to freak out?
*  Maybe rethink a comeback.
*  I'm going to show you something.
*  This dude had compartment syndrome in his thigh.
*  Sorry, I'm blanking on his name.
*  Austin Hubbard.
*  Austin Hubbard, who's a tough motherfucker.
*  That's him.
*  OK.
*  And they cut him from his ankle all the way up to the top of his thigh.
*  Yeah, you scared you freaking out.
*  Well, I'm trying to find a good.
*  They're all disgusting.
*  Look at that.
*  People have photoshopped it.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah.
*  They may look like a subway sandwich and shit.
*  That's his leg.
*  Look at that.
*  What is it?
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  What is that?
*  That's his fucking leg.
*  His leg is so it was so swollen and destroyed and the tissue was so fucked up.
*  That big thing on the tube is a drain to drain all the swelling in the in the fluid.
*  So they had to open up his leg.
*  I mean, it's one of the biggest scars I've ever seen.
*  It goes all the way down to his knee, like from the top of his hip all the way down to his knee.
*  And they had to open his leg up because after the fight, his leg was just destroyed.
*  Look at that.
*  Who's that?
*  I don't know.
*  I thought that might have been it.
*  I don't think so.
*  That guy's got Everlast shorts on.
*  I don't think that's the same cat.
*  I don't know.
*  There's a lot of those dudes from Muay Thai fights afterwards.
*  They have giant swollen legs.
*  But that was that was definitely his leg because John Anik showed it to me in between fights.
*  And he's like, have you seen Harvard's injury?
*  And I'm like, oh, I heard about it.
*  He's like, no, no, no.
*  You got to see it.
*  Look, look, that's what it looked like.
*  Why?
*  Look at the size of that scar, man.
*  And look at the blackness of all the tissue like it's all rotting and it's all destroyed from shins.
*  But that's terrifying.
*  That fucking shit is terrifying.
*  And that is what Rick Rufus went through.
*  Just got his legs destroyed.
*  I think I think I'm going to stay retired.
*  I forget what we were.
*  Yeah, I did.
*  Yeah, it looked like like some pulled pork.
*  What were we just talking about?
*  We brought that up.
*  What was next?
*  We're now we're just talking about that career.
*  And you were talking about possibly boxing.
*  Yeah, possibly Ryan Garcia, man.
*  So that's just for a giant payday.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Obviously to win, obviously to fight.
*  What does he walk around?
*  He's the boxers don't get as crazy as we do.
*  You know what I mean?
*  They don't get crazy heavy, but I'm walking around 150.
*  So if we do fight, it probably be at 35, which is good.
*  I think I think McGregor.
*  I think McGregor's done it with with Mayweather.
*  I think if Ryan wants to do it, then I think it's how much time
*  would you need to prepare for something like that?
*  Probably about two to three months to about three months,
*  three months.
*  Yeah.
*  And like three months at least.
*  How much on a regular basis is boxing a part of your workout?
*  I know that you you did a lot of amateur boxing right out of your
*  Olympic career.
*  You went right into amateur boxing.
*  You did that for how long?
*  I did that for three years.
*  And that was thinking about trying to make the Olympic team again.
*  Now, once you went back to MMA training, how boxing focus is your
*  MMA training?
*  It's a lot, but it's also different.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  So now it's just I don't even call it Muay Thai or boxing.
*  Like it's all it's just MMA.
*  Right.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Distance.
*  Everything's just different.
*  And then you got to do it according to your your style, man,
*  according to what you what you feel comfortable throwing.
*  So all of your workouts are MMA.
*  You know, they're all.
*  Yeah, they're all.
*  I'm cutting all the bullshit out, man.
*  I think when you get to that level where, OK, man, to a two hour
*  striking class is just too much.
*  Right.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Two hours of jiu-jitsu class.
*  That's not MMA base.
*  It's not good.
*  And it would be too much.
*  What about when you're done with a fight?
*  When you're done with a fight in between fights, do you work out just
*  to stay fit?
*  Do you work out for fun?
*  Do you go and do like a jiu-jitsu class with a gi on or anything like that?
*  Or do you stick to sports specific workouts even in between fights?
*  Yeah, even in between fights.
*  Or I could return depending on the art that I really got to develop.
*  So I could go back to just a two hour class in boxing or two or an hour
*  and a half of boxing, an hour of just pure wrestling.
*  So you have the ability to do that.
*  But there comes a time where you just got to getting maybe maybe within
*  eight to nine weeks.
*  OK, you got to transition.
*  Everything's just MMA specific.
*  And then having your partner.
*  Josie Aldo had a different style than Dominic.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  And I was able to understand Dominic for because he was a last minute
*  replacement the last four weeks.
*  And how much time do you spend and how much effort do you spend weeding
*  out sparring partners and getting the right ones?
*  And how important is that for a camp?
*  That's my coach.
*  That's my coach's job.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  That's for him to call and to see and people to see.
*  And trust and all that.
*  And the other thing is, it's hard.
*  It's hard what I do.
*  I mean, I got I got I got a guy alternating like every run.
*  I'm doing a five round fight and I got a fresh dude in every round when
*  I'm going hard.
*  Right.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  So a lot of like the act, the practices that I'm doing, like I'm really
*  investing in what I'm doing in sparring.
*  Do these guys know you already?
*  I mean, have you trained with them previously when they make it to a camp?
*  Or this is the first time you've ever trained with?
*  Yes, the first time you ever change with us.
*  So it becomes a little bit of a challenge.
*  So it becomes a very to relationship with a talk to a very business like, you
*  know what I'm saying?
*  It's like, hey, man, you're you're so focused and you'll be compensated to do
*  such and such.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  And when you say that, like, say if you're fighting someone who has like an
*  unusual southpaw style, they have to when they spar with you, they should be
*  sparring from a southpaw style.
*  Yeah.
*  Southpaw style.
*  And always even from the height, like I don't I don't if I'm when I fought
*  Dominic, everybody had to be exactly Dominic size and they had to be able to
*  move like him or try to move like in the best as possible.
*  So I'm not sparring with the guys about my size.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Yeah.
*  So it depends on who you're fighting.
*  How hard is it to get a guy to mimic Dominic Cruz?
*  Actually, they're out there, man.
*  There's a lot of guys that grew up watching Dominic fight.
*  A lot of there is a guy at our gym, a couple of guys at our gym that that moves
*  just like really.
*  Yeah.
*  So he's he's with his whole art like they studied him.
*  They were able to develop certain things and they're they're the ones that were
*  telling us like, don't even go for the smoke bomb.
*  The hands take the legs off, smoke and the hands take the legs off.
*  And something that I saw from from this whole COVID thing for finding an empty
*  arena is our corner were prepared.
*  Check this out.
*  Like this is how prepared we are.
*  Like we were even prepared to the point we're using code words.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  So it was every time I heard spaghetti, take the legs out pumpkin.
*  You know, let's start going up top.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Potatoes is, you know, it's it's it's sticking the bodies.
*  You know, you know what I'm saying?
*  I could hear clearly what that one next corner was saying during the fight.
*  They're like, left high kick.
*  I could hear it.
*  But I'm just like, so it made me understand that maybe the sport of fight, maybe
*  it's just you fighting.
*  But when you're able to study, just like even your surroundings, you understand,
*  do this.
*  This is a team sport, man.
*  His coaches were giving me so many clues.
*  It was fun.
*  It was fun.
*  It was fun.
*  And it was it was it was fun.
*  I don't know how the other people I thought what the I've been feeling.
*  I've been fighting with tons of people in the crowd.
*  Like it was fun to just hear the corners, man.
*  It was a treat for me.
*  Was it weird that that's going to be your last fight?
*  At least you've experienced it once, right?
*  To do it that way.
*  I think that's why I liked it.
*  It was so personable, man.
*  I know every detail in the UFC from the security guard to Heidi.
*  Like I had a relationship with these people, Jeff Novitski.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Without having to take a picture or a fan wants to see you.
*  Yeah, I'm giving back to the people that have that have been here the last, I don't
*  know what, five, six years.
*  Was it more or less relaxed when there's no audience?
*  More relaxed, more relaxed.
*  Yeah, way more relaxed.
*  Seems like it would be.
*  Look at the fights, man.
*  Look at this card.
*  Do you think you think the fights would be like that if there's a there's a big crowd,
*  like people were into their groove, man, whether you're winning or losing.
*  Maybe it would have.
*  Well, there's also the factor of the smaller octagon.
*  What do you think about that?
*  They're using for the apex center, the 25 foot octagon.
*  I love it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I think it's you want to see blood, Joe.
*  I want to see blood.
*  I want to see exchanges.
*  I feel like you can still move in a 25 foot octagon.
*  You can still get away from shit, but you shouldn't be able to get away from everything
*  all the time.
*  Like the bigger the octagon, the more it comes to if you're going to use an octagon at all,
*  I think small ones better.
*  My feeling is you shouldn't use anything.
*  My feeling is it should be in a football field, mad up a fucking football field.
*  I'm for real.
*  I'm not joking.
*  I've said this a million times.
*  Just let the go go up the stairs.
*  Well, there's no obstacles, no wall to press someone up against.
*  If someone gets up, they have to get up on their own.
*  They have to be flat on their back in the middle of nowhere and they can't use the wall
*  to get up.
*  I feel like there's a factor and I don't think it's a good or a bad thing, but there is a
*  recognizable factor that the cage provides.
*  The good thing, if you want to say a good thing, the smaller cage is better because
*  it can't go anywhere.
*  The bad thing that there's a cage at all and that it does get in the way, it does become
*  a thing.
*  Yeah.
*  If you're stuck and someone's clenching you against the cage and kneeing you, your back
*  is against the cage.
*  There's a barrier.
*  You're stuck.
*  I feel like it would be better if there wasn't a thing that someone could press you against
*  that would be good for their advance.
*  Do you know what I'm saying?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Now I hear you, but it's almost like the Kumite.
*  Yeah.
*  Obviously, but bigger.
*  Yeah, bigger.
*  Just a big open basketball-sized court.
*  Put some crocodiles out.
*  I don't know.
*  No.
*  Make it real right, a big wave on the other side.
*  I could argue that it's a dumb argument because I also think that it's better to have a 25-foot
*  octagon than it is to have a 30-foot octagon.
*  I think it's better to have it smaller so you can't get away.
*  If you're going to have a thing where someone could press someone against it, I think it
*  should be smaller.
*  But I'm a moron.
*  You don't have to listen to me.
*  Yeah, no.
*  I get you.
*  It's ... If you're fighting the woods sometimes, it's more practical.
*  Would you prefer the larger octagon that you've fought in in Jacksonville or the smaller one
*  like the Apex Center for your style?
*  As a wrestler, if I'm going to wrestle, it's going to be the smaller one.
*  I fought in both.
*  If I was a striker, if I was somebody like ... Just one of the strikers, a good striker,
*  maybe Sean, maybe O'Malley, I would need a bigger cage because the wrestler's out there
*  to cut distance.
*  If you know how to use a cage, it's a powerful tool.
*  What do you think about the possibility of becoming a coach?
*  Is that something you really consider because you were talking about the heartbreaks of
*  it and why was ... I think you would be an amazing coach.
*  Yeah.
*  But maybe to a certain extent, man.
*  I think- Maybe to the right people.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  It's hard, Joe.
*  It's hard, man.
*  This is why because there's some people ... We talked about heart and ability today.
*  There's some people that have a lot of heart, but their ability is just like, dude, when
*  are you going to get it?
*  Right, right.
*  Or vice versa.
*  I think because I know what it takes and if I don't see that from a certain person, then
*  I can't be a part of it.
*  Let me put this in your head.
*  Think about this team that you put together.
*  Think about this scientific approach that you guys put together for formulating your
*  camps whether from nutrition and training and recovery and all that stuff.
*  Now imagine doing the same sort of work with bringing you disciples.
*  Someone who puts the same amount of effort into finding fighters that are worthy of your
*  kind of coaching.
*  You could develop a fucking empire.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, maybe.
*  Maybe.
*  I want to get into real estate, man.
*  I want to do ... Do you?
*  Yeah.
*  I want to do that.
*  You want to get paid.
*  I want to get paid, man.
*  I get it.
*  I love freedom, Joe, more than anything.
*  I've competed my whole life from age 11, Joe.
*  I have over like 600, maybe 700 wrestling matches, competitions, man, boxing, wrestling.
*  From age 11 to 33, that's all I've ever done.
*  That's all I've ever known was competition.
*  You're done.
*  To compete.
*  I'm done, Joe.
*  Unless that Ryan Garcia or maybe the Volkonosky, but even then if it doesn't happen or whatever,
*  it's okay, man.
*  I'm happy.
*  Whatever happens, man, what you've accomplished so far has been truly spectacular.
*  I really believe that you could do anything you want, whatever it is, whether you decide
*  to focus on real estate or anything.
*  A man who can do what you've done can do anything.
*  I think it's one of the best lessons of martial arts.
*  The amount of power that you have to have in your mind to push your body to do what
*  you've done, to push your will to get those workouts in and to compete when it's game
*  day.
*  You've done that.
*  You've done it in a way, you've overcome the bad, and you're getting out while you're still
*  fresh.
*  You're a young man.
*  What are you, 33?
*  33.
*  That ain't shit.
*  You're a young man.
*  You have all this energy, man.
*  I got some hairs on my, I got some grays on my.
*  You've had a very strenuous life.
*  Very few people have put their body to the kind of strain that you have in all those
*  33 years, but you can do anything, man.
*  Anything.
*  Whatever you want.
*  You get out with your wits intact.
*  Yeah, no, thank you, Joe.
*  Thank you for, man, thank you for everything, man.
*  This was a fun time.
*  My pleasure.
*  Getting a chance to share my knowledge and obviously getting a chance to hear your knowledge.
*  It's been a good time.
*  Can you mind if I give a couple of thank yous here?
*  Yeah, please.
*  I have a special thank you to my new sponsor, Smart Cups.
*  That was just, your friend who owns Smart Cups.
*  Yeah, Chris Kinnick.
*  He just showed me a video of what it is.
*  Can we say it?
*  Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
*  You want to talk about it?
*  Yeah, you want to explain it, Joe?
*  Let's see.
*  They figured out a way to have 3D print nutrients and flavor in the cups.
*  So you take the cup.
*  It's the craziest shit I've ever seen.
*  There's a cup.
*  You buy like a box of cups.
*  You pour the water in the cup and it turns into this electrolyte drink because the 3D
*  printing of all the stuff is actually on the surface of the cup.
*  It's pretty fucking badass.
*  Yeah, it's a trip.
*  So let's say, I'll give you an example.
*  Let's say you go to a ballpark and you want a lime.
*  The ballpark's for 50,000 people.
*  It's the world champion.
*  They're going to have a bunch of limes like that, dude.
*  It's expensive.
*  That's what it looks like, folks.
*  So that's what the 3D printing flavor and nutrition that's in these cups.
*  So for instance, that picture right there, if you like your beer with lime, that would
*  have a printed actual lime.
*  So you could have a cup that was a lime cup.
*  You pour your beer into the, like you say, if you have a Corona, you pour it into the
*  lime cup and you get that lime flavor in your beer.
*  No, but check this out too.
*  Sometimes you don't even need alcohol.
*  You just need water because there's already like...
*  Alcohol in there?
*  What?
*  Yeah, there could be.
*  You just need water.
*  It turns into beer.
*  Really?
*  There's a mad scientist next to you.
*  Is that real?
*  Yeah.
*  That's crazy.
*  So it's a trip.
*  Well, listen, brother, I've said it before, but I really mean it.
*  It's an honor to call your fights.
*  One of the coolest things about being a fan of the UFC and then being able to be a commentator
*  is like, I know I've experienced history.
*  I've been there and I've had this incredible job where I get to talk during some of the
*  greatest fights of all time and try to do justice to those fights and try to let people
*  know how insanely impressive some of these performances that you've accomplished have
*  been to me as a person who's been watching fights my whole life.
*  So as a fan and as a person who gets to do it professionally, it's been an honor for
*  real.
*  Thank you, Joe.
*  Thank you, Joe.
*  That means a lot to me.
*  That means a lot to me.
*  Thank you for giving me the platform.
*  I haven't really shared a lot of things that I've shared today and there's no other platform
*  here than the Joe Rogan Show.
*  I'm honored, brother.
*  Thank you so much for being here.
*  Thanks to everybody for listening.
*  Henry Cejudo, it's over, baby.
*  He's done with you people.
*  Intergender champ.
*  Intergender champ.
