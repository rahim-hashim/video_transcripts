*  It was great. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=23.0s)]
*  That's a great room. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=24.0s)]
*  Great room, great crowds, been having fun. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=25.0s)]
*  Austin had barbecue about 15 times already. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=28.0s)]
*  Every time I come here, I just, I don't have solid shits. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=31.0s)]
*  It's a tough town to have solid shit in. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=35.0s)]
*  It's hard to find fiber. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=37.0s)]
*  Do you have an issue after you eat there, when you say solid shit? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=39.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=43.0s)]
*  What do you mean by solid shit? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=44.0s)]
*  I mean, I just, yeah, I mean there's just no fiber in the meal. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=46.0s)]
*  It's just meat, jalapenos, cheddar sausage. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=49.0s)]
*  That's just your pie, there's a little fiber in those. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=52.0s)]
*  A little tiny bit, not enough to- [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=53.0s)]
*  Cold slaw? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=55.0s)]
*  A little cold slaw. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=56.0s)]
*  You get the cold slaw and then lube up the pipes? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=57.0s)]
*  Yeah, I got some peach cobbler. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=59.0s)]
*  There is a layer of grease around it, but I don't know, yeah. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=63.0s)]
*  The body shape is consistent amongst people that enjoy barbecue. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=66.0s)]
*  It is a hearty body shape. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=71.0s)]
*  It's very parish, yeah. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=73.0s)]
*  Very farmer fucking bear hug-ish. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=74.0s)]
*  What happened there? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=78.0s)]
*  Lost me. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=79.0s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=80.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it's the fucking best barbecue on earth. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=81.0s)]
*  You know what all came from, German immigrants? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=83.0s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=86.0s)]
*  I thought it was like black people food. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=87.0s)]
*  Adam Curry explained the whole thing to me. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=89.0s)]
*  Germans came over here from Germany and they smoked their meat over there. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=91.0s)]
*  It's a common way they prepare meat. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=96.0s)]
*  So like smoked sausages and stuff like that, like those jalapeno cheddar sausages they have at Terry Black's, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=99.0s)]
*  that like originally started out German food. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=104.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're like really good at smoking meat. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=108.0s)]
*  Like when you go to Montreal and they have smoked meat sandwiches, you know, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=111.0s)]
*  like the Jews, that's the way they handle their brisket and their corned beef and stuff like that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=117.0s)]
*  And then they do it differently over here, but it all comes from Germany. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=122.0s)]
*  Ah, yeah. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=125.0s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=126.0s)]
*  That is wild. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=127.0s)]
*  They do like their meat over there. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=128.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=129.0s)]
*  I went there, their cuisine is atrocious. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=130.0s)]
*  Is it? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=132.0s)]
*  German food? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=133.0s)]
*  I went to like a four-star German restaurant in Munich and it was just, it was ballpark food. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=134.0s)]
*  It was like Frank, applesauce, sauerkraut and mustard. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=139.0s)]
*  When you go to a place like Italy, the food is so good. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=143.0s)]
*  It's amazing they get them to go to war. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=146.0s)]
*  You know, like I think that's my theory, my conspiracy theory about why English food was so bland. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=148.0s)]
*  England dominated the fucking world forever with that bullshit ass food. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=154.0s)]
*  And the Germans too, yeah. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=158.0s)]
*  They don't know fucking great food. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=160.0s)]
*  Thailand's not taking over anybody. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=162.0s)]
*  Right, yeah. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=164.0s)]
*  They don't enjoy life, so they're motivated. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=165.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=168.0s)]
*  Like how did they talk the Italians into doing it? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=169.0s)]
*  They barely did. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=171.0s)]
*  I mean, they weren't that good, no offense, they weren't that great fighters. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=173.0s)]
*  I mean, they invaded Greece World War II. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=175.0s)]
*  We beat the shit out of them. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=177.0s)]
*  Yeah, listen, my people are not designed for that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=178.0s)]
*  No. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=180.0s)]
*  They're not designed to go to war. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=181.0s)]
*  But they were with the Roman army, which is wild. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=182.0s)]
*  That is true. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=184.0s)]
*  Back then when syphilis was running rampant, everybody was dying when they were 12, you could get people to fight easier. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=185.0s)]
*  Well, was that before Marco Polo? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=191.0s)]
*  Like maybe that was before Marco Polo brought the noodle over. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=192.0s)]
*  Like maybe that was before pre- [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=196.0s)]
*  Maybe the noodle ruined everything. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=198.0s)]
*  They figured out pasta. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=200.0s)]
*  Yeah, once they got the pasta, they were like, dude, I can't. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=201.0s)]
*  What the fuck is this? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=203.0s)]
*  This is too good, I can't. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=204.0s)]
*  You know, it's interesting, the food that we consider Italian food, we think of it as East Coast immigrant Italian food. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=206.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=213.0s)]
*  You know, I learned that from Bourdain. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=214.0s)]
*  He explained all that shit to me. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=216.0s)]
*  It's like we think of our food over here is like what immigrants would eat and they would make everything very filling and, you know, a lot of pasta and a lot of like breading in the meatballs and lasagna and all that stuff. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=218.0s)]
*  You don't really find that that much in Italy. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=232.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, you know, you can't find a good chicken parm hero. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=234.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=238.0s)]
*  Or lasagna. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=239.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=240.0s)]
*  A spicy rigatoni. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=241.0s)]
*  That's fucking American food. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=242.0s)]
*  Yeah, you get it in Italy, they give you like four gnocchi. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=244.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=247.0s)]
*  And it's like very light and they eat such small portions. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=248.0s)]
*  And when you're American, you're like, where is the lumberjack special? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=251.0s)]
*  Well, I guess that's probably real similar to a lot of Chinese food over here, right? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=254.0s)]
*  Like, I mean, how authentic is there's a lot of Americanized Chinese food with a heavy monosodium glutamate. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=258.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=264.0s)]
*  Which by the way is fucking delicious. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=265.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=267.0s)]
*  There's a reason why they use it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=268.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=269.0s)]
*  And yeah, I don't think they I don't think they have General Tso's chicken over there. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=270.0s)]
*  Probably don't. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=274.0s)]
*  I don't even think Indians have chicken tikka masala. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=275.0s)]
*  Just they figured out something like white Americans like and they went with it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=278.0s)]
*  Oh, sort of like when you get Chilean sea bass. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=281.0s)]
*  That's not a sea bass. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=285.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=286.0s)]
*  That's a cod. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=287.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=288.0s)]
*  And if you get chicken in China, I think like it's the foot. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=289.0s)]
*  Like, you know how like you'll hear you'll sue if you see a chicken foot over there. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=291.0s)]
*  They're like, mmm, that's what I was hoping for. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=295.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=298.0s)]
*  Can I get some rat fritters on the side? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=299.0s)]
*  That's what interesting about some cultures. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=301.0s)]
*  They take food that we would just chuck and they make it delicious. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=303.0s)]
*  Like Mexicans with menudo when you get all the the the what is it called? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=306.0s)]
*  It's intestines. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=311.0s)]
*  But it's what is the word for it? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=312.0s)]
*  Tripe? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=314.0s)]
*  Yes, tripe. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=315.0s)]
*  So it's like cow stomach and stuff like that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=316.0s)]
*  And it's all boiled up in this pot with this like heavy, thick, spicy red sauce. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=318.0s)]
*  You ever have menudo like real menudo from a real legit Mexican spot? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=323.0s)]
*  I haven't. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=327.0s)]
*  No. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=328.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=329.0s)]
*  There were some spots in L.A. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=330.0s)]
*  I remember I was in L.A. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=331.0s)]
*  I remember I was in L.A. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=332.0s)]
*  and I was like, oh, my God, I'm going to get menudo. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=333.0s)]

*  They only cook it up on Saturday and Sunday when everyone's hung over. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=341.0s)]
*  It's fucking insane. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=343.0s)]
*  Well, the Greeks have the same thing. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=345.0s)]
*  It's a delicacy and I love it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=347.0s)]
*  And I was raised on it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=348.0s)]
*  It's called Kokoretsi, which is the guts of the lamb wrapped in the intestines. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=349.0s)]
*  And it's delicious. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=354.0s)]
*  And then my I'd said the soup. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=355.0s)]
*  And it's delicious. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=357.0s)]
*  Isn't that what chitlins is? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=358.0s)]
*  Kind of. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=360.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think it's the same thing. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=361.0s)]
*  How do you spell it differently? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=362.0s)]
*  Right. It's spelled like chitterlings, I think. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=364.0s)]
*  And I think they do the pig. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=366.0s)]
*  It's the pig intestines. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=368.0s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=369.0s)]
*  Yeah, we do. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=370.0s)]
*  We do the lamb, dude. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=371.0s)]
*  Greeks are the biggest predator of lambs. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=372.0s)]
*  Mm. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=374.0s)]
*  It's not like the wolves. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=375.0s)]
*  It's Greeks. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=376.0s)]
*  Lambs. Very good for you. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=377.0s)]
*  It's great. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=378.0s)]
*  It's very easy to digest, apparently. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=379.0s)]
*  For like, you know, Jordan Peterson is on that carnivore diet thing. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=380.0s)]
*  His wife is, but she only eats lamb. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=385.0s)]
*  And she's found like that's her sweet spot is just only eating lamb. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=387.0s)]
*  It's very nutritious. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=391.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's sweet meat. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=392.0s)]
*  It's very good. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=394.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's very good. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=395.0s)]
*  But it's also a baby lamb. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=396.0s)]
*  Or a baby sheep. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=398.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=399.0s)]
*  That's what a lamb is. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=400.0s)]
*  Yeah. What can you do? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=401.0s)]
*  It's like we have a name for it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=402.0s)]
*  We're just eating babies. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=404.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=405.0s)]
*  But that's what veal is, too. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=406.0s)]
*  Like if you have a veal parmesan. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=408.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=410.0s)]
*  You're eating a baby cow. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=411.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=413.0s)]
*  But the thing is like, is that worse or better than killing it when it's older and eating? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=414.0s)]
*  I was about to think that. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=418.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=419.0s)]
*  Is it better like to not let it have a good life so it doesn't? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=420.0s)]
*  I think it's fine. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=423.0s)]
*  The lamb thing is different than the veal thing, though. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=425.0s)]
*  Because the veal thing is actually a process where they give a baby cow anemia. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=428.0s)]
*  The way they used to do it, they used to tie it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=433.0s)]
*  It's really horrific. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=435.0s)]
*  They used to tie them up and they would feed them like, some of them were milk fed. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=437.0s)]
*  They would call it milk fed veal. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=443.0s)]
*  But I don't know if that's how they did it. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=446.0s)]
*  I don't know what they fed them. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=448.0s)]
*  But whatever they fed them, they kept them in the dark. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=449.0s)]
*  They kept them motionless so that they have no muscle. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=452.0s)]
*  Like whatever you get, it's a very small amount of meat that's on it in comparison to a cow, obviously. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=456.0s)]
*  But that meat is just soft as butter, which is kind of creepy. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=461.0s)]
*  It's creepy, but... [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=465.0s)]
*  Not even kind of. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=466.0s)]
*  But are we anthropomorphizing it, though? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=467.0s)]
*  Like does the lamb know? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=470.0s)]
*  Does the lamb know? Does the animal know? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=471.0s)]
*  We know. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=473.0s)]
*  Yeah, we know. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=474.0s)]
*  We know. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=475.0s)]
*  That's why, to me, it's always been weird if people freak out if you eat bears. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=476.0s)]
*  If you tell people that you eat bear, they're like, what the fuck is wrong with you? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=482.0s)]
*  If there's a thing out there that you should be eating, it's bears. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=485.0s)]
*  But trigonosis. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=490.0s)]
*  Yeah, but you just same with pork. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=491.0s)]
*  You just cook it. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=493.0s)]
*  You just have to make sure you have a meat thermometer. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=494.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=496.0s)]
*  You've got to be perfect with bear, though, or else you can't know what you're doing. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=497.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can get it. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=501.0s)]
*  Apparently, according to my friend Steve Rinella, who's an expert in this, because he actually has trigonosis, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=503.0s)]
*  he said that 90% of all the cases in trigonosis in this country come from people eating black bear. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=508.0s)]
*  How many people are eating black bear? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=516.0s)]
*  A lot. You'd be surprised. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=518.0s)]
*  You'd be surprised particularly in Alaska. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=520.0s)]
*  They eat it a lot up there. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=522.0s)]
*  They eat it a lot in places where it's traditional to hunt there, like Montana, even in New Jersey. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=524.0s)]
*  New Jersey finally is reinstituting the bear hunt, because the governor, one of the things he ran on was stopping the bear hunt. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=530.0s)]
*  But then human bear encounters rose by over 200%. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=537.0s)]
*  There was a lot of human bear encounters with aggressive bears. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=541.0s)]
*  And so they said, oh, you really do need to manage these populations, because they just keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=545.0s)]
*  And it only takes a couple of years for a bear to get big enough to fuck you up. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=550.0s)]
*  It's not like a person. It's quick. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=554.0s)]
*  And so then you have these four or five-year-old giant bears running around, eating people's dogs, tearing up your neighborhood. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=558.0s)]
*  They're like real predators. They don't know the rules. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=564.0s)]
*  They have them up by me, and supposedly, are they dangerous? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=567.0s)]
*  Because people are like, oh, they're not dangerous. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=571.0s)]
*  Of course they're dangerous. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=573.0s)]
*  They always run away. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=574.0s)]
*  Most of the time they run away. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=575.0s)]
*  But they're 100% capable of killing you. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=576.0s)]
*  That's dangerous. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=578.0s)]
*  It's not a chicken. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=579.0s)]
*  It's not a wild chicken running loose. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=580.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=582.0s)]
*  Did you ever see that video of the two duking it out in Far Rockaway, New Jersey? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=583.0s)]
*  No. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=588.0s)]
*  Oh my God, dude. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=589.0s)]
*  They're so far rock away. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=590.0s)]
*  It's like a very nice neighborhood, very suburban neighborhood. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=591.0s)]
*  And there's these bears that are easy 300-plus pounds, and they're going to war, knocking over trash cans, fighting the street. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=595.0s)]
*  Cars are pulled over and stopped, and they're fighting over which bear gets to raid the garbage. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=602.0s)]
*  Because they all eat the garbage. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=607.0s)]
*  When a bear finds out there's garbage in an area, he's coming back. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=609.0s)]
*  So look at these guys. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=613.0s)]
*  Imagine your fucking house. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=614.0s)]
*  Look at the size of those things, man. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=616.0s)]
*  And they're duking it out right on the front lawn. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=618.0s)]
*  Those are big-ass bears, man. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=620.0s)]
*  They're shooting a fair one. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=622.0s)]
*  And so these bears are fighting over territory. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=623.0s)]
*  The territory being the garbage. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=627.0s)]
*  Yeah, the garbage. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=629.0s)]
*  And also breeding. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=630.0s)]
*  So this is probably around the time where the females are getting hot. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=631.0s)]
*  So it could be one of two things they're fighting over, or both of those things. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=634.0s)]
*  Or just dominance. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=637.0s)]
*  Like they don't want another big male trying to take over the territory. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=638.0s)]
*  So these guys are like lions that are duking it out, except they're doing it in front of someone's fucking mailbox. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=642.0s)]
*  That's a giant predator, man. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=648.0s)]
*  It's crazy, yeah. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=650.0s)]
*  Like if that thing chased you down and wanted to kill you, you would have zero chance of survival. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=651.0s)]
*  Zero. Absolutely zero. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=655.0s)]
*  They say don't run, right? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=657.0s)]
*  Don't turn your back. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=658.0s)]
*  You're supposed to pretend like you're a bear. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=659.0s)]
*  There's no such thing. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=660.0s)]
*  Oh, that shit's bullshit. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=661.0s)]
*  It depends. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=662.0s)]
*  It depends on why it's attacking you. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=663.0s)]
*  It depends on if it's a mother with cubs, just wants to neutralize a threat. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=665.0s)]
*  Or if it's predatory. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=668.0s)]
*  And with black bears, they're more likely to be predatory than grizzly bears are with people. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=670.0s)]
*  Most of the attacks on grizzly bears and people, it's a surprise thing. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=675.0s)]
*  Or a mother with a cub. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=679.0s)]
*  Or occasionally an old male just having a hard time catching deer and elk, so just decides to start fucking you up. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=681.0s)]
*  But black bears are, for whatever reason, they've killed quite a few people. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=687.0s)]
*  It's not as many as like car accidents and heart attacks. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=692.0s)]
*  But it could. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=695.0s)]
*  It could get high. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=697.0s)]
*  It all depends on, if you let them grow where they're everywhere like coyotes are, you've got a real fucking problem. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=699.0s)]
*  Not that it could, but I'm saying, if that happened. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=704.0s)]
*  Alright, I'm getting bear spray. That's it. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=707.0s)]
*  Even bear spray doesn't necessarily work. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=709.0s)]
*  So shit, what takes these things down? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=712.0s)]
*  Bullets. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=715.0s)]
*  It's almost like you need to scare them off with a gun or shoot them, depending upon what's happening. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=716.0s)]
*  But it's fucking terrifying that people anthropomorphize those things and turn them into like teddy bears and yogi bear and this and that. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=721.0s)]
*  And if you kill one and eat it, people will absolutely get furious at you. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=729.0s)]
*  But I'm here to tell you, I've done it and they taste good. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=733.0s)]
*  They taste good and we should probably do more of it. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=735.0s)]
*  They're out there. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=738.0s)]
*  You need them too. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=740.0s)]
*  They're a part of the ecosystem. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=742.0s)]
*  You need them to manage the populations of undulates. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=743.0s)]
*  So they'll eat all the calves. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=745.0s)]
*  Do they eat deer? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=747.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah. They eat babies. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=748.0s)]
*  Because there's too many deer. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=749.0s)]
*  They mostly, I mean, they have incredible sense of smell. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=751.0s)]
*  And so they can smell when a female's given birth. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=757.0s)]
*  So if they're anywhere downwind of a female given birth, they're going to find that baby and they're going to go eat it. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=760.0s)]
*  They eat something like 50% of all like elk calves and deer fawns. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=765.0s)]
*  50% of them get eaten by bears. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=772.0s)]
*  I always wonder about that because the deer fawns, the mother just leaves the fawn, right? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=774.0s)]
*  In the grass sometimes. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=779.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=781.0s)]
*  And somehow it's like, doesn't have a scent on it yet or something. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=782.0s)]
*  I don't know what that is. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=785.0s)]
*  I mean, how could it not have a scent? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=787.0s)]
*  I saw one once just like chilling by itself and we went and we petted it. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=789.0s)]
*  And we were like, is it dead? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=792.0s)]
*  Because I didn't know that that's what deer's did. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=793.0s)]
*  And then eventually it ran off. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=795.0s)]
*  After I petted it again, it ran off. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=797.0s)]
*  But it was by itself just kind of laying under a tree. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=800.0s)]
*  Yeah, when they're really, really, really young, they just stay put. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=802.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=805.0s)]
*  Which is very vulnerable. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=806.0s)]
*  Maybe it's because like they figured out like the mother can't really watch them and get food. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=808.0s)]
*  But how's the mother even getting food? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=813.0s)]
*  Does she give? Is it just milk? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=815.0s)]
*  I guess it's just milk when they're that young. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=817.0s)]
*  And then I wonder how long afterwards they can start eating grass. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=819.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=822.0s)]
*  But they walk right away, which is crazy. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=823.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=825.0s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=826.0s)]
*  We're the only animal that comes out just fucking useless for two years. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=827.0s)]
*  We are so useless, probably more than two years, probably two years back in the day where things were rougher. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=831.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=836.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=837.0s)]
*  A two-year-old dog can protect your house. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=838.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=839.0s)]
*  Two-year-old dogs like 45 years old in man years. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=840.0s)]
*  He's ready. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=842.0s)]
*  Yeah, two-year-old dogs are big dogs. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=844.0s)]
*  They're fully grown. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=846.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=847.0s)]
*  My dog was probably like at five months, he was probably like 50, 60 pounds. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=848.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=852.0s)]
*  They're more ready to deal with the harshness of reality. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=853.0s)]
*  Not my dog. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=858.0s)]
*  My dog's not dealing with any harshness. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=859.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know, but if you turned your dog, if you turned Marshall into a working dog, like if it was bred to be aware, it's ready. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=861.0s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you what he is. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=867.0s)]
*  He's the enemy of all squirrels. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=868.0s)]
*  That motherfucker loves squirrels. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=870.0s)]
*  Oh, he's got it out for squirrels. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=871.0s)]
*  He's got it out for squirrels. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=872.0s)]
*  That's his number one hobby, is hunting squirrels. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=873.0s)]
*  It's crazy because it's like, other than that, he's the sweetest dog of all time. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=876.0s)]
*  But with squirrels, he's the boogeyman. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=880.0s)]
*  He's a murderer. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=883.0s)]
*  He's just kind of soft. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=884.0s)]
*  You know, he's a big fluffy guy. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=886.0s)]
*  So he's not like he's not like a fucking raptor. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=888.0s)]
*  Like he's really clever about how he approaches it. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=890.0s)]
*  But he catches them slipping. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=892.0s)]
*  Yeah, he catches them slipping. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=894.0s)]
*  He's caught quite a few slipping. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=896.0s)]
*  It's cool when you see like a sweet dog and then that instinct comes out, that killer wolf instinct comes out around squirrels. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=897.0s)]
*  They're just and then they see a fucking squirrel and they lock in and they just want to murder my dog. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=903.0s)]
*  My dog did that to a skunk recently. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=909.0s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=912.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=913.0s)]
*  It's my first brush with that. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=914.0s)]
*  It is brutal. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=915.0s)]
*  That happened to me when I was 13. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=917.0s)]
*  Dude, skunks are effective. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=919.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=921.0s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=922.0s)]
*  We had to get a tomato juice. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=923.0s)]
*  This is like when I was 13 when we had a dog that got attacked by a skunk. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=924.0s)]
*  This is 79 or 80 or something like that. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=929.0s)]
*  I guess it was 1980. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=933.0s)]
*  So no one knew. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=934.0s)]
*  There was no fucking solvents. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=935.0s)]
*  You could buy the pet store to clean that shit off. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=936.0s)]
*  You use tomato juice. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=938.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't even think any of that stuff works, too. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=940.0s)]
*  I mean, this happened like a couple of months ago. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=942.0s)]
*  My dog still smells like a homeless person. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=944.0s)]
*  It's like a homeless person sleeping in my house. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=946.0s)]
*  It's so crazy how effective that smell is. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=948.0s)]
*  It was so funny to watch, too, because I saw my dog see the skunk. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=951.0s)]
*  And my dog's sweet, too. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=955.0s)]
*  She's so sweet. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=956.0s)]
*  She saw the skunk. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=957.0s)]
*  And I could see in her mind she was going like, oh, it's just like a tiny little squirrel. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=958.0s)]
*  I'm about to fuck this shit up. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=962.0s)]
*  So she lunges at it. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=964.0s)]
*  And skunks are badass, dude. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=966.0s)]
*  They're like the NRA, like, gun carrying Republicans of the animal kingdom. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=968.0s)]
*  Because my dog's ready to fucking do jujitsu, fuck it up. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=975.0s)]
*  And that skunk just went, I wouldn't do that if I was you. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=978.0s)]
*  I'm strapped. You know what I mean? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=981.0s)]
*  My dog lunges, and the skunk just turns around and fucking laser beam diarrhea shot right in the face. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=982.0s)]
*  You were there for the whole thing? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=989.0s)]
*  I saw the whole thing. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=991.0s)]
*  Dude, they're the only animal that's strapped. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=992.0s)]
*  They got a gun. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=995.0s)]
*  True. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=996.0s)]
*  And it's effective. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=997.0s)]
*  They got bear spray. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=998.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I read like less than 4% or 5% of skunks get killed by predators. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=999.0s)]
*  It's like it's a really effective defense mechanism. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1003.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1005.0s)]
*  Yeah. And they're tiny. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1006.0s)]
*  And then the skunk, after he sprayed the dog, he just kind of walked away like business as usual. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1007.0s)]
*  Another motherfucker stepped up and found out. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1012.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1017.0s)]
*  When I was a kid, I had a cat that looked like the raccoon. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1018.0s)]
*  And we were convinced that the dog probably thought that that raccoon or rather the skunk was my cat. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1022.0s)]
*  Because we had a biting black cat. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1029.0s)]
*  It was like real close to skunk looking. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1031.0s)]
*  It was a very fluffy cat. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1033.0s)]
*  Yeah. Did he attack? Did he stay away from it? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1034.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. I think that's... I was dumb. I was 13. I didn't know anything about animals. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1037.0s)]
*  He probably knew it was a skunk or knew it was something other than his cat that he lived with. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1042.0s)]
*  I thought maybe he came up to like, hey, what's up? And it just gets a blast in the face. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1047.0s)]
*  What the fuck? You're not Tony. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1051.0s)]
*  The smell is so potent up close. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1054.0s)]
*  You know what they say it's like? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1057.0s)]
*  It's like, you know how a bloodhound can track a person with just like a little bit of clothing? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1058.0s)]
*  You know, they're using their ears and shit and all the jowls. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1063.0s)]
*  The reason why all that stuff is floppy is because it kicks up smell. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1066.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1070.0s)]
*  You know how like disgusting people fart and then they go like that and smell? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1071.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1074.0s)]
*  Taking good with their farts. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1075.0s)]
*  Well, that's wafting up smell. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1077.0s)]
*  Well, that's what that bloodhound's doing when it's running. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1079.0s)]
*  Because they're running and the ears are flopping and all the lips are all that shit is moving around [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1082.0s)]
*  and it's sending that smell to this super powerful nose. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1087.0s)]
*  Well, the way they smell stuff is kind of the way it's similar in like the ability to detect it. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1091.0s)]
*  Like we smell skunk. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1097.0s)]
*  That's so interesting. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1098.0s)]
*  Because you know, skunk can blast someone a couple of blocks away. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1099.0s)]
*  And you're driving home in your fucking car. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1103.0s)]
*  And you're like, wow, somebody got a skunk. Oh, Jesus. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1106.0s)]
*  But it could be pretty far away from you. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1109.0s)]
*  It doesn't have to be like right there. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1111.0s)]
*  Yeah. And the wind takes it kind of just pull it. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1113.0s)]
*  Apparently that's what it's like to be a bloodhound. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1115.0s)]
*  What the fuck is that? Where is that bitch? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1117.0s)]
*  Where the fuck is he? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1119.0s)]
*  Now, a bear's nose is something in the range of, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1120.0s)]
*  see how much stronger a bear's nose is than a bloodhound? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1124.0s)]
*  Because I don't want to overstate this. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1127.0s)]
*  But I think it's like 900 percent. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1129.0s)]
*  More than? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1132.0s)]
*  900 percent more powerful. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1133.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1134.0s)]
*  Something crazy like nine times more powerful. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1135.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1137.0s)]
*  I might have exaggerated. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1138.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1139.0s)]
*  We'll find out with the actual number. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1140.0s)]
*  Seven. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1142.0s)]
*  Seven times. I exaggerated. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1143.0s)]
*  That's seven times more than a bloodhound. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1144.0s)]
*  They use bloodhounds to find fucking people to just smell their shoes [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1146.0s)]
*  and catch them running through the woods. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1150.0s)]
*  Well, if you think about a dog has what? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1152.0s)]
*  Like nine million more smell receptors in their nose or something. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1154.0s)]
*  So if you think about it that way, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1159.0s)]
*  then a bear seven times more than that. That's insane. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1160.0s)]
*  Not even just a regular hound. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1162.0s)]
*  A bloodhound is designed for that. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1164.0s)]
*  So a bear has 2,100 times better smell than a human. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1166.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1172.0s)]
*  Yeah, they could sniff lunch yesterday on you. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1174.0s)]
*  They probably can pick out the pickles. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1177.0s)]
*  They can smell the pickle in the barrel. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1179.0s)]
*  Oh, there's pickles in that barrel. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1182.0s)]
*  This is a sandwich. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1183.0s)]
*  Somebody left a Chick-fil-A in that fucking barrel. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1184.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's insane. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1186.0s)]
*  When you think about how smart we are, we're pretty smart. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1187.0s)]
*  But you could say that they're equally as smart in another way. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1190.0s)]
*  To be able to smell like that is like a superpower. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1197.0s)]
*  It's a superpower. It's definitely not smart. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1200.0s)]
*  But one of the things that's happened is as we've gotten smarter, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1202.0s)]
*  we've had less need for senses. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1204.0s)]
*  So our senses now like, I'm fucking so bad at knowing how to get places. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1206.0s)]
*  And I've been here for two years because I'm always relying on my phone. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1211.0s)]
*  Why would I fucking pay attention? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1215.0s)]
*  I got other shit to pay attention to. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1217.0s)]
*  I'm busy. Tell me how to get to Terry Black. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1218.0s)]
*  Poink, poke it in there, and it just tells me where to go. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1221.0s)]
*  Because of that, I've sort of like opted off that sense of direction to a machine. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1223.0s)]
*  I don't know anyone's number anymore. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1229.0s)]
*  Do you? Do you know anyone's number? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1231.0s)]
*  I don't even know my wife's number. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1232.0s)]
*  I know my wife's and maybe, oh, Eddie Bravo's. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1233.0s)]
*  I got Eddie Bravo's memorized. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1236.0s)]
*  That's it. That's all I know. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1238.0s)]
*  Everybody else is like, I got to look at my phone. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1239.0s)]
*  We've opted off our memory to it. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1241.0s)]
*  And we've opted off all of our other senses to civilization. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1244.0s)]
*  You know, you don't need to smell everything if you're living in a fucking house. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1248.0s)]
*  You're pretty protected. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1251.0s)]
*  You know, oh, you got guns now? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1253.0s)]
*  You barely need a sixth sense. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1255.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1258.0s)]
*  Yeah, nothing is sneaking up behind you when you're walking through the fucking woods with a bunch of guys with guns. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1259.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1263.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1264.0s)]
*  We're totally detached. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1265.0s)]
*  Yeah, but there's probably some atrophy and just natural detection and senses. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1266.0s)]
*  Do you think we used to be able to smell better before all this stuff? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1270.0s)]
*  100%. 100. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1273.0s)]
*  I think every biologist would probably agree that we lost some senses. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1276.0s)]
*  And we certainly lost like physical strength and hair all over our bodies to protect us from the elements. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1281.0s)]
*  Why? Because we invented clothes. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1286.0s)]
*  Clothes are better. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1287.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1288.0s)]
*  So once you get covered up in clothes, you don't fucking need them. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1289.0s)]
*  Yeah. And smell probably was super important back then, right? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1291.0s)]
*  Because like you'd be able to smell rotten meat or bacteria and things. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1294.0s)]
*  Sure. And you'd also be able to smell animals. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1299.0s)]
*  Like when you go elk hunting and you're walking through the woods, you smell elk beds. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1301.0s)]
*  You smell them. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1305.0s)]
*  Like guys will turn and look at each other and go, smell that, smell that. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1306.0s)]
*  And you can smell like this wafty smell of elk. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1308.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1311.0s)]
*  Like they have a very specific smell. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1312.0s)]
*  And that's just a bitch ass nose like mine, right? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1314.0s)]
*  You know, useless fucking nose. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1316.0s)]
*  Yeah. Maybe there's a way to strengthen it. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1318.0s)]
*  Like take it to the nose gym and just like do like sniffle lifts. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1321.0s)]
*  You got to imagine those guys like the wine guys, what are they called again? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1325.0s)]
*  Summoyes. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1331.0s)]
*  Summoyes. So Summoyes. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1332.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1333.0s)]
*  Like they have a sense of smell that's probably far superior. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1334.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1336.0s)]
*  Right? They're smelling the oaks and the tannins and they're smelling the vintage. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1337.0s)]
*  Like that's part of their gig is they smell it, right? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1340.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So they train it. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1342.0s)]
*  They probably that's like they train it to get good. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1345.0s)]
*  They have a- [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1347.0s)]
*  Has to be. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1348.0s)]
*  Yeah. Or they're just lying or they're just going doing it for show and going like- [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1349.0s)]
*  People have educated ears, right? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1353.0s)]
*  Like people like music composers, they have educated ears. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1355.0s)]
*  Like they're hearing things that probably you or I, do you play any musical instrument? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1359.0s)]
*  No, I played piano when I was little. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1362.0s)]
*  I don't play shit. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1364.0s)]
*  So I don't know what the fuck's going on. I just enjoy it. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1365.0s)]
*  So for me, I'm uneducated ear. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1367.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1369.0s)]
*  I'm just listening, but they're listening in terms of like they understand where the music is going and where the beats are. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1370.0s)]
*  And like they could see it. If it was written out on paper, they could read music on paper. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1375.0s)]
*  Right. And do you think you could train it though to get stronger? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1380.0s)]
*  More aware for sure because you have more information, right? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1385.0s)]
*  But like so you can hear things that are farther away or less lower in volume? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1388.0s)]
*  No wonder. Probably not. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1395.0s)]
*  I think it's probably an evolutionary thing. It's probably an overtime. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1398.0s)]
*  The organ just got less powerful, but I bet the organs vary. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1402.0s)]
*  Like Cam Haynes and I are the same age, but that motherfucker's vision is so much better than mine. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1406.0s)]
*  My vision sucks. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1411.0s)]
*  Like if I'm looking at my phone now, I got to like fucking get squirrely with it in the morning. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1413.0s)]
*  I don't even I put reading glasses on. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1418.0s)]
*  I don't even bother trying to read the email on my fucking phone with no glasses and screw something up. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1420.0s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1425.0s)]
*  You know, it's very black, but Cam has no problem. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1426.0s)]
*  Who's Cam? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1428.0s)]
*  Cam Haynes, my buddy, same age as me. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1429.0s)]
*  So he has zero problem with his eyes. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1431.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1433.0s)]
*  It's very disturbing to me. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1434.0s)]
*  But that's the thing is like organs are better on some people. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1435.0s)]
*  It's just like some people have bigger dicks. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1438.0s)]
*  Some people have better brains. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1440.0s)]
*  These are real things. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1441.0s)]
*  You know, and some people can hear better. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1443.0s)]
*  They just have better hearing. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1444.0s)]
*  You know that some people have better eyesight. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1446.0s)]
*  I'm sure people have a better sense of smell. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1448.0s)]
*  You don't think Ari's sense of smell is better than yours? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1450.0s)]
*  You're out of your fucking mind. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1452.0s)]
*  You're out of your mind. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1455.0s)]
*  If you want to fucking have a smell off with Ari Shaffir, that dude has a massive advantage on you. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1456.0s)]
*  He's got a snout. Yeah. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1463.0s)]
*  Bit that he doesn't do special about doing coke. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1465.0s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1467.0s)]
*  Oh my God, it's so funny. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1469.0s)]
*  His special was so good. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1470.0s)]
*  It was, it really was, I think it made me think at least like, damn, I want to step it up for the next one. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1473.0s)]
*  I may maybe have it be about a theme or at least make the production look as good as he did. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1480.0s)]
*  I just had him on my podcast and he was telling me about how he really put a lot of money and effort into the set [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1485.0s)]
*  and even the lighting around the theater. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1491.0s)]
*  It looked so good. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1494.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1495.0s)]
*  And he'd been working on it for five years and it showed, man. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1496.0s)]
*  It was really refreshing. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1499.0s)]
*  The timing couldn't have been better. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1500.0s)]
*  I mean, the Kanye basically was his PR. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1502.0s)]
*  It's amazing. The timing's amazing. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1504.0s)]
*  It was so perfect. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1506.0s)]
*  The time, it's like the universe threw him a bone. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1507.0s)]
*  That's really what it was. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1509.0s)]
*  Like, Ari, you've been a good guy. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1510.0s)]
*  The universe is throwing you a bone now. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1511.0s)]
*  And he did the work. He did it the right way. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1513.0s)]
*  He worked on it for a long time. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1515.0s)]
*  I got a chance to see it here at the Creek in the Cave in Austin. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1517.0s)]
*  And I'd seen it before a couple years back and it was way better now. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1520.0s)]
*  It was just really tight and he seemed playful with it. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1523.0s)]
*  And he's had such an amazing life. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1526.0s)]
*  I mean, that guy was basically a super religious, I guess he's orthodox. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1528.0s)]
*  What was he? Orthodox Jew? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1533.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was an orthodox Jew, yeah. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1534.0s)]
*  And quit to fuck this. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1536.0s)]
*  But he has this experience to draw upon and convert to comedy that's different than anybody's. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1538.0s)]
*  So when he talks about it, it's not like you or I making a joke about something crazy that's in the Torah. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1545.0s)]
*  Like, he grew up on it. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1550.0s)]
*  He knows it. He's an expert in it. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1553.0s)]
*  And he's a legit professional stand-up comic. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1556.0s)]
*  And he's a legit professional Jew. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1560.0s)]
*  I mean, he's Jewish all the way. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1562.0s)]
*  From soup to nuts. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1564.0s)]
*  It also did that thing I think that comedy does best where it like, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1565.0s)]
*  it brought everyone together by exposing all these kind of strange things that we consider strange now in the modern world [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1570.0s)]
*  and saying like, hey man, you have that too in your religion. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1578.0s)]
*  And so it made you think of the stuff that was similar to those weird things in your religion. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1582.0s)]
*  I know I felt that way. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1589.0s)]
*  I was thinking about Greek Orthodox Church and all the strange things they make you do. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1590.0s)]
*  And you're like, yeah, we're all the same. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1594.0s)]
*  We just have different superstitions and beliefs. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1596.0s)]
*  You know what religion is like? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1599.0s)]
*  It's like when Congress signs a bill. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1600.0s)]
*  And how much did you read of that bill? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1602.0s)]
*  There's a 3,000 page bill. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1604.0s)]
*  You got it 48 hours ago. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1606.0s)]
*  What the fuck are you signing? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1608.0s)]
*  So there's probably a lot of shit in that bill that you don't agree with. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1610.0s)]
*  But the bill, overall, the tone of the bill is going to do some good in the community. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1612.0s)]
*  So you're willing to go along with it. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1618.0s)]
*  That's what it's like. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1620.0s)]
*  That's what the Bible is like. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1621.0s)]
*  That's what the Torah is like. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1623.0s)]
*  That's what all these religions are like. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1624.0s)]
*  They're like a big ass congressional bill that nobody ever read through all the way. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1626.0s)]
*  But you agree with it because the tribe agrees with it. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1630.0s)]
*  This is better for the community. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1632.0s)]
*  This is better for our people. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1634.0s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1635.0s)]
*  I think that's great about it. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1636.0s)]
*  It's kind of exactly like that. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1638.0s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1639.0s)]
*  It's the same fucking shit. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1640.0s)]
*  That's why those patterns exist in cults. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1641.0s)]
*  Those patterns exist in religions and in government. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1644.0s)]
*  It's groups of people that have extraordinary power and they get to a position and they control people and they control people with an ideology. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1648.0s)]
*  Whether that ideology is political or it's a democratic party or whether it's religious or it's the Catholic Church. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1657.0s)]
*  It's the same kind of thing. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1663.0s)]
*  It just happens kind of every time human beings get in a big group of people together. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1665.0s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1669.0s)]
*  What is it in human nature that makes us prone to that? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1670.0s)]
*  We get bored. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1676.0s)]
*  You think that's what it is? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1677.0s)]
*  We get bored and we want to take over a flock and start fucking everybody's wife. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1678.0s)]
*  Give me all the money. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1682.0s)]
*  We get bored. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1683.0s)]
*  What else is he supposed to do? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1685.0s)]
*  He's got his own cult. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1686.0s)]
*  Well, everybody's listening to me now. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1687.0s)]
*  Well, how far can I take this? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1689.0s)]
*  I'm going to start banging people's wives. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1691.0s)]
*  They always go there, man. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1693.0s)]
*  It's like the natural progression. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1694.0s)]
*  The caterpillar becomes the butterfly. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1696.0s)]
*  The fucking cult leader, he bangs everybody's wife. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1698.0s)]
*  Dude, when I was flying in Austin this time, I was watching a Nick stuff. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1701.0s)]
*  What is it called again, Jamie? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1707.0s)]
*  The Albany cult? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1708.0s)]
*  Nixxiom. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1710.0s)]
*  I was watching the documentary on that. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1711.0s)]
*  And so when I got off the plane, I was watching my phone and I saw my buddy, Matteo Lane. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1714.0s)]
*  He's a really funny comic and he's gay. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1718.0s)]
*  And so my head was blown. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1720.0s)]
*  So I just started talking about it immediately. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1723.0s)]
*  I'm like this dude, because what he was doing, he was fucking all these girls and he was branding them. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1724.0s)]
*  He was branding them right by their vaginas. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1728.0s)]
*  And I was talking to him and he just goes, Matteo Lane goes, it made me laugh so hard. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1730.0s)]
*  He goes, Jesus, what straight guys have to go through just to fucking get laid? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1734.0s)]
*  You got to start a cult. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1739.0s)]
*  You have to like go through all this manipulation just to get some pussy. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1741.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1745.0s)]
*  Gay guys just throw their abs on a dating site and they're just like, let's fuck. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1747.0s)]
*  Bam, inundated. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1750.0s)]
*  I wonder how they get anything done. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1751.0s)]
*  I have a buddy of mine, he's a good looking guy and he's on the dating apps and he fucking can't get anything done. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1753.0s)]
*  And he told me he's swearing off the apps now. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1758.0s)]
*  But when we were talking about it, Will Harris, sorry Will. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1760.0s)]
*  He talked about it on the podcast though, right? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1766.0s)]
*  He did, right? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1768.0s)]
*  Will's this big, tall, handsome guy and he's successful and everywhere he goes, that fucking thing's blowing up. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1769.0s)]
*  If you're on those apps, you're not going to get anything done. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1777.0s)]
*  You're not going to be able to think straight. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1780.0s)]
*  You're not going to be able to get a relationship, like a real relationship. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1782.0s)]
*  How are you going to do that? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1785.0s)]
*  How are you going to do that? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1786.0s)]
*  Unless you're really playing musical chairs. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1787.0s)]
*  And when that music stops, you got a chair and you're going to stay in that chair. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1790.0s)]
*  You're not getting back on that app. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1793.0s)]
*  You don't even get a check. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1795.0s)]
*  Like someone will say something sarcastic in a text, like what the fuck does that mean? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1796.0s)]
*  Fuck her, I'm going to check the app. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1800.0s)]
*  And then you swipe and right or what is it? Left or right? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1802.0s)]
*  Whatever it is. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1805.0s)]
*  You're giving them a star, a thumbs up. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1806.0s)]
*  Whatever the fuck you have to do. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1808.0s)]
*  Swipe right or swipe left on Tinder. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1809.0s)]
*  What they're doing is it's like you have too much access. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1811.0s)]
*  They've taken away the challenge or the hunt of anything. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1816.0s)]
*  It's a fuckfest. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1820.0s)]
*  It's a wild fuckfest. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1821.0s)]
*  You can basically order pussy to your house like food delivery. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1822.0s)]
*  Yeah, or dick. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1826.0s)]
*  Whatever you want. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1827.0s)]
*  Yeah, whatever it is. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1828.0s)]
*  The dick comes easier. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1829.0s)]
*  Quicker too. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1830.0s)]
*  How long before people are doing it virtually? [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1831.0s)]
*  How long before when they develop haptic feedback suits and fucking neural links and put on VR goggles, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1833.0s)]
*  people are just going to fuck random strangers virtually. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1840.0s)]
*  It won't even count. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1843.0s)]
*  Yeah, I actually thought about this. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1844.0s)]
*  I used to always want a quick death. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1846.0s)]
*  I used to say, dude, I just want a quick death. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1849.0s)]
*  But then I started thinking, if I have a quick death, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1853.0s)]
*  then I'm only going to be able to think of one person and be like, oh, I'm going to miss that person. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1856.0s)]
*  I love that person because it's so quick. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1861.0s)]
*  But now I want a long, drawn out death because of the metaverse. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1863.0s)]
*  Because you could have cancer and be incapacitated, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1867.0s)]
*  but you could just go in the metaverse and be walking and fucking. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1869.0s)]
*  There's got to be some pleasure in living mentally in the metaverse, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1873.0s)]
*  even though you're dying of some terminal disease. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1878.0s)]
*  Once something comes up. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1881.0s)]
*  I'm going to keep you alive. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1882.0s)]
*  I'm in the metaverse. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1883.0s)]
*  I've got a girlfriend. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1884.0s)]
*  I've got a house. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1885.0s)]
*  I've got a wife. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1886.0s)]
*  Maybe it'll keep you alive anyway. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1887.0s)]
*  Maybe if you're really hooked up to a thing, it'll just keep your consciousness alive. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1888.0s)]
*  It'll keep your body alive electronically. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1890.0s)]
*  That's totally possible. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1893.0s)]
*  I mean, they do that kind of with respirators. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1894.0s)]
*  And when they use those heart pumps on people, when they're having a heart surgery, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1896.0s)]
*  they take your fucking heart out. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1900.0s)]
*  Yeah. And you're still alive. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1901.0s)]
*  Yeah. And they put a new one in there and then they reconnect everything, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1902.0s)]
*  which is fucking wild. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1905.0s)]
*  That is wild. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1907.0s)]
*  It is fucking wild. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1908.0s)]
*  They can do it, right? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1909.0s)]
*  Oh, they do it. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1910.0s)]
*  And they get something that just keeps your heart beating. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1911.0s)]
*  They can keep your heart beating. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1913.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then just put your consciousness. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1914.0s)]
*  My friend C.T. Fletcher's got someone else's heart in his chest. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1916.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1920.0s)]
*  He came on before the podcast and after the podcast. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1921.0s)]
*  And he thinks it's a woman. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1923.0s)]
*  He thinks it's a woman. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1925.0s)]
*  They don't tell you who it is. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1926.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1927.0s)]
*  He has a feeling that it's an Asian woman. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1928.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1930.0s)]
*  Yeah, just randomly, I think. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1931.0s)]
*  Did he like? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1932.0s)]
*  He said that, right? [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1933.0s)]
*  I'm not out of school with that. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1934.0s)]
*  Did he find himself going and putting a jab application in at a massage place? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1935.0s)]
*  Oh, you son of a bitch. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1939.0s)]
*  It's like it must be an Asian woman. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1941.0s)]
*  You son of a bitch. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1942.0s)]
*  You know, it's interesting when people go through something like that too, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1943.0s)]
*  because then they become very, very compassionate [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1947.0s)]
*  and very, very aware that they've been given a new lease on life. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1949.0s)]
*  And, you know, and then you're also like deeply connected to this family [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1953.0s)]
*  of the people of the person who died and donated their heart. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1957.0s)]
*  And that's keeping you alive. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1960.0s)]
*  And you're you can meet these people like you have a part of their loved one [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1961.0s)]
*  inside of you, which is pretty wild. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1966.0s)]
*  That is so well to think about. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1969.0s)]
*  Why do they can do that? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1970.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1971.0s)]
*  And they're going to be able to 3D print them, man. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1972.0s)]
*  That's going to be the future. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1975.0s)]
*  They're going to be able to 3D print hearts and organs and liver and kidneys. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1976.0s)]
*  They've already started doing shit like that. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1981.0s)]
*  That's going to be wild. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1983.0s)]
*  Would you like I don't even know if I'd want to continue to live past like a bitch. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1984.0s)]
*  You're going to keep going. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1988.0s)]
*  Keep going. Right. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1989.0s)]
*  You're going to keep going. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1990.0s)]
*  Why not? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1991.0s)]
*  They could turn you into Thor. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1992.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1993.0s)]
*  But don't you think it would get trite? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1994.0s)]
*  Everything would kind of just get trite like. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1995.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1997.0s)]
*  It's going to suck. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1998.0s)]
*  Yeah. But it's going to happen. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=1999.0s)]
*  It's going to happen. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2001.0s)]
*  There'll be no more Bobby Kelly's. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2002.0s)]
*  They won't exist anymore. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2003.0s)]
*  Everyone's going to be perfect. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2004.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2005.0s)]
*  Not that Bobby is not perfect. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2006.0s)]
*  But the perfect, the flawed perfection. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2007.0s)]
*  You mean his look. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2010.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2011.0s)]
*  But the flawed perfection is one of the beautiful things of life. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2012.0s)]
*  And that's what we're going to miss. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2014.0s)]
*  You're not going to get your Joey Diaz's. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2015.0s)]
*  You're not going to get your Patrice O'Neill's or your Louis C.K.'s. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2017.0s)]
*  You're not going to get any like really weird people that had to go through a strange childhood [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2020.0s)]
*  to develop the personality that they have now, which everybody loves so much. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2026.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2030.0s)]
*  Like all the crazy people that we know. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2031.0s)]
*  They all had like some very unideal childhood. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2032.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2036.0s)]
*  Maybe that's the if there's simulators or a god or whatever, maybe that's the whole point of this was for humanity to evolve all the way up to get to that point where we can achieve perfection. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2037.0s)]
*  And then they just pulled the plug. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2046.0s)]
*  And that's that's how they because they always they always win. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2047.0s)]
*  I mean, nature always wins one way or the other. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2050.0s)]
*  Nature wins. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2052.0s)]
*  Right. But universes also exist. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2053.0s)]
*  Right. So like black holes exist. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2056.0s)]
*  Quasars exist. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2060.0s)]
*  Comets exist. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2062.0s)]
*  All this stuff exists. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2063.0s)]
*  So how does it how did it get to the point where things evolve to the point where human beings have cell phones, human beings have electric cars, human beings have like we were animals in the forest. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2064.0s)]
*  And now we have nuclear bombs like we're that far along. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2075.0s)]
*  The idea that it stops right there is crazy. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2078.0s)]
*  I think we just keep integrating with technology and eventually we become like a god. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2081.0s)]
*  I think whether it's a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand years from now, I think of the human being stays alive, the species stays alive and nothing happens that resets us back into the fucking dark ages again. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2086.0s)]
*  We get to a technological point. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2097.0s)]
*  We control everything in the universe. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2099.0s)]
*  I think that's what a god is. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2101.0s)]
*  I think that's what happens to intelligent life when it gets to this ultimate state of technological achievement and control over its environment. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2103.0s)]
*  That's probably what the universe made us for. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2112.0s)]
*  So we're like little little fucking salmon spry. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2115.0s)]
*  What are they called fry? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2119.0s)]
*  Little little fuckers going up the river not even exactly sure what they're doing. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2120.0s)]
*  But the universe has a plan for us to feed a bear to feed a bear. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2124.0s)]
*  Don't yet. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2133.0s)]
*  I mean the universe has a plan for everything. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2134.0s)]
*  I think there's there's like a legitimate pathway. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2136.0s)]
*  I mean obviously that plan can get fucked up. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2138.0s)]
*  But then it restarts. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2140.0s)]
*  The universe doesn't give a fuck about time. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2142.0s)]
*  If the whole earth explodes like if our earth gets hit with another planet like it did in the past. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2144.0s)]
*  It used to be Earth one and then Earth one was hit by another planet which created the moon. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2151.0s)]
*  That's a leading theory. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2157.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2158.0s)]
*  Isn't that just a is that a theory or do they know that that's real? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2159.0s)]
*  Just roll with it. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2164.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2165.0s)]
*  But I think that's definitely a theory. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2166.0s)]
*  But the point is that we got hit by a fucking planet. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2167.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2170.0s)]
*  And then everything sort of just got obliterated. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2171.0s)]
*  Life slowly evolved and came out of that and became what we are now. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2176.0s)]
*  This what we are survived getting hit by a planet. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2180.0s)]
*  It just wouldn't do it in 100 years. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2184.0s)]
*  Our problems were fucked because our timeline so little. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2186.0s)]
*  This little baby timeline little blinky blinky 100 years in terms of the universe. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2189.0s)]
*  That's a nothing. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2193.0s)]
*  The universe is fine with restarting civilization back to cave people. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2195.0s)]
*  And then having them figuring out again. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2199.0s)]
*  They don't give a shit. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2201.0s)]
*  But maybe it's just part of the plan that we end and then and then like rats and roaches get to evolve. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2202.0s)]
*  That could happen too. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2208.0s)]
*  And go to like rat and roaches cafes. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2209.0s)]
*  And well that's a good question. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2211.0s)]
*  Like why didn't the fucking go put that back up again. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2212.0s)]
*  Why didn't dinosaurs evolve collision with lost second satellite would explain moons asymmetry. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2214.0s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2220.0s)]
*  So Earth may have had two moons. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2221.0s)]
*  Earth once had two moons with merged into a slow motion collision that took several hours to complete. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2223.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2229.0s)]
*  Imagine seeing that. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2230.0s)]
*  Imagine looking up in the sky and two moons collided with each other and are merging. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2232.0s)]
*  Holy fuck. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2237.0s)]
*  Both satellites would have formed from debris that was ejected when a Mars sized protoplanet smacked into Earth late in its formation period. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2239.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2247.0s)]
*  That's what I was talking about. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2248.0s)]
*  Whereas traditional theory states that the infant moon rapidly swept up any rivals or gravitationally ejected them into the interstellar space. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2249.0s)]
*  The new theory suggests that one body survived parked in a gravitationally stable point in the Earth moon system. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2258.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2264.0s)]
*  So we got the Earth got a stocked and smacked to make it. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2266.0s)]
*  That's more like a Francis and Gano left hook. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2270.0s)]
*  We get hit by a planet. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2273.0s)]
*  That's a real problem. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2276.0s)]
*  But that could happen again. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2278.0s)]
*  And if that happens again the universe doesn't care. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2279.0s)]
*  We just care because our timeline is so little. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2282.0s)]
*  So we're like frantic and anxious because we have so little time and we realize in the greater scope of everything it's not that important. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2284.0s)]
*  It's only important to you and it's important to people who love you. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2293.0s)]
*  It might even be important to communities and might be important to civilization. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2296.0s)]
*  At the end of the day if you keep going that fucking Alpha Centauri doesn't give a fuck if you make it or not. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2300.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2305.0s)]
*  It doesn't give a fuck if you're late for work if you're stuck in traffic. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2306.0s)]
*  It doesn't care if you have a flat tire. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2309.0s)]
*  It doesn't care if you get cancer. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2311.0s)]
*  It doesn't care. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2312.0s)]
*  We just want to keep it going because now we're aware of it. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2313.0s)]
*  Because we have a goal. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2315.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2317.0s)]
*  We're trying to become the next thing. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2318.0s)]
*  And we have it good. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2320.0s)]
*  Like things are good now. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2321.0s)]
*  Pretty nice. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2322.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2323.0s)]
*  Like if my life was horrible I wouldn't care as much. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2324.0s)]
*  You know now that I have kids I care more. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2326.0s)]
*  Like I always wonder like a guy like John Stamos. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2328.0s)]
*  Him dying is probably going to be harder than me dying. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2331.0s)]
*  Because like you're just not going to want to stop being John Stamos. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2334.0s)]
*  It's a good spot. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2338.0s)]
*  He's going to go to heaven and be like it's not that great. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2339.0s)]
*  It was pretty fucking I just had it. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2342.0s)]
*  He had a good spot. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2344.0s)]
*  Yeah he had a good spot. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2345.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2346.0s)]
*  He just was genetically gifted, musically talented, great actor. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2347.0s)]
*  And then he goes to heaven. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2350.0s)]
*  Greek. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2351.0s)]
*  Yeah now he's like I'm just walking down the beach with Jesus. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2352.0s)]
*  This is kind of a downgrade from where I was. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2353.0s)]
*  I think we're all going to become a new thing. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2356.0s)]
*  I really do. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2360.0s)]
*  I think it's probably going to happen inside our lifetime. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2361.0s)]
*  So you think we'll be able to survive the next right hook from like a asteroid? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2363.0s)]
*  Maybe not. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2369.0s)]
*  We might not. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2370.0s)]
*  I mean that's what that whole Graham Hancock series that's on Netflix right now called [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2371.0s)]
*  Ancient Catastrophe. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2375.0s)]
*  That's what it's called. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2376.0s)]
*  Ancient Apocalypse. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2377.0s)]
*  Ancient Apocalypse. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2378.0s)]
*  That's what it's all about. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2379.0s)]
*  It's all about the evidence that points to the fact that human beings probably were super [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2380.0s)]
*  advanced somewhere before 12,000 years ago and we got smacked by comet debris. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2385.0s)]
*  I mean they even know what the comet is. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2392.0s)]
*  The torrid comet shower that comes every November and every June and the torrid meteor storm [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2394.0s)]
*  or whatever it is, the meteor cloud. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2401.0s)]
*  That exists. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2403.0s)]
*  They know physically we pass through it and they know there's some big pieces in there. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2404.0s)]
*  And they think that some of them smacked into earth around 12,800 years ago and there's [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2408.0s)]
*  like evidence in core samples and there's all this evidence in terms of like these buildings [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2413.0s)]
*  that they can't explain. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2417.0s)]
*  Like where the fuck, who's making this shit? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2418.0s)]
*  Really wild stuff, man. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2420.0s)]
*  So besides the dinosaurs they think there was something else? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2422.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2425.0s)]
*  The idea is that anatomically similar human beings. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2426.0s)]
*  They used to think that anatomically human beings were only like 50,000 years old. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2430.0s)]
*  But then they moved it to like 200,000 years old. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2434.0s)]
*  Now they're moving it past three, 400,000 years old. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2437.0s)]
*  Like us, similar. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2440.0s)]
*  So that means that's all that time to get better at stuff. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2441.0s)]
*  Like think about how much better we got in 200 fucking years. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2444.0s)]
*  Yeah, what were people doing? [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2447.0s)]
*  I mean, pick it up, dude. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2448.0s)]
*  Fucking lazy. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2449.0s)]
*  Well, they figured out technology and technology accelerates everything. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2450.0s)]
*  But if you go from 1820 to 2020, that is not that long. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2453.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2457.0s)]
*  In terms of history, that is. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2458.0s)]
*  You think you're like the Genghis Khan era. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2459.0s)]
*  When you think of 1200, 1200 to 1400, do you think it's that much of a difference? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2461.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2466.0s)]
*  It's all barbarians and crazy folks and syphilis and fucking hacking people to death [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2468.0s)]
*  and shooting arrows at them and shit. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2473.0s)]
*  They don't even have muskets, right? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2474.0s)]
*  When was the musket? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2477.0s)]
*  The musket was like right before. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2478.0s)]
*  What year was that? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2480.0s)]
*  Right before the Revolutionary War. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2481.0s)]
*  Was it? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2483.0s)]
*  Yeah, it had to be 1700s at some point. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2484.0s)]
*  Well, the Chinese were the first to figure out gunpowder. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2486.0s)]
*  But they did it for fireworks. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2489.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2490.0s)]
*  They didn't figure it out for weapons. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2491.0s)]
*  We took their stuff and just kind of made it better. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2492.0s)]
*  Let's be honest. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2495.0s)]
*  That's why we owe them one with all the electronics. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2496.0s)]
*  We do. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2499.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're hooking us up now. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2500.0s)]
*  Well, they're stealing all the intellectual property. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2501.0s)]
*  Like, hey, hey, hey, we had the reason why we were doing shit because we stole gunpowder. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2504.0s)]
*  And the noodle. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2507.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2508.0s)]
*  The noodle and gunpowder. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2509.0s)]
*  We took the noodle. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2510.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2511.0s)]
*  But the gunpowder thing is legit. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2512.0s)]
*  And yoga. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2513.0s)]
*  And we took yoga now. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2514.0s)]
*  Well, that's Indian, actually. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2515.0s)]
*  Well, South Asian, yeah. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2516.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a little different. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2517.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2520.0s)]
*  Yeah, the Indians, that's a fascinating culture, right? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2521.0s)]
*  They've been doing yoga for thousands of years. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2524.0s)]
*  They've been doing yoga. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2525.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2526.0s)]
*  Who figured that out? [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2527.0s)]
*  Some dude. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2528.0s)]
*  I know how to stay calm. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2529.0s)]
*  They also got the Kama Sutra. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2530.0s)]
*  What is this, Jamie? [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2533.0s)]
*  Musket. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2536.0s)]
*  Musket. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2537.0s)]
*  1500s. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2538.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2539.0s)]
*  1750 rifles started taking over. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2540.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2543.0s)]
*  So 1500s. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2544.0s)]
*  So the time from the 1200s to the 1400s, that ain't shit. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2545.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2549.0s)]
*  Nothing changed. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2550.0s)]
*  You still got bows and arrows. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2551.0s)]
*  You still got swords. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2552.0s)]
*  You still got living Game of Thrones style. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2553.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2554.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2555.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2556.0s)]
*  That's the only way you could do it. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2557.0s)]
*  You got catapults. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2558.0s)]
*  Those are so unspecific. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2559.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2560.0s)]
*  What do you got? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2561.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2562.0s)]
*  But now, in just 200 years, things are just insane. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2563.0s)]
*  You could fly to Japan tonight, right now. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2566.52s)]
*  On a plane, land in Japan, pay for things with your phone. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2569.0s)]
*  What? [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2573.0s)]
*  What? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2574.0s)]
*  Once we figured out a little security, we were able to let our mind and imagination go. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2575.0s)]
*  And our noses got shitty. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2579.0s)]
*  Our noses got shitty. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2580.0s)]
*  Our ears went bad. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2581.0s)]
*  I'm telling you, I think it's when we teamed up with dogs. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2582.0s)]
*  I think that's really what it is. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2584.0s)]
*  Oh, for sure, right? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2585.5s)]
*  That must have had a big effect. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2586.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2587.5s)]
*  They think that that had played a role, too, in us beating out the Neanderthals. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2588.5s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2592.0s)]
*  I thought we just fucked them all. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2593.0s)]
*  I think we probably fucked them. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2595.0s)]
*  We fucked them. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2596.0s)]
*  We probably killed a few, too. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2597.0s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2598.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2599.0s)]
*  We killed people. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2600.0s)]
*  Why wouldn't we kill other kinds of humans? [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2601.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2602.0s)]
*  And now they say that, I think, what, like, I think it's Asians and Europeans, Caucasians, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2603.0s)]
*  have some Neanderthal DNA. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2609.64s)]
*  I have 57% more than a regular person. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2611.0s)]
*  I do. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2614.0s)]
*  I do. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2615.0s)]
*  I got a 23 in me. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2616.0s)]
*  How much you have? [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2617.32s)]
*  It's quite a bit, man. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2618.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2620.0s)]
*  Someone fucked an Asian. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2621.0s)]
*  You know, I was reading something I wanted to ask about on this podcast, because I want [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2623.5s)]
*  to make sure that this is not just, like, one person who wrote this. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2627.48s)]
*  Someone wrote about, you know, they had that hobbit person on the island of Flores, that [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2631.44s)]
*  tiny person that lived on that island of Flores that they found that lived within human time [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2639.72s)]
*  period. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2645.72s)]
*  I think, like, they found bones that were, I think they lived there, what was it, like, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2646.72s)]
*  16, 17,000 years ago, something along those lines. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2650.72s)]
*  They think they might have had the same sort of thing in Hawaii. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2654.7999999999997s)]
*  And they were talking about this legend of this tiny little hairy man that lived on Hawaii. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2658.6s)]
*  Well, if they lived on the island of Flores, and if at one point in time the sea level [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2664.64s)]
*  was way, way, way lower, like during the ice age, and people traveled back, like, when [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2668.64s)]
*  we think of people traveling across the ocean, we think of the ocean that we have. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2673.24s)]
*  But the ocean during the ice age was, like, 400 meters lower, like, crazy distance, right? [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2676.7599999999998s)]
*  Something like that. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2683.04s)]
*  And in some spots, there's giant continents that don't even exist anymore. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2684.04s)]
*  They're just covered over by large swaths of ocean. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2687.56s)]
*  That is something that Graham Hancock goes over in this thing. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2690.3199999999997s)]
*  But if that was the case, and people, little tiny people, figured out how to get over to [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2692.88s)]
*  an island at one point in time, there's a thing called island dwarfism. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2697.0s)]
*  So like, things that live on islands, they get really small, like little tiny elephants [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2700.7200000000003s)]
*  and shit, and tiny humans, and that's what they think. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2704.8s)]
*  Like in order to preserve resources, these people just got really small. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2707.6000000000004s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2711.6400000000003s)]
*  It's sort of like when you have a plant in a smaller pot, it only grows a certain... [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2712.6400000000003s)]
*  Like bonsai trees, I guess, because you keep trimming them. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2716.0800000000004s)]
*  I think that might be a different thing. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2717.88s)]
*  Well, like, I've had some plants where I've had them in tiny pots and then they didn't [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2719.16s)]
*  grow... [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2722.52s)]
*  They only grew to like this much and then I put them in bigger pots and they just fucking... [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2723.52s)]
*  You know what's fucked though? [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2726.6s)]
*  Got bigger. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2727.6s)]
*  With lizards, the opposite happens. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2728.6s)]
*  You leave lizards on an island, they get bigger. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2730.24s)]
*  Wow. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2732.44s)]
*  That's like the Komodo dragon. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2733.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2734.72s)]
*  That fucking thing's huge. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2735.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2736.72s)]
*  That's like the biggest monitor lizard. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2737.72s)]
*  And rats, rats never stop growing, apparently. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2739.44s)]
*  Like they never stop growing. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2742.56s)]
*  What? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2743.88s)]
*  Yeah, they're insane. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2744.88s)]
*  They just keep growing. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2745.88s)]
*  What's the biggest rat ever? [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2746.88s)]
*  There's a big one. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2748.16s)]
*  There's a fucking big one. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2749.16s)]
*  I was looking at something recently and it's a massive rat. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2750.68s)]
*  Also they can chew through brick. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2755.04s)]
*  Those things are fucking... [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2757.2799999999997s)]
*  They're gonna survive if we get hit by an asteroid. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2758.8399999999997s)]
*  Are their teeth like a beaver teeth where they keep growing? [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2761.04s)]
*  Yeah, they keep growing and they can chew through brick. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2763.3599999999997s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2767.0s)]
*  Through brick they can chew. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2768.0s)]
*  I believe it. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2769.12s)]
*  They're nasty too. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2770.12s)]
*  Listen, go to Hawaii thing first before we get to the biggest rat. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2771.12s)]
*  Do they have a legend of a tiny person? [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2774.44s)]
*  There is a myth of something called Menehune, Hawaiian people. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2776.36s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2783.1600000000003s)]
*  Historical accounts of the little people of Hawaii. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2785.2400000000002s)]
*  I guarantee there was probably something similar. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2786.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't guarantee. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2789.84s)]
*  I'm just taking a guess. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2790.84s)]
*  But I mean if they have the thing in the island of Flores, have you heard about the Hobbit [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2792.32s)]
*  people? [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2795.28s)]
*  No, I've never heard about it. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2796.28s)]
*  Okay, so this mythical clan of Hawaiian people are known as supernatural stone workers with [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2797.28s)]
*  a long standing connection to the west side of the island of Kauai, Hawaii. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2803.12s)]
*  Historically Hawaiians believe that Menehune, Hawaiian people, to be small humans. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2808.52s)]
*  In fact there was a clan of people on Kauai and another on... [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2815.92s)]
*  How do you say that? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2818.92s)]
*  Kuaia, Kua, Ka'u, Ka'u, Ka'u. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2820.92s)]
*  Area of the big island in the early 1800s that Hawaiians identified with an earlier [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2824.52s)]
*  migration. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2829.36s)]
*  This highly respected R.S. Kukindal professor emeritus of history at the University of Hawaii [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2830.88s)]
*  also concluded that the Menehune were humans. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2837.76s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2841.44s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2844.2000000000003s)]
*  But then another guy, ethnologist Bruce Cartwright, sums up the problem with the lack of any evidence [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2845.56s)]
*  of material culture in the Hawaiian islands indicating a race of pre-Hawaiians and the [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2851.92s)]
*  lack of ancient traditions relating to such a race other than references to the Menehune [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2856.36s)]
*  people has been a puzzle. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2861.6s)]
*  However in 1851 the British Bishop, rather, Bishop Museum Bulletin, the Menehune of Polynesia [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2864.6s)]
*  described as the only survey about Menehune theories concluded that the Hawaiian people [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2871.44s)]
*  were not real humans. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2876.96s)]
*  So what were they? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2879.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2880.6s)]
*  This bulletin claimed the Hawaiian culture was altered under the influence of European [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2881.6s)]
*  contact and thus stone structures whose history had been forgotten were credited to the mythical [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2884.8s)]
*  Menehune. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2890.28s)]
*  Oh that's possible too. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2891.28s)]
*  But for sure they existed in the island of Flores because they have bones. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2893.52s)]
*  And so what they found out is there's a mythical creature called the Orang Pendek that lives [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2896.4s)]
*  in, isn't it like Polynesia or something like that? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2902.2000000000003s)]
*  We've talked about this before. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2904.88s)]
*  But they still have sightings where people claim to see these tiny little human like [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2906.4s)]
*  creatures with their covered in hair. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2912.04s)]
*  They always thought it was bullshit. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2913.7599999999998s)]
*  But then they found them on the island of Flores. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2915.08s)]
*  They found bones and they found tools. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2917.8s)]
*  So they think these were in some way some sort of intelligent human type creature that [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2920.72s)]
*  lived alongside human beings and lived in this one time period. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2925.88s)]
*  So they for sure know that. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2930.62s)]
*  I don't know how to respond to that. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2932.56s)]
*  What happened? [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2934.24s)]
*  Is that your watch? [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2935.24s)]
*  Fucking Siri. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2936.24s)]
*  Fucking Siri. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2937.24s)]
*  That bitch is always listening. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2938.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2939.24s)]
*  Go to the island of Flores timeline. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2940.56s)]
*  Homo floriensis. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2946.72s)]
*  Floriessis? [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2947.72s)]
*  That's how you say it. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2948.72s)]
*  So essentially there was... [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2952.08s)]
*  Floriensis. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2953.08s)]
*  Floriensis. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2954.08s)]
*  Homo floriensis. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2955.08s)]
*  Wow. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2956.08s)]
*  So there was multiple types of hominids living concurrently. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2957.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2960.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2961.72s)]
*  So what do they think the... [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2962.72s)]
*  What's the timeline of when they think they existed? [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2964.7599999999998s)]
*  So it says now dated from 60,000 to 100,000 years ago. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2970.3999999999996s)]
*  Oh, the most recent evidence of their existence back to 50,000 years ago. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2974.9199999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2979.2799999999997s)]
*  So originally they thought it was 12,000. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2980.2799999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2982.0s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2983.0s)]
*  Initially thought to be only 12,000 years ago. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2984.0s)]
*  More extensive stratigraphic and chronological work has been pushed or has pushed the dating [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2986.44s)]
*  of the most recent evidence of its existence back to 50,000 years ago. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2994.6800000000003s)]
*  The Homo floriensis skeletal material is now dated from 60,000 years to 100,000 years ago. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=2999.36s)]
*  Stone tools recovered alongside the skeletal remains were from archaeological horizons [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3008.48s)]
*  ranging from 50,000 years ago to 190,000 years ago. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3013.2s)]
*  So 50,000 years ago for sure there's anatomically similar humans and those things lived along [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3017.96s)]
*  with us. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3023.48s)]
*  So it's like when did they die off? [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3024.48s)]
*  Because in order for them to find them they have to find their bones. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3026.64s)]
*  And the thing about leaving bones behind is things eat bones. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3029.2799999999997s)]
*  So most things that die in the forest, you ain't going to find shit. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3032.8799999999997s)]
*  Try finding a dead mountain lion or a dead bear. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3037.52s)]
*  You'll find them for a little while and then eventually they'll eat each other. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3040.2799999999997s)]
*  They eat the bones. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3043.4399999999996s)]
*  And rats will eat the bones and then you get little pieces of bone all over the place. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3044.4799999999996s)]
*  And eventually those will probably be eaten by insects and other creatures. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3048.6s)]
*  Over the course of like 100 years or 1,000 years or 5,000 years things almost have to [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3051.7799999999997s)]
*  be fossilized or they have to be covered in some mud or some shit where they can dig to [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3057.2799999999997s)]
*  them and nothing eats them. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3062.72s)]
*  So like how many of them existed that you have shit that you're finding from 50,000 [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3064.52s)]
*  years ago? [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3070.0s)]
*  Because they found quite a few. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3071.0s)]
*  When did they die off? [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3073.2s)]
*  Was it 10,000 years ago? [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3074.2s)]
*  Was it 20? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3075.92s)]
*  Were they around 100 years ago? [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3077.52s)]
*  Like what is that? [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3079.14s)]
*  It's hard to know, right? [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3080.6s)]
*  Because they don't have a lot of evidence left to find. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3081.92s)]
*  And if they did live on that island there then they know that was a real thing on planet [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3084.72s)]
*  Earth. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3089.44s)]
*  And if that was a real thing on planet Earth and people are seeing them, I think is it [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3090.44s)]
*  Vietnam where they found the oring, where there's been sightings, recent sightings of [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3094.2s)]
*  this oring pendek and some of them are by like pretty reputable people. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3099.2799999999997s)]
*  How big were they? [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3103.04s)]
*  Were they like, tiny? [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3104.04s)]
*  Like smaller than a picnic? [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3105.04s)]
*  Tiny, tiny. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3106.04s)]
*  You know like three feet tall. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3107.04s)]
*  Wow. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3108.04s)]
*  Little tiny hairy people. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3109.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3110.04s)]
*  Imagine what a trip that would be. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3111.04s)]
*  A trip. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3112.04s)]
*  You're walking through the forest and you know you're with your wife and she's complaining [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3113.04s)]
*  and she's swatting mosquitoes and then all of a sudden you see like you're surrounded [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3115.04s)]
*  by little three feet people and they have like swords. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3118.72s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3122.3199999999997s)]
*  Spears rather. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3123.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3124.44s)]
*  Bows and arrows and shit and they're coming towards you. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3125.44s)]
*  Little tiny people. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3127.0800000000004s)]
*  At some point if there was that many different hominids on the planet it was kind of, it's [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3128.0800000000004s)]
*  almost like a supernatural fiction. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3132.2400000000002s)]
*  It was almost like a living end game of thrones. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3133.92s)]
*  Which is wild. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3136.1600000000003s)]
*  For sure. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3137.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean they probably preyed on each other's babies. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3138.1600000000003s)]
*  Just like bears do. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3140.28s)]
*  Yeah maybe they did. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3143.0s)]
*  For sure they did. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3144.1600000000003s)]
*  They found out they can get a baby. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3145.1600000000003s)]
*  Or maybe they were super fucking cool. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3146.32s)]
*  Baboons steal babies. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3148.6000000000004s)]
*  They do yeah. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3149.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah baboons will steal your baby and eat it. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3150.6800000000003s)]
*  They don't play by the rules. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3153.12s)]
*  No. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3154.12s)]
*  Polar bales will fucking chase down a baby if they're hungry and just eat it right. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3155.12s)]
*  One gulp. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3157.64s)]
*  Lions. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3158.64s)]
*  Throw that baby back. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3159.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3160.64s)]
*  I saw a zebra once drown in a rival's baby in the water. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3161.64s)]
*  It was brutal. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3167.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3168.3999999999996s)]
*  Animals, they lack manners sometimes. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3169.3999999999996s)]
*  They don't have any rules. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3170.7999999999997s)]
*  You ever see a Komodo dragon chucking down a whole monkey? [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3173.04s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3175.9599999999996s)]
*  Just like when you see them swallow a deer and shit. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3176.9599999999996s)]
*  They just use their throat and kind of swallow it. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3179.3199999999997s)]
*  Like a thing that's like half the size of their body. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3182.12s)]
*  They just swallow it. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3183.88s)]
*  Komodo dragons are the thing of nightmares. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3185.48s)]
*  But they're big and they live on an island. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3187.6s)]
*  So it's the opposite of island dwarfism with some animals. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3189.2400000000002s)]
*  Which is very weird. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3193.04s)]
*  And Samoans live on an island and they get big as fuck. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3194.08s)]
*  Big as fuck. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3196.44s)]
*  They get big as fuck. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3197.44s)]
*  Well I bet that you had to be hardy to survive. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3198.44s)]
*  Back then probably the only really strong people survived. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3202.88s)]
*  On Samoa? [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3206.6s)]
*  Look at the Vikings. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3207.6s)]
*  Right? [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3208.6s)]
*  Look at the people that live in Iceland now. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3209.6s)]
*  Those are all the descendants of the Vikings. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3211.2799999999997s)]
*  It's not a fucking coincidence why the strongest men in the world. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3212.2799999999997s)]
*  All those strongman competitions. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3215.12s)]
*  Motherfuckers are all Vikings. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3217.24s)]
*  They're all Scandinavian. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3218.24s)]
*  They're all these giant people like the mountain. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3219.24s)]
*  Like that dude. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3221.24s)]
*  What the fuck is that? [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3222.24s)]
*  That is interesting. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3223.92s)]
*  What is that? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3224.92s)]
*  And then you have all the long distance runners are always Ethiopian. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3225.92s)]
*  Something about the environment. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3230.3199999999997s)]
*  Something about the way they interact with the environment. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3231.3199999999997s)]
*  We are animals right? [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3234.08s)]
*  100%. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3235.2799999999997s)]
*  It just takes time for us to adapt. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3236.2799999999997s)]
*  But over many, many generations we thoroughly adapt. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3238.44s)]
*  That's where white people come from. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3242.52s)]
*  We're a big solar panel for vitamin D. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3244.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3246.6s)]
*  It's all how much you interact with the sun and how much sun there was. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3248.4s)]
*  Wasn't enough sun. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3252.08s)]
*  People had to stay alive. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3253.08s)]
*  So they had to adapt. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3254.08s)]
*  When you go to like north Europe, like the weather is like nuclear fallout. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3255.08s)]
*  It's just a coating of clouds. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3260.28s)]
*  You never see the sun. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3263.52s)]
*  It's terrible for you. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3264.92s)]
*  It's very terrible for your attitude too. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3266.52s)]
*  They killed themselves a lot. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3268.24s)]
*  They're all dour. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3269.24s)]
*  Like Seattle. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3270.24s)]
*  Yeah, and then I think of the highest suicide rate in northern Scandinavia. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3271.24s)]
*  They just off themselves. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3276.08s)]
*  They need sun. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3277.08s)]
*  They have sun lamps and shit. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3278.08s)]
*  The suicide rate in California is pretty high too though. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3279.84s)]
*  Unfortunately. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3282.04s)]
*  But there's different reasons why people do that. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3283.04s)]
*  Because they ran out of lattes? [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3284.44s)]
*  I think there has to be a balance. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3286.72s)]
*  I think you need a little shit weather to appreciate the nice weather. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3288.24s)]
*  Totally. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3291.2s)]
*  You do. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3292.2s)]
*  You need a little yin to your yang. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3293.2s)]
*  Yeah, California is like a spoiled trust fund baby when it comes to weather. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3294.2799999999997s)]
*  It's never had a work. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3297.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, at least when it comes to LA, it's not... [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3299.2799999999997s)]
*  People aren't supposed to be there. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3302.3599999999997s)]
*  There's no natural resources there. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3303.8399999999997s)]
*  That's desert. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3305.52s)]
*  They got to ship in their fucking water. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3306.52s)]
*  They got to ship in their people. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3307.52s)]
*  That was not supposed to be a place where people settled. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3309.9399999999996s)]
*  How come they haven't figured out that they just need to like full scale suck all the [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3313.48s)]
*  salt out of the ocean? [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3317.24s)]
*  You fucking dummies. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3318.48s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3319.48s)]
*  Stop spending all this money on other shit. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3320.48s)]
*  You've got a water problem. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3322.96s)]
*  You've got all the water in the world right next door. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3323.96s)]
*  Figure it out. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3326.56s)]
*  Figure it out. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3327.56s)]
*  Why do you have all these wire fires? [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3328.56s)]
*  You should have giant fucking hoses that are connected to the ocean that spray water all [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3331.36s)]
*  over the plants and trees. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3336.4s)]
*  Spray it everywhere. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3338.76s)]
*  What the fuck are you doing? [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3339.76s)]
*  We could be living in a lush jungle. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3341.64s)]
*  It could be amazing here. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3343.28s)]
*  Or in California at least. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3345.28s)]
*  I wonder why. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3346.44s)]
*  I wonder why they haven't figured it out. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3347.44s)]
*  They're dumb. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3348.44s)]
*  They're not as smart as us, to be honest, Papas. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3349.44s)]
*  We've got to figure it out, bro. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3350.92s)]
*  We're right here figuring every single thing out. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3352.32s)]
*  Figuring it all out. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3354.96s)]
*  We figured out about these hominids. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3357.88s)]
*  We got it all figured out. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3359.76s)]
*  They've done a little bit of that desalination, but never like large scale where they could [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3360.76s)]
*  turn all the brown spots into green. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3364.96s)]
*  But they should. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3367.1200000000003s)]
*  When they do that, probably then like all those places that are threatened by rising [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3368.4s)]
*  sea level will be able, like your real estate investment will be secure like in Miami. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3373.2400000000002s)]
*  Suck that water out of there. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3377.48s)]
*  Fuck that water. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3378.48s)]
*  Throw it. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3379.64s)]
*  Take the water from Miami and throw it into LA. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3380.64s)]
*  A hundred years from now, there'll be a save the ocean campaign because we'll have drained [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3383.32s)]
*  the ocean to make golf courses. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3387.84s)]
*  We're watering golf courses all over the place and there's no more water left in the ocean. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3389.64s)]
*  There's like a small patch of water and everyone's like, fuck you, we got lakes. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3394.84s)]
*  We don't need your fucking stupid ocean. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3398.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3400.52s)]
*  Why haven't they though? [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3401.52s)]
*  You're right because they know how to build islands. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3402.52s)]
*  I mean, you look at Dubai, they just built that fucking place. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3403.92s)]
*  They have desalination plants, but as far as I know, they never scaled it to the point [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3406.92s)]
*  where it could supply the water for an entire city. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3410.56s)]
*  I would imagine that would be huge. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3412.48s)]
*  It would probably have to be nuclear powered. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3414.4s)]
*  But if it's, which sounds contradictory, but that would be the way to do it. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3417.52s)]
*  You'd have a very clean source of energy as long as it's, they make sure all the fail [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3421.56s)]
*  safes are in place and it doesn't go down. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3426.12s)]
*  And then you use that energy to process water and take out the salts. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3428.26s)]
*  And now you have an infinite supply of water because you're connected to an infinite supply [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3432.4s)]
*  of water. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3436.08s)]
*  It's right there. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3437.08s)]
*  It's like you have one step missing. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3438.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3439.08s)]
*  Like if we lived, if that was a lake, if that was the cleanest freshwater lake in the world, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3440.08s)]
*  we'd have no water problems. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3444.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3445.04s)]
*  We just suck that water out of there and spray it all over the place. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3446.04s)]
*  But because it's salt water, like, I don't know what to do. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3448.84s)]
*  I don't know what to do. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3451.44s)]
*  They do have desalination, but it's a possible thing. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3453.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3456.3199999999997s)]
*  It can be done. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3457.3199999999997s)]
*  It's probably really hard, but you're making it sound really easy. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3458.3199999999997s)]
*  I know it's hard. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3460.08s)]
*  You're like, yeah, just take the fucking water. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3461.08s)]
*  I know it's hard. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3462.7599999999998s)]
*  I know it's also something that's not like brought up every day. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3463.84s)]
*  Like when people run it for governor, they never say, hey, we got all this water. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3466.0s)]
*  It's right there. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3469.28s)]
*  Let's take the salt out of the water. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3470.28s)]
*  Everybody be like, oh. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3471.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3472.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3473.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3474.28s)]
*  Just build the biggest fucking death star desalination plant. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3475.28s)]
*  Just monolith. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3479.0800000000004s)]
*  Just constantly employ the entire state. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3480.0800000000004s)]
*  You're creating jobs too, man. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3484.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, creating jobs. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3485.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3486.6400000000003s)]
*  Creating jobs, sucking all that salt out of the water. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3487.6400000000003s)]
*  And then all of a sudden California is just lush green. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3489.2400000000002s)]
*  It looks like Vietnam. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3491.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3492.76s)]
*  There would be no more water laws so you can fucking. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3493.76s)]
*  Go crazy. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3495.76s)]
*  Golf courses for everybody. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3496.76s)]
*  You can wash your face with water and shower longer from all the shame of whatever you [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3498.44s)]
*  did to get that role. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3502.2400000000002s)]
*  You remember when people got shamed for the ice bucket challenge? [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3503.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3505.84s)]
*  You're wasting water. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3506.84s)]
*  You're wasting water. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3507.84s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3508.84s)]
*  I caught you wasting water. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3509.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3512.84s)]
*  I remember Matt Damon decided he wasn't going to waste water. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3513.84s)]
*  So he did it like in his toilet or something. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3519.92s)]
*  He did the ice bucket challenge and then went into his toilet. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3522.4s)]
*  Something similar to that. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3525.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3526.7999999999997s)]
*  He's better than everyone else. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3527.7999999999997s)]
*  Then he hopped on a private jet. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3528.7999999999997s)]
*  Did I make that up? [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3531.36s)]
*  Did I make that up? [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3532.36s)]
*  I feel like he did that. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3533.36s)]
*  I feel like he did something eco-intelligent. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3534.84s)]
*  Actually, no. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3536.3199999999997s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3537.3199999999997s)]
*  He got the water from the toilet. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3538.3199999999997s)]
*  There you go. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3542.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, he's such a conservationist. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3543.2799999999997s)]
*  But wait a minute. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3544.7599999999998s)]
*  That's still wasting water. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3545.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3546.7599999999998s)]
*  Someone needs to talk to him. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3547.7599999999998s)]
*  Did he throw it back in the toilet? [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3548.7599999999998s)]
*  He should stand in the toilet. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3550.2s)]
*  He should have gone into the fetal position in the toilet and then the challenge. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3552.44s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3555.4s)]
*  He's getting the water from the toilet. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3556.4s)]
*  So that makes it okay. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3557.84s)]
*  That's still water out of the pipe, Matt Damon. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3559.32s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3561.84s)]
*  That's still water out of the pipe. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3563.44s)]
*  Someone tell him where the water comes from. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3565.0800000000004s)]
*  He's like, make sure you film the part where I'm taking it out of the toilet so people [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3569.1600000000003s)]
*  know that I care about this. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3571.88s)]
*  That's a fetish. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3573.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3574.6000000000004s)]
*  That's a fetish. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3575.6000000000004s)]
*  He just peed on himself. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3576.6000000000004s)]
*  He just had a lot of water, so it was clear pee. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3577.6000000000004s)]
*  No, I honestly thought the water problem was because comments were turned off on that video. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3580.1600000000003s)]
*  I wonder why. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3584.0400000000004s)]
*  I wonder why. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3585.0400000000004s)]
*  Maybe some intelligent people could have pointed something out. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3586.0400000000004s)]
*  That's the same water from the same pipes, Matt Damon. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3587.96s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think you're helping. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3591.2000000000003s)]
*  Just because you put it in the toilet first doesn't make you... [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3592.8s)]
*  No. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3595.28s)]
*  You're still throwing water at yourself. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3596.28s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3599.6800000000003s)]
*  That's what you call a strong virtue signal right there. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3601.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3603.1200000000003s)]
*  But that's for a challenge. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3604.1200000000003s)]
*  Nobody gets mad at you for wasting water for a cold plunge. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3605.1200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3607.5600000000004s)]
*  Because now you're doing it for your health. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3608.5600000000004s)]
*  Or if you leave the shower running while you're taking a shit. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3610.36s)]
*  People probably do that in LA too. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3612.72s)]
*  They shower extra long, like I said, because they got to wash off the shame. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3614.2799999999997s)]
*  Things they got to do in LA. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3618.6s)]
*  You got to curl up in the corner and just let the water hit you. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3619.6s)]
*  I said, God, what I had to do. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3623.2s)]
*  Speaking of shame, you and I are the perfect people to talk about this crypto collapse. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3625.32s)]
*  Because we're scientists. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3632.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3633.2799999999997s)]
*  Economists. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3634.2799999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3635.2799999999997s)]
*  Strong opinions and no information. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3637.0s)]
*  Which is a great combination when you're dealing with the fact that people have lost billions [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3638.0s)]
*  and billions of dollars. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3643.1600000000003s)]
*  So Jamie's been filling me in on this over the weekend. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3645.1600000000003s)]
*  And he also is an economist. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3647.32s)]
*  Jamie is our go-to expert on this. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3649.32s)]
*  I'll just find interesting links and say, hey, check this out. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3652.88s)]
*  Which is fine. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3656.52s)]
*  That's journalism. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3657.52s)]
*  And as a journalist, what's your conclusion? [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3658.52s)]
*  It seems like, well, here's the thing. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3665.24s)]
*  If you're running any kind of currency operation and you're involved in a polyamorous relationship [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3668.2799999999997s)]
*  with seven other people, I got to think you're wacky. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3675.6s)]
*  Nine. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3678.52s)]
*  Nine other people? [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3679.52s)]
*  Ten. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3680.52s)]
*  Ten total. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3681.52s)]
*  What do they do? [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3682.52s)]
*  They just were polyamorous living in a house together? [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3683.52s)]
*  They all live together in the same place, in the Bahamas. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3684.52s)]
*  And then they all just banged each other. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3686.16s)]
*  Hey. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3687.9199999999996s)]
*  So, wait, set this up because you're kind of starting in the middle. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3688.9199999999996s)]
*  What are we talking about here? [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3691.7599999999998s)]
*  Fun. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3692.7599999999998s)]
*  Talk about a lot of fun in the Bahamas with billions of dollars of other people's money. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3694.28s)]
*  Woo, woo. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3697.88s)]
*  Is it called a tax haven? [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3698.88s)]
*  Tax haven. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3700.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3701.88s)]
*  So this fella was running this exchange and they also had tokens. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3702.88s)]
*  Someone explained it. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3709.1200000000003s)]
*  Someone did a really good job of explaining it. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3710.44s)]
*  And we could play that video, but it might take too much time. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3712.5200000000004s)]
*  It's like a 12-minute video. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3714.92s)]
*  But he was explaining how these tokens are like, they're essentially unregulated, but [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3716.4s)]
*  it's almost like you're owning stock or almost like owning coin. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3723.56s)]
*  It's very confusing, but it's one of those classic examples of people try to cash in [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3728.72s)]
*  and then the whole thing came down. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3735.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the term Ponzi scheme has been thrown around quite a lot. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3736.4s)]
*  Well, there's not just that. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3739.36s)]
*  There seems to be money missing, like a lot of money missing that got moved from one corporation [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3740.94s)]
*  to a sister corporation. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3746.12s)]
*  So this is FTX, right? [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3747.56s)]
*  Yes. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3749.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3750.56s)]
*  Apparently they reached out to Coinbase. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3751.88s)]
*  I read that they reached out to Coinbase and Coinbase is like, we can't help you. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3754.6s)]
*  This looks bad. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3758.74s)]
*  Like what's going on over here? [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3759.74s)]
*  And then now it's sort of imminently collapsing and tons of people have invested tons of money [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3761.52s)]
*  over there and they don't know what the fuck is going on. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3766.18s)]
*  People are trying to pull their money out by buying NFTs for ridiculous amounts of money [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3768.36s)]
*  in the Bahamas because apparently people in the Bahamas still have access to the thing, [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3773.72s)]
*  to the exchange. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3780.88s)]
*  Is that the case? [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3781.88s)]
*  Yep. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3782.88s)]
*  Then they would imagine that they're reaching out to the person and buying this NFT that [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3783.88s)]
*  would have yesterday been worth $9 and now it's bought for like $10 million to then make [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3787.2000000000003s)]
*  like a currency exchange. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3791.6800000000003s)]
*  Like, you can keep 10% of that. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3793.2000000000003s)]
*  They jack up the value of it. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3795.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3797.1600000000003s)]
*  So they basically say, look, I'm going to buy your NFT for $10 million. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3798.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm going to give you a million dollars and then you give me the nine back. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3801.6400000000003s)]
*  And so that's how they're exchanging money and trying to just draw it out of this account. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3805.6400000000003s)]
*  Who knows how that's going to work out? [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3809.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3810.88s)]
*  What are the people going to be like, fuck you, I got your money. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3811.88s)]
*  You're like, how does that work? [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3812.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3814.44s)]
*  But all of it is run by this guy who they were in the middle of profiling him. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3815.44s)]
*  Who sent me this? [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3823.92s)]
*  I did. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3824.92s)]
*  Michael Lewis is the guy's name. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3825.92s)]
*  He's the writer of like Moneyball and the Big Short, many books. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3826.92s)]
*  And so he was in the middle of profiling this guy when everything collapsed, which is wild. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3831.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3836.92s)]
*  Wild. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3837.92s)]
*  That is very wild. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3839.7200000000003s)]
*  Wild. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3840.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3841.7200000000003s)]
*  Like what are the odds that that happens at the exact same time? [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3842.7200000000003s)]
*  Because this guy was this wonder kid who had developed this thing, was worth $15 billion [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3845.16s)]
*  and was like wearing pajamas and shit, like one of those like eccentric cats. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3852.52s)]
*  Didn't all the crypto kind of take a big massive hit though? [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3856.6800000000003s)]
*  I think all of crypto did take a big massive hit, but I think this is a lot crazier than [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3859.76s)]
*  that. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3864.32s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3865.32s)]
*  This isn't just like crypto took a hit, everybody's business is fucked. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3866.32s)]
*  This is like shenanigans. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3868.44s)]
*  Like some high level, like serious shenanigans. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3869.44s)]
*  The most generous billionaire. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3874.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3876.04s)]
*  That's part of the, so there's like, yeah, this has been unfolding like in real time [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3877.04s)]
*  on Twitter, which has been an interesting place to be for the last few weeks. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3881.88s)]
*  But this guy apparently during this used a PR, I don't know if this would be a scheme, [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3886.04s)]
*  but a YouTuber, it was paid to make this piece about him and the way he gives away money, [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3891.04s)]
*  which adds to. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3897.2s)]
*  Well, he wanted people to know. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3898.2s)]
*  He wanted people to know he's a good guy. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3899.2s)]
*  He reached out to Elon apparently while Elon was buying Twitter and offered to chip in [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3904.2s)]
*  three billion. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3908.52s)]
*  And he said, Elon said that set his bullshit meter off. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3909.52s)]
*  Cause like Elon's a serious dude. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3912.4399999999996s)]
*  And you say, he's like, this guy's three million liquid or a billion rather, three billion [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3914.9199999999996s)]
*  liquid. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3919.48s)]
*  Like does he have that money? [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3920.48s)]
*  That's a lot of money. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3921.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3922.48s)]
*  Say like we're going to buy Twitter for 44. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3923.48s)]
*  I'm in for three. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3924.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3925.48s)]
*  Three billion. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3926.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3927.76s)]
*  That's a crazy amount of money. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3928.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3929.76s)]
*  And so Elon said that set his bullshit meter off. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3930.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3931.76s)]
*  Cause like what, where did he get the three billion? [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3932.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3933.76s)]
*  You can't just say that to that guy. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3934.76s)]
*  It's like, oh cool. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3935.76s)]
*  And he's not going to just say, oh cool. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3936.76s)]
*  He's going to know basically what you can and can't. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3937.76s)]
*  He's a fucking, he's the richest guy in the world. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3940.2400000000002s)]
*  He understands money. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3941.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3942.96s)]
*  And he knows who really has that money and who may be laundering. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3943.96s)]
*  Well, who might be just kind of a crazy person who, you know, is probably can't believe he's [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3946.96s)]
*  in where he's at. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3953.12s)]
*  When you find stories about him from before, he was like the world's youngest billionaire [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3954.44s)]
*  happened super fast. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3958.48s)]
*  World richest person under 30 committed billions. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3959.8s)]
*  The vast majority of his fortune to tackling the most pressing problems facing the future [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3962.48s)]
*  of humanity. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3966.78s)]
*  Where did he get his money though? [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3967.78s)]
*  Click on that. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3969.36s)]
*  What are those most pressing problems? [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3970.36s)]
*  Click on that link. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3971.48s)]
*  What is that link up there? [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3972.48s)]
*  This is, it's on Reddit. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3973.84s)]
*  Oh, it's on Reddit. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3975.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3977.88s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3978.88s)]
*  Like, I understand where Elon made his money. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3979.88s)]
*  I think like all things, he's probably not all bad. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3983.16s)]
*  It just didn't work out the way he thought it was going to and it was for so long. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3988.12s)]
*  And he probably thought he could get away with doing what he was doing. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3992.2799999999997s)]
*  And he probably also thought he was doing good. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3995.04s)]
*  So if he really is like super charitable, he probably also thought that he was way smarter [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=3997.22s)]
*  than he was, right? [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4002.2s)]
*  Because he's under 30 and he's a billionaire already. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4003.2s)]
*  He probably thinks he's the fucking shit. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4006.3999999999996s)]
*  Could you imagine if you were worth 15 billion and you were 28, you would think you're the [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4008.52s)]
*  shit. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4012.44s)]
*  You think you could do whatever. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4013.44s)]
*  And also you're banging nine people in the house together. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4014.44s)]
*  Yeah, I'd be doing bad stuff. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4016.6s)]
*  That's too much money for a 20 something year old. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4018.48s)]
*  You're not playing by any rules. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4019.96s)]
*  Anybody's rules. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4020.96s)]
*  Fuck off. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4021.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4022.96s)]
*  And I'm going to give my money away to everybody. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4023.96s)]
*  And I'm also going to move 10 billion over here. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4024.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4026.36s)]
*  I'm going to push it to this sister company. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4027.36s)]
*  I want to keep that rolling. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4028.36s)]
*  And this going. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4029.36s)]
*  We got the coins and then we got the tokens. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4030.36s)]
*  We got this and that. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4031.36s)]
*  And like, I don't understand that whole world of crypto because there's so many of them [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4032.36s)]
*  now. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4037.32s)]
*  Bitcoin, at least to me, was sort of semi-tangible. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4038.32s)]
*  It's like, oh, there's this thing. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4040.32s)]
*  There's a limited amount of them. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4043.2400000000002s)]
*  This guy who made it is like a mysterious fellow. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4044.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, Satoshi Nakamura, right? [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4048.1600000000003s)]
*  That's his name. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4050.28s)]
*  Nakamoto. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4051.28s)]
*  Nakamoto. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4052.28s)]
*  Satoshi Nakamoto. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4053.28s)]
*  Nobody knows who he is. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4054.28s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4055.28s)]
*  All the speculation. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4056.28s)]
*  But he developed this currency, this cryptocurrency. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4057.28s)]
*  And it's basically that's the king of cryptos. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4058.76s)]
*  Wouldn't you say Bitcoin is the king? [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4060.48s)]
*  Oh, I mean, yeah, sure. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4062.52s)]
*  The most popular. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4064.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4065.84s)]
*  And the original big one. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4066.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4067.84s)]
*  Like, yeah. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4068.84s)]
*  Made sense. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4069.84s)]
*  The centralized currency and the federal government controlling everything and fucking inflation, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4071.36s)]
*  all this shit. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4075.8s)]
*  There's only a certain amount of those. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4076.8s)]
*  Ever. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4077.8s)]
*  Forever. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4078.8s)]
*  And ever and ever and ever. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4079.8s)]
*  But then a bunch of them pop up. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4080.8s)]
*  Right? [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4081.8s)]
*  Now you got how many cryptos do they have? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4082.8s)]
*  At one point, some of them were being named after animals. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4083.8s)]
*  Dog coin, dodge coin, dolphin coin. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4086.88s)]
*  I don't even remember. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4089.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4090.52s)]
*  Joke. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4091.52s)]
*  Joke coins. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4092.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4093.52s)]
*  Joke. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4094.52s)]
*  Wasn't the doggy coin, the doge coin? [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4095.52s)]
*  Started as a joke. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4096.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4097.52s)]
*  A joke. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4098.52s)]
*  And now it's worth fucking trillions of dollars or something. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4099.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4101.200000000001s)]
*  Oh, not anymore? [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4102.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's all kind of tanked. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4103.200000000001s)]
*  Did that one go down too? [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4104.200000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4105.200000000001s)]
*  It was all based on how much value. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4106.200000000001s)]
*  It hasn't gone down? [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4107.200000000001s)]
*  No, dodge coin still up there? [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4108.200000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4109.200000000001s)]
*  What's it worth now? [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4110.200000000001s)]
*  Depending on when it's, I mean, compared to a dollar. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4112.200000000001s)]
*  Let's Google it right now. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4117.320000000001s)]
*  How much is each doge coin worth? [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4118.400000000001s)]
*  Eight and a half cents. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4120.120000000001s)]
*  Eight and a half cents. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4121.120000000001s)]
*  And what's a bitcoin worth? [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4122.360000000001s)]
*  Probably 16.5, I think, right now. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4123.360000000001s)]
*  $16,500? [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4128.360000000001s)]
*  16.5. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4129.360000000001s)]
*  16.2. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4131.2s)]
*  Wow. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4132.2s)]
*  See, that's the one that people count on the most as being semi-stable. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4133.2s)]
*  But even that one goes way up and way down. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4136.32s)]
*  But what are they counting on exactly? [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4138.36s)]
*  What are they going to do with their bitcoin? [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4140.5599999999995s)]
*  Who fucking knows? [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4142.12s)]
*  You're going to get, buy something before someone figures out it's not worth anything. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4143.12s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4146.12s)]
*  It's a game you're playing. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4147.12s)]
*  Just go chairs. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4148.12s)]
*  I understand the stock market because you're investing in something that's a thing that's [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4149.12s)]
*  doing something. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4154.96s)]
*  It's a company that's doing something that you can understand. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4155.96s)]
*  This just sounds like you're using your real money in that it's the money that you can [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4160.5599999999995s)]
*  use to buy things now, to buy imaginary money that is supposed to be worth something down [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4164.48s)]
*  the line that's not yet, that everyone's trying to get it on because of that belief. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4169.679999999999s)]
*  And then it can go up or down. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4175.36s)]
*  But it does go up or down. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4177.32s)]
*  It does go up. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4178.32s)]
*  So people do make money. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4179.32s)]
*  There are absolutely crypto billionaires out there. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4180.32s)]
*  But that's because it's being sold as something that you need to have for the future. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4182.5599999999995s)]
*  Sort of. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4187.5199999999995s)]
*  You can have it right now though. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4188.52s)]
*  Andreas Antonopoulos, the guy who's been on my podcast, talked about Bitcoin in the past. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4189.92s)]
*  Everything he does is he pays for in Bitcoin. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4195.4400000000005s)]
*  His whole life. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4197.64s)]
*  His salary, when he buys things, he does everything in Bitcoin. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4198.64s)]
*  Where does he? [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4202.8s)]
*  Here's a for instance. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4203.8s)]
*  Does he go to a coffee shop and he just- [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4204.8s)]
*  Bitcoin. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4205.8s)]
*  He goes to a strip club and he makes it rain invisible Bitcoins on the way. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4206.8s)]
*  TomBot burnt that fun gift for his birthday, but he had to pay it all in cash because you [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4209.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4215.2s)]
*  Can't do that transaction through credit cards or however the normal way would have been. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4216.2s)]
*  He could have probably paid that guy in Bitcoin if that guy accepted Bitcoin. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4219.16s)]
*  And it would have been done in seconds instead of weeks. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4222.92s)]
*  There you go. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4225.32s)]
*  But how much- so that whole issue with the amount of energy it takes to store them on [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4226.32s)]
*  the blockchain or whatever, is that something that is an impediment to the future of Bitcoin [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4230.76s)]
*  because they say it takes so much space and power? [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4236.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, that's possible. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4240.04s)]
*  But wouldn't that make sense that as technology improves it would be easier to do that? [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4241.86s)]
*  That seems like an easier problem to surmount than the problems we have with centralized [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4247.86s)]
*  digital- or centralized digital currency scares the shit out of me. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4251.66s)]
*  If they had a digital currency that the government controlled, we'd be fucked. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4255.38s)]
*  Because then they would institute some sort of a social credit score system just like [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4258.9s)]
*  China has. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4261.7s)]
*  And when you want to buy something, depending on your tweet history or what you've said [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4263.139999999999s)]
*  or what you've done, they could come down on you. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4268.5s)]
*  I just got skeptical when I saw commercials for it. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4272.139999999999s)]
*  This is a commercial for money? [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4274.66s)]
*  With Larry David in it? [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4277.099999999999s)]
*  I never saw a commercial for, hey, buy a hundred dollar bill. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4278.54s)]
*  Didn't Matt Damon have a bunch? [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4282.58s)]
*  He had a bunch too. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4283.98s)]
*  Tom Brady, everybody. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4284.98s)]
*  They were making it like you're going to space? [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4285.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4287.98s)]
*  For clarity though, I believe this is a- I'm not speaking from a place of knowledge, but [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4288.98s)]
*  I think they were advertising more of a place to exchange as opposed to just the actual [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4294.26s)]
*  Bitcoin. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4299.34s)]
*  So I think they were also advertising the idea of embracing this new digital currency. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4301.42s)]
*  That's what they're doing. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4307.62s)]
*  People got mad at them when it crashed. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4308.62s)]
*  Kim Kardashian actually got into trouble. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4310.42s)]
*  She got into- [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4312.46s)]
*  Because she was telling people to buy crypto when it crashed? [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4313.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4316.74s)]
*  Something- she actually got into legal trouble because of it. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4317.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4320.22s)]
*  Because basically they were selling something that now has made a lot of people go broke. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4321.22s)]
*  They're selling what the Diaz brothers like to call wolf tickets. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4326.02s)]
*  Wolf tickets, dog. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4328.46s)]
*  That's what they were selling. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4329.46s)]
*  They're selling a bunch of bullshit. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4330.5s)]
*  SEC charges Kim Kardashian for unlawfully touting crypto security. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4332.5s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4337.14s)]
*  The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Kim Kardashian. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4338.14s)]
*  You do not want that statement to ever be read. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4342.38s)]
*  No. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4345.58s)]
*  The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Kim Kardashian for [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4346.58s)]
*  touting on social media a crypto asset security offered and sold by Ethereum Max without disclosing [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4351.02s)]
*  the payment she received for the promotion. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4357.26s)]
*  Kardashian agreed to settle the charges, pay $1.26 million in penalties, disgorgement [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4359.94s)]
*  and interest, and cooperate with the commission's ongoing investigation. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4366.46s)]
*  Yo. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4371.74s)]
*  She's got problems with the man. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4374.66s)]
*  So the man says the SEC order finds that Kardashian failed to disclose that she was paid $250,000 [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4376.719999999999s)]
*  to publish a post on her Instagram account about Emacs tokens, the crypto asset security [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4382.98s)]
*  being offered by Ethereum Max. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4388.3s)]
*  Kardashian's post contained a link to the Ethereum Max website, which provided instructions [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4390.780000000001s)]
*  for potential investors to purchase Emacs tokens. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4396.06s)]
*  The only way that those tokens have value is if they're promoted by influencers and [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4400.22s)]
*  celebrities for you to get like, oh, they're just by them endorsing them. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4407.02s)]
*  That's the only way they can have value. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4414.66s)]
*  Otherwise, they don't represent anything that's being done. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4416.02s)]
*  A token freaks me out. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4419.580000000001s)]
*  That's a new thing I don't understand. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4421.9800000000005s)]
*  What is the difference between a token, which is one of the points of contention about this [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4424.18s)]
*  FTX thing, and a coin? [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4427.900000000001s)]
*  They're different things. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4431.820000000001s)]
*  They can be. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4433.34s)]
*  This guy was explaining it and I was like, what the fuck? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4436.700000000001s)]
*  This guy was an expert in finance. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4439.14s)]
*  He contacted them and he gave them a series of proposals in order, I think they wanted [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4443.42s)]
*  to invest in something and they literally said back to him, go fuck yourself. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4449.34s)]
*  This is why I was always skeptical of it because like, look, I'm not a smart dude, right? [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4454.26s)]
*  But astrophysics should be hard to understand, but like money should be a simple explanation. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4457.42s)]
*  And anytime I would ask questions about Bitcoin, I just couldn't understand it. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4464.62s)]
*  It was like when someone tried to explain the sport curling to me. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4468.38s)]
*  I'm like, I still don't fucking get what's going on. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4471.18s)]
*  Yeah, you're never going to get it. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4473.42s)]
*  If it's too hard to understand, then I get like, oh, something's fishy. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4475.860000000001s)]
*  It's very cultural though. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4479.14s)]
*  The curling thing is like baseball. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4480.14s)]
*  What are they doing now? [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4482.02s)]
*  Are they cleaning the ice? [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4483.02s)]
*  No, they're pushing a fucking hockey puck and trying to make it knock into the other [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4484.02s)]
*  one or get into the perfect circle. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4488.06s)]
*  It's the shit you do when you're frozen in for eight months at a time and you're in the [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4489.58s)]
*  middle of the north of Canada. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4494.62s)]
*  Play that link. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4497.700000000001s)]
*  This guy kind of explains what happened. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4498.700000000001s)]
*  We'll get to the first couple of minutes of it. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4500.78s)]
*  That was still a vague explanation. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4502.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4504.38s)]
*  It's fucking, they get real touchy about it up there. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4505.38s)]
*  I was knocking it one time. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4508.02s)]
*  I was up there doing a show and I was like, you know, like the people that were in the [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4509.3s)]
*  audience, the place where you walk through and you get seated was all filled with pictures [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4514.22s)]
*  of curling events. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4519.1s)]
*  So they had a bunch of curling events there while they were doing comedy shows. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4520.76s)]
*  We were just shitting all over curling and they were like, you can tell they're actually [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4524.22s)]
*  barred out. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4528.14s)]
*  I was about to pull up two. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4529.14s)]
*  Well, just play the other one because the other one, he gets it to it right away and [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4530.740000000001s)]
*  he explains the video that I just sent you, the YouTube video. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4534.780000000001s)]
*  I saw that same thing on this. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4537.14s)]
*  Just saying. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4538.860000000001s)]
*  In that $17 billion round and I did a Zoom with him and after the Zoom, I'm like, this [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4539.860000000001s)]
*  doesn't make much sense, but I'll have my team do some work. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4546.02s)]
*  We did some work and we sent him a two page deck and we said, here are our recommendations [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4548.860000000001s)]
*  for taking the next step. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4553.58s)]
*  One was the formation of a board. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4556.14s)]
*  The second was the creation of dual class doc. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4558.3s)]
*  The third was some reps and warranties around affiliated transactions and related party [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4560.5s)]
*  transactions and the person that worked there called us back and literally, I'm not kidding [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4564.74s)]
*  you said, go fuck yourself. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4570.74s)]
*  He pitched us. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4572.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4574.54s)]
*  So that was part of it. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4575.54s)]
*  The reason why I wanted you to play the video, the YouTube video has more of it and the YouTube [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4577.18s)]
*  video also I wanted to credit whoever put it up there so they could get people to see [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4582.26s)]
*  it. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4585.820000000001s)]
*  So what was the YouTube video title? [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4587.5199999999995s)]
*  It says this collapse is way bigger than SBF. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4589.639999999999s)]
*  How do you say his name? [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4592.5599999999995s)]
*  Chamath. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4594.719999999999s)]
*  Chamath. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4595.719999999999s)]
*  How do you say the last name though? [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4596.719999999999s)]
*  No idea. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4597.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4598.719999999999s)]
*  Pali Hop Itia reacts to FDX. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4599.719999999999s)]
*  Sorry if I fucked up your name, sir. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4605.599999999999s)]
*  But it's the only the savvy SAVVY YouTube page. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4608.24s)]
*  And so this is longer and it explains like what these people were doing and the token [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4613.26s)]
*  part. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4618.4800000000005s)]
*  So if you give it the following story of FTX and Sam Bankman Fried is playing that Netflix [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4619.4800000000005s)]
*  documentary. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4624.820000000001s)]
*  Imagine that fellow taking care of your money episode in real time. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4625.900000000001s)]
*  Fuck Twitter has alleged that Sam Bankman Fried was on the run and tried to flee to [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4629.14s)]
*  South America. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4633.08s)]
*  Others believed he tried to flee to Dubai. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4634.860000000001s)]
*  Coin Telegraph reported that Bahamian authorities have Bankman Fried and two other executives [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4637.74s)]
*  under supervision. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4642.36s)]
*  Reuters reported that they reached out to SBF to ask him via text if he left the Bahamas [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4644.16s)]
*  and he said, nope. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4648.599999999999s)]
*  After lying to his followers continually on Twitter about anything pertinent to FTX, it [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4650.76s)]
*  would be very hard to imagine him answering. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4655.08s)]
*  Yes, I'm on the run. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4656.88s)]
*  Bye bye. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4658.599999999999s)]
*  Tata. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4659.599999999999s)]
*  Goodbye. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4660.599999999999s)]
*  But anyway, more and more high level people are sharing their experiences with SBF and [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4661.599999999999s)]
*  looking back for any red flags and what they might have missed. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4665.92s)]
*  Elon Musk took to Twitter to confirm a story about SBF investing $3 billion into Twitter. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4670.0s)]
*  Elon said that SBF set off his BS detector as a guest on the All In podcast. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4675.4s)]
*  Brian Armstrong also suggested that something was off when he compared Coinbase's revenues [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4680.8s)]
*  to that of FTX. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4685.24s)]
*  But for whatever reason, SBF had substantially more cash for donations, corporate buyouts, [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4686.64s)]
*  et cetera, being heralded in the media as the white knight of crypto in his All In podcast. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4691.72s)]
*  Shamath Palihapitiya also shared his own experience with Bankman Freed. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4697.56s)]
*  But instead of focusing on SBF, Shamath went deeper into the subject and believes there [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4701.56s)]
*  is a systemic issue at hand that needs to be dealt with immediately. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4706.3s)]
*  But before we listen to Shamath, if you're new to the channel or not subscribed, make [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4710.64s)]
*  sure you subscribe as we put out daily content to keep you updated on the current market [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4713.76s)]
*  and news. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4717.52s)]
*  There was an article that appeared that said that the head of compliance at FTX was also [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4718.52s)]
*  the head of compliance at a poker site called Ultimate Bet, which in the 2010s did this [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4723.54s)]
*  exact thing, apparently some version of this, where they went in and they looked at whole [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4729.78s)]
*  cards of poker players. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4734.26s)]
*  And then a few employees inside the business would basically play against these folks knowing [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4736.4s)]
*  what the whole cards were, ran this cheat, stole millions of dollars. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4740.46s)]
*  Somehow that person found a way to be head of compliance at FTX. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4745.74s)]
*  Ten years later. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4749.78s)]
*  This happens in the public markets a lot as well. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4750.78s)]
*  So like when you see heavily shorted names, or when you know that certain hedge funds [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4752.98s)]
*  are on the brink, other hedge funds will go in and essentially force a margin call and [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4757.179999999999s)]
*  a stop out because then it's what causes all of these runs. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4763.179999999999s)]
*  And if you look actually inside a GameStop, the reason why you got all this gamification [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4765.9s)]
*  in the GameStop equity and a bunch of these other names was in part because of this dynamic, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4770.339999999999s)]
*  folks that are highly levered, folks that don't have the right matching of risk. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4774.98s)]
*  And what happens is they're solvent but illiquid. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4780.9s)]
*  And then if you run the instrument into the ground, they both become insolvent and illiquid [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4785.96s)]
*  all at the same time. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4792.4s)]
*  To me, it seems the whole issue if you come back, like what is the first string that you [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4793.5s)]
*  pulled that unraveled the sweater was the fact that these tokens were created out of [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4796.86s)]
*  thin air. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4801.58s)]
*  They had no meaningful value. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4802.7s)]
*  Somebody prescribed a value and all of a sudden, everybody else in the economy all of a sudden [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4804.599999999999s)]
*  said, yeah, I'll take that as collateral. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4809.139999999999s)]
*  You cannot do that in the regular world. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4811.5s)]
*  I can't call JP Morgan and say, I've invented this thing. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4813.179999999999s)]
*  It's called a share in XYZ. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4816.74s)]
*  And I'd like you to margin loan, give me a loan against it. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4819.3s)]
*  I think the problem is bigger than FTX. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4822.179999999999s)]
*  And I'll say the uncomfortable part out loud and nobody needs to necessarily comment if [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4824.94s)]
*  you don't want to. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4829.7s)]
*  But there were an enormous number of venture firms that hawked their way into just completely [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4831.099999999999s)]
*  doing zero work here. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4839.2s)]
*  I mean, and the the tip of the spear is this thing. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4841.0s)]
*  Well, who's the guy that works at Founders Fund? [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4845.04s)]
*  Bulgar, Buljar, Zbuljar? [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4847.24s)]
*  Zbulgar? [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4850.88s)]
*  Delian. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4851.5199999999995s)]
*  Delian. Thank you. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4852.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4853.64s)]
*  That tweet that he had where he basically took the snapshot of the Sequoia transcript was [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4854.64s)]
*  one of the funniest things that I've ever seen. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4859.4s)]
*  I mean, this was a two hundred and fifteen million dollar decision and Sequoia documented [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4861.88s)]
*  it and put it on their own website. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4867.22s)]
*  And I think that's an example of something that was happening, which is people just looked [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4869.84s)]
*  the other way and didn't even want to do the layer of work. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4873.76s)]
*  I just want to say the second uncomfortable thing out loud, which is there was a lot of [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4876.32s)]
*  venture firms in Silicon Valley in this period of both not doing any work or diligence who [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4880.4s)]
*  also took the extra step and actually created classes and would teach teams how to create [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4885.48s)]
*  these tokens. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4892.72s)]
*  OK, and those artifacts, those video links and artifacts are sometimes on their website. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4894.44s)]
*  They're still on YouTube. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4899.32s)]
*  They're inside of Twitter. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4900.44s)]
*  And what these folks would do when we talked about this, the game that they played was [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4902.0s)]
*  they would get a team, they would create a token, they would also buy equity at some [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4906.32s)]
*  crazy valuation. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4911.679999999999s)]
*  The equity was locked up, but the tokens were not. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4913.959999999999s)]
*  And then they would put them on an exchange and sell them to unsuspecting people and they [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4917.679999999999s)]
*  would be able to dump these tokens. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4921.919999999999s)]
*  And if you look inside of that trend, what you're going to see, and Brian just mentioned [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4924.2s)]
*  this, those were the sale of securities, except it was done in a completely unregulated way. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4930.32s)]
*  That's it. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4935.719999999999s)]
*  Fucking criminals, criminals. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4937.32s)]
*  That explains it in a way that neither you nor I could ever repeat. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4938.679999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure how he said it, but I think he's an expert. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4943.44s)]
*  It's a Ponzi scheme. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4947.04s)]
*  It's all bullshit. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4948.2s)]
*  They were stealing people's money. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4949.0s)]
*  They jacked up the value of it. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4950.36s)]
*  They used these celebrities to endorse it, which gave it value and the cult of personality. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4952.04s)]
*  We all followed along and a lot of sheep bought a lot of money and bought this bullshit explanation. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4957.24s)]
*  You were intimidated into not being able to critique it. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4961.64s)]
*  It was basically the trans women are women of money. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4964.76s)]
*  They go, Bitcoin is money. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4968.84s)]
*  And you're going to explain that to me. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4970.36s)]
*  And they go, stop asking for an explanation. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4971.48s)]
*  Respect Bitcoin's preferences. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4974.04s)]
*  It wants to be money. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4977.32s)]
*  So address it as money. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4979.16s)]
*  And they just yelled at you if you were like, hey, I don't understand it. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4981.56s)]
*  Well, also money was being exchanged and money was exchanging hands. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4984.36s)]
*  So they knew they could get some of that money. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4990.36s)]
*  So of course they're going to have classes and teach people how to make those tokens. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4992.52s)]
*  As long as it's legal. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4995.08s)]
*  That's what they do. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4996.2s)]
*  They would actually be doing a disservice to their customers if they didn't do that. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=4997.24s)]
*  They make money. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5003.96s)]
*  That's what they do. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5004.92s)]
*  You can make money this way. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5005.64s)]
*  It's real money. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5006.76s)]
*  You just got to move it around. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5007.8s)]
*  It's real money. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5009.4s)]
*  It's real money. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5010.44s)]
*  And what you're buying is not real. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5011.4s)]
*  It ain't real. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5013.08s)]
*  It ain't real. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5013.719999999999s)]
*  There's nothing there. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5014.2s)]
*  The money's real. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5014.919999999999s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5016.12s)]
*  But they sold everyone on the idea that the tokens will be worth more than the real thing. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5018.5199999999995s)]

*  That's what he was sort of explaining. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5119.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5121.56s)]
*  But the other stuff is the different stuff. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5121.8s)]
*  That's this. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5124.92s)]
*  But what I'm talking about is the. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5125.5599999999995s)]
*  This is how it gets into this. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5126.84s)]
*  So this company FTX was backed by something separate, which I think [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5127.96s)]
*  Chumath explains in another video and says why these aren't supposed to happen. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5132.2s)]
*  But he was like, well, I guess this is what you guys are doing. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5136.12s)]
*  I think that company FTX was the second biggest donor to the Democrat Party. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5138.12s)]
*  Alameda Research. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5144.04s)]
*  The first biggest company was is Alameda Research, [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5145.96s)]
*  the sister company that they funneled the 10 billion to. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5149.48s)]
*  That's what. Yeah. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5151.639999999999s)]
*  So that's the company they funneled the 10 billion to. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5152.6s)]
*  They were the second biggest next to George Soros. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5155.08s)]
*  He's number one. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5158.4400000000005s)]
*  They're the second biggest donor to the Democrat Party. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5159.400000000001s)]
*  That's dirty ball. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5162.120000000001s)]
*  Well, that's something. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5164.120000000001s)]
*  I mean, maybe you're like a hardcore lefty and you really want the Democrats to win. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5166.4400000000005s)]
*  And this is your way of going about it. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5169.88s)]
*  Well, they if this is true, then it warrants a critique at the very least. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5171.56s)]
*  I'll just say that I don't know the truth of all of this, [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5179.400000000001s)]
*  but this has been like people are using this as information that is fact online. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5182.12s)]
*  So what is this saying here? [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5186.2s)]
*  Sam, who's the guy that was running this FTX. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5188.12s)]
*  His mom, right? [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5190.76s)]
*  His mother is a huge Democratic fundraiser. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5191.72s)]
*  She runs something called or a co-founder of Mind the Gap [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5195.64s)]
*  and the Get Out the Vote Organization. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5199.8s)]
*  Including the Center for Voter Information launches the FTX crypto exchange. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5202.68s)]
*  This is the timeline here. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5208.2s)]
*  April 21st for excuse me, 5th. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5210.5199999999995s)]
*  This is Joe Biden announces his presidential campaign and 13 days later, he starts FTX [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5213.48s)]
*  and then gets a bunch of money that no one really can explain. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5219.24s)]
*  And then starts giving it to the like they start spending it on campaigns and backing [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5224.12s)]
*  people and doing all sorts of things. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5230.04s)]
*  So through FTX, somehow or another, the allegation is that it's funding [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5231.96s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5237.719999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5238.679999999999s)]
*  And then that's why I didn't I haven't read through that whole article of like [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5238.84s)]
*  they said that this money then went to Ukraine in some way and then has now through some backdoor [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5241.88s)]
*  channels been put back into some people's hands. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5247.08s)]
*  And that's where it's getting it's getting lost in an exchange. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5249.88s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5253.24s)]
*  Well, this is what we're talking about on the phone over here, Mr. Poppice. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5254.84s)]

*  Isn't he? [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5280.92s)]
*  Why did I think that he passed away? [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5282.6s)]
*  Did he pass away? [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5285.64s)]
*  No, it doesn't seem that way. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5288.52s)]
*  I conflated him with some other. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5291.32s)]
*  He's 80. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5293.56s)]
*  80. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5294.4400000000005s)]
*  Maybe that's why. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5294.84s)]
*  There's another one of them hardcore guys. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5295.88s)]
*  I know Rush Limbaugh died, but someone else died too like that. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5297.32s)]
*  But that guy, he's a hardcore. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5301.64s)]
*  Imus? [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5304.28s)]
*  Imus died too. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5304.84s)]

*  I never met him. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5311.0s)]
*  He's an odd duck because he's kind of like back in his day, the early, early days, [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5312.2s)]
*  he was like another sort of kind of stern like character. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5317.88s)]
*  He was like this outrageous stern like character. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5322.6s)]
*  And then Howard Stern just did it way better and did his own version of it. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5326.04s)]
*  I think they were kind of simultaneously existing as like pioneers. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5331.08s)]
*  I don't think Imus gets the kind of credit because Stern was so good. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5337.16s)]
*  Stern was the best. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5340.4400000000005s)]
*  That show was the best. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5341.24s)]

*  Maybe if they turned off their greedy fucking hat for one second [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5542.12s)]

*  Next Exim. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5573.88s)]
*  What they did, what he did with the Seagram's daughters, [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5574.76s)]
*  they funneled all the money into his little cult. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5577.24s)]

*  legitimacy and then other people going like, it must be legitimate if this person's in it. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5586.360000000001s)]
*  And they started giving them all the money. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5590.76s)]
*  And all he was doing was branding women and fucking them. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5592.12s)]
*  What did they think he was doing, though? [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5595.8s)]
*  They thought he was doing this self-help thing and empowering women and, [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5597.24s)]
*  and, you know, teaching them how to be more rigorous and teach them. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5600.76s)]
*  Very ignorant to this cult. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5605.64s)]
*  Oh, it's incredible. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5606.84s)]
*  When I found out it was involving Hollywood people, I was like, [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5607.88s)]
*  I just gave up on that. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5611.08s)]
*  The actress from Smallville, there was a few other people. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5612.280000000001s)]
*  But it was all over the world. It wasn't just LA. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5615.56s)]
*  And it was based in Albany. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5617.4800000000005s)]
*  First of all, that's how you know people are stupid. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5618.360000000001s)]
*  Because if you're buying into a cult that's in Albany, you're stupid. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5620.360000000001s)]
*  And then they went to Albany to attend his little weekend retreats. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5627.24s)]
*  It's a bad place to live. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5630.76s)]
*  It's Albany. It's a shithole. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5631.72s)]
*  People from Albany are mad at you right now. Do you understand that? [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5634.2s)]
*  Well, they know I'm right, though. It's a dump. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5636.52s)]
*  It's the fucking capital of the state of New York, you son of a bitch. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5638.6s)]
*  Yeah, I know. And I don't know why. It's a shithole. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5641.64s)]
*  It's a fucking dump. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5648.6s)]
*  But they did the same exact thing that these crypto people did, [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5650.04s)]
*  specifically this kid Fried. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5653.0s)]
*  It's definitely not the Bahamas. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5654.360000000001s)]
*  It's not the Bahamas. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5655.56s)]
*  Right. He got it right. The kid got it right. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5656.4400000000005s)]
*  He got the billions. He's like, Bahamas. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5658.52s)]
*  That is a pretty wild thing to do, though. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5662.92s)]
*  To be living in a house, banging all these people you're working with, [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5665.240000000001s)]
*  raking in billions, funneling some of it to the Democratic Party, [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5668.76s)]
*  doing all this philanthropy work, [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5672.76s)]
*  probably thinking you're a fucking gem of a person. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5674.52s)]
*  Until it all comes crashing down. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5677.080000000001s)]
*  But if it didn't come crashing down, that's like the Bernie Madoff thing. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5678.280000000001s)]
*  If it wasn't for the 2008 crash, [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5681.72s)]
*  would Bernie Madoff have been able to keep that hustle going? [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5683.56s)]
*  Oh, he was so good at it. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5685.8s)]
*  He was so good. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5687.160000000001s)]
*  Oh, he was so good. He used to show up at his client's son's baseball games [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5687.8s)]
*  and answer their phone calls. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5691.8s)]
*  And of course he did. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5693.320000000001s)]
*  He really was a good con artist. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5694.68s)]
*  Of course he did. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5696.68s)]
*  He showed great attention to them, so they didn't look at the stealing hand. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5697.24s)]
*  But you know, the Democratic Party should have done a little due diligence. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5704.04s)]
*  Been like, what is this? [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5707.32s)]
*  They didn't ask questions either. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5708.599999999999s)]
*  Or not. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5709.8s)]
*  They just took the money. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5710.28s)]
*  They took the money. It's not their fault. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5711.24s)]
*  What the fuck are they supposed to do? [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5713.08s)]
*  If this lady set it up with her son and he's fucking funneling that money, [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5714.84s)]
*  yeehaw, let's go. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5718.12s)]
*  You don't have to go and do an audit on their business [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5719.24s)]
*  and make sure it's running right. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5721.16s)]
*  Give me that money. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5722.12s)]

*  How many people are coming to see Yannis Papas that are secretly coke dealers? [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5728.12s)]
*  I would say probably zero percent. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5732.12s)]
*  More than one. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5734.6s)]

*  I'm not claiming to be good. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5747.16s)]
*  We're just accepting a little money. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5748.360000000001s)]
*  We don't have time. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5749.64s)]
*  We're running a campaign. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5750.2s)]

*  Come on, man. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5753.8s)]
*  We're trying to codify Roe v. Wade. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5754.2s)]
*  We need money. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5756.28s)]
*  That's what I love when they turned over Roe v. Wade. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5756.92s)]
*  The first thing they did is, give us money. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5758.679999999999s)]
*  Give us more money. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5760.28s)]

*  Yeah, this article says that they used him like Greta Thunberg. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5765.8s)]
*  Oh, like Greta Thunberg, the teenage eco evangelist SBF [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5769.32s)]
*  was manipulated into serving a useful purpose. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5773.8s)]
*  Isn't that kind of editorializing though? [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5776.599999999999s)]
*  Could be. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5778.28s)]
*  You don't exactly know what was going on there. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5778.76s)]
*  In other words, FBF's analytical IQ and social ineptitude [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5780.36s)]
*  made him a prime recruit for the cause of hijacking capitalism [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5783.88s)]
*  to divert money to left-wing causes. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5787.4800000000005s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5790.12s)]
*  He was nerd sniped. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5790.62s)]
*  So the article describes Bankman Fried's recruitment [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5792.12s)]
*  into the EA cult when he was a young man at MIT [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5796.28s)]
*  as being nerd sniped, which is the practice of attracting [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5799.56s)]
*  brain power by presenting problems as puzzles. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5803.16s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5806.84s)]
*  EA is effective altruism for those- [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5807.32s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5809.4800000000005s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5811.400000000001s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5811.9s)]

*  Go back to that. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5816.86s)]
*  It says he's never read a book as information should be in six paragraph blog post. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5818.219999999999s)]
*  What? [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5824.94s)]
*  It says the author concludes the FTF founder is neurodiverse, [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5825.44s)]
*  but not spectrumy or Asperger E. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5829.179999999999s)]
*  SBF says he has some ADD and has never read a book [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5832.299999999999s)]

*  Huh. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5843.02s)]
*  He should probably read books. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5843.9800000000005s)]
*  Sounds like a typical Gen Z-er. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5845.820000000001s)]
*  He should read books on what happens when you start a sex cult. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5848.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5850.9400000000005s)]
*  It always ends up with dead people. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5851.42s)]
*  When is a sex cult? [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5856.3s)]
*  Unless the government comes in with the Nixxiom, how do you say it? [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5857.5s)]
*  Nixxiom, right? [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5860.62s)]
*  Unless they come in and fucking arrest everybody, it winds up in death. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5861.58s)]
*  Yeah, it does. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5864.62s)]
*  Always. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5865.58s)]
*  Look at Waco. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5866.06s)]
*  Branding, yeah. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5866.94s)]
*  What's next? [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5869.179999999999s)]
*  You got to give me your pinky? [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5870.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, no, you're going to kill him. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5871.0199999999995s)]
*  People die of infections? [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5871.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5872.7s)]
*  Yeah, so he cleaned his dirty money by donating it to the Democratic Party. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5875.5s)]
*  Or they tricked him into doing that. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5879.58s)]
*  They tricked him into funneling money over there. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5882.299999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is a fascinating unfolding thing, right? [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5884.379999999999s)]
*  Because they're monitoring him in the Bahamas. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5889.179999999999s)]
*  How long before they arrest him? [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5891.099999999999s)]
*  And if they said his plane went to Argentina, [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5893.0199999999995s)]
*  but he said no, he didn't go to Argentina. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5895.42s)]
*  But his private jet went to Argentina. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5897.34s)]
*  So what's on the jet, man? [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5899.26s)]
*  What's on the jet, man? [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5901.34s)]
*  I tell you what, it's not invisible tokens. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5903.1s)]
*  Maybe they put the jet over there so that they wouldn't take his jet. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5905.66s)]
*  Maybe they won't take it in Argentina. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5910.22s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5911.9800000000005s)]
*  Supposedly they were trying to get to Dubai, which Dubai's like, come on, [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5912.54s)]
*  give me some of that. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5916.22s)]
*  Give me some money, I'll keep you safe. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5916.86s)]
*  Yeah, money. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5918.78s)]
*  It's not going to be hoarding invisible tokens, I know that, because they are valueless. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5919.34s)]
*  It seems like now it's gotten so big, though, he probably can't hide anywhere. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5923.34s)]
*  It seems like they're going to get him. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5927.42s)]
*  Are they, though, or are they his friend because he helped them win? [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5929.1s)]
*  He knows too much. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5932.46s)]
*  He knows too much. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5933.58s)]
*  Yeah, you got to go down. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5934.46s)]
*  Yeah, he's got to fall off a boat. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5935.34s)]
*  Something's got to go wrong. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5937.74s)]
*  Yeah, you can't just get away with that. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5939.1s)]
*  They're not going to let you go to Dubai. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5940.9400000000005s)]
*  Not now. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5942.860000000001s)]
*  He's going to mysteriously fall off a boat. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5943.58s)]
*  How many people are involved that lost millions? [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5945.66s)]
*  Like, how many people? [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5948.9400000000005s)]
*  A lot of ordinary people lost a lot of money. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5950.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5952.06s)]
*  His Twitter account the last day has just been tweeting out random things like what, [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5952.78s)]
*  and then I think they got deleted. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5957.58s)]
*  It's not showing up. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5960.22s)]
*  So is he saying a sentence with all those H-A-P-P-E, what happened? [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5961.0199999999995s)]
*  No one knows. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5968.3s)]
*  Oh, did he get to the last letter? [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5969.18s)]
*  Stopped two hours ago. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5970.94s)]
*  So it's probably like what happened. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5972.14s)]
*  That's what I'm guessing. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5974.3s)]
*  Over time, though. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5975.26s)]
*  I don't know if he has it, because he could have his phone while he's being held, right? [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5976.7s)]
*  Who knows, man? [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5979.66s)]
*  Who knows what's going on? [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5980.46s)]
*  It could be that the party in power knew what he was doing, took the money, [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5982.62s)]
*  and then waited until after the elections to let the story drop. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5989.26s)]
*  That would be convenient, too. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5993.0199999999995s)]
*  Be like, all right, let's just take the money because we know it's going to help. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5994.22s)]
*  And then if we pull off what we're trying to pull off, which is less damage in the midterms, [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=5997.66s)]
*  then we'll take them down and pretend like we didn't know anything about it. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6002.62s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6007.0199999999995s)]
*  Because there's no way they didn't know anything about it. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6007.9s)]
*  Wouldn't it be better if they didn't take him down? [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6008.78s)]
*  He kept doing this forever. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6010.78s)]
*  And then they keep getting money funneled to him. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6012.62s)]
*  I think. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6014.46s)]
*  But now everybody knows. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6014.94s)]
*  Yeah, now. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6016.219999999999s)]
*  But I don't think they sold him down the river. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6017.0199999999995s)]
*  I think it probably just fell apart. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6019.259999999999s)]
*  I'm just guessing. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6022.0599999999995s)]
*  What is the reason why it fell apart? [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6023.42s)]
*  Yeah, that's why. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6025.099999999999s)]
*  Something happened. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6027.259999999999s)]
*  We're too dumb for this. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6028.0599999999995s)]
*  We're too dumb for this. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6029.259999999999s)]
*  I was trying to track it back, too. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6030.3s)]
*  So there is, I think, she's the CFO. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6032.0599999999995s)]
*  She's in the polycule, if you will. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6034.86s)]
*  Someone tweeted out something about purchasing them or something, [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6037.5s)]
*  and it was almost in a shit-talking response. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6040.7s)]
*  She's like, oh yeah, we'll just buy you. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6042.86s)]
*  We'll buy all your shares or something like that for $22. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6045.0199999999995s)]
*  We have money. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6047.9s)]
*  I think someone was calling them out for not having money or something like that. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6049.0199999999995s)]
*  And she called back, like, no, we do. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6051.5s)]
*  We'll do it. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6053.26s)]
*  And there's speculation that that guy knew all of this information or a good portion of it [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6054.46s)]
*  and was sort of baiting them out in public. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6058.22s)]
*  And now that it's out there, they can't put the plug back in. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6060.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6065.26s)]
*  Eventually, they all get caught in me. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6066.62s)]
*  If you're robbing Peter to play PayPal, eventually it gets found out. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6068.0599999999995s)]
*  In that crypto world, it seems like it's much more ambiguous where everything is. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6072.38s)]
*  Where does it go? [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6077.0199999999995s)]
*  And what is it? [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6077.74s)]
*  It's tokens, it's coins, it's this, it's that. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6078.38s)]
*  But once the value started dropping, there was a big crash, right? [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6083.259999999999s)]
*  I mean, it still has some value, but there was a big crash, right, Jamie? [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6087.179999999999s)]
*  Like, is that what started it off? [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6090.219999999999s)]
*  I think the big crash is what got everyone sort of focused on it [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6091.9s)]
*  and going like, wait a second, is this all bullshit? [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6095.42s)]
*  I don't know that this has much to do with Bitcoin specifically, [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6098.3s)]
*  other than that this is a crypto exchange. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6101.26s)]
*  I think that's the only relation to the Bitcoin price. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6104.3s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6107.42s)]
*  Well, thank goodness for that gentleman whose video we played. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6108.06s)]
*  Was his name Chamath? [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6111.1s)]
*  Say his last name again? [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6112.22s)]
*  No, not, no. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6113.1s)]
*  Do it. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6113.82s)]
*  He was a big wig at Facebook, right? [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6114.14s)]
*  Say his name, bro. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6116.46s)]
*  Chamath. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6117.42s)]
*  He's just known as Chamath. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6117.9s)]
*  Chamath. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6118.78s)]
*  Well, Chamath broke it down for us in a way that, again, we'll never be able to repeat. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6119.26s)]
*  And he's legit. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6122.86s)]
*  He used to be a top guy at Facebook, I think, if I'm right, right? [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6123.66s)]
*  I think he's definitely on the board of quite a few major companies. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6127.9s)]
*  He's involved in some venture capital. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6131.82s)]
*  So there's a leak about Alameda Research's money. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6135.339999999999s)]
*  This is sort of what I was getting at, I think. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6137.82s)]
*  And this sort of spread into more issues. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6139.42s)]
*  Like, they were hacked on Saturday night. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6144.0599999999995s)]
*  There was a tweet going out that told everyone to delete this off of your phone and devices. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6145.66s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6150.0599999999995s)]
*  I was like, oh, great. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6150.94s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6151.98s)]
*  And that's where that $1 to $2 billion was getting stolen, apparently. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6153.5s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6156.7s)]
*  And they're trying to check where that stuff was going. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6158.7s)]
*  So what does this have to do with Ukraine, though? [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6161.179999999999s)]
*  So they were using the money to give money to Ukraine to buy weapons? [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6163.179999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6168.46s)]
*  I think some of this is getting caught up in a conspiracy stuff. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6168.7s)]
*  The conspiracy was that the government was giving money to Ukraine to aid in the war, [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6171.58s)]
*  and that they were taking some of that money and investing it back in FTX. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6176.139999999999s)]
*  Oh. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6179.74s)]
*  Well, that could be true or not, right? [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6181.259999999999s)]
*  We don't know. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6182.62s)]
*  Let's see what we know. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6183.58s)]
*  Yes, I'm just Googling. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6184.54s)]
*  Don't give up now. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6185.58s)]
*  We're almost there. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6187.34s)]
*  We've almost figured this mystery out. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6189.42s)]
*  So Axios says there's two threads, untangling two threads about FTX and user funds. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6191.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't know if this is going to be in here, though. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6196.86s)]
*  Money is a wild thing, brother. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6198.86s)]
*  It's a wild thing that motivates people. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6201.26s)]
*  And Ukraine doesn't pop up in that article. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6203.26s)]
*  Wild, wild thing. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6205.98s)]
*  It is. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6207.58s)]
*  That dude, if he just played it right, if he just played it right, he'd be rich as fuck. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6208.14s)]
*  Banging nine people in a house in the Bahamas. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6212.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6214.54s)]
*  I mean, here's a for instance. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6214.78s)]
*  They never stopped, though, right? [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6215.82s)]
*  He tweeted this on February 24th. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6216.78s)]
*  We just gave $25 to each Ukrainian on FTX. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6218.3s)]
*  Do what you got to do. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6222.38s)]
*  It's like, what does that mean? [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6225.5s)]
*  They start an account for every person in Ukraine on their platform, [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6226.7s)]
*  and then how many of them actually access that? [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6229.26s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6232.38s)]
*  The worst people always hide behind the greatest good. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6233.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6236.78s)]
*  There's definitely an inclination for things to be co-opted. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6237.58s)]
*  Things that are undeniably good things co-opted by evil people with their own selfish needs. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6242.46s)]
*  It's the best cover. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6247.9s)]
*  It's a great cover, sure. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6249.42s)]
*  Especially if you're actually funneling money and deciding that the only way to help is to do this, [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6250.86s)]
*  and we're going to donate that. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6257.1s)]
*  It'll justify this. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6258.14s)]
*  And even though it's kind of shady, we're going to get away with it because we've got [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6259.26s)]
*  the backing of these people. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6261.82s)]
*  And I don't know that this means there's proof, but this is a... [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6262.94s)]
*  FBF laundering money through Ukraine. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6265.42s)]

*  Could be. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6279.9800000000005s)]

*  Moushegian moved to Florida in 2017 to focus on the crypto scene. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6547.34s)]

*  Many believe his death was no accident, while those in the crypto called him brilliant but [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6631.1s)]
*  paranoid. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6635.66s)]
*  Another person who knew Moushegian very well for years until they had a falling out two [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6636.46s)]

*  He had mental problems, the source said. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6648.3s)]
*  He saw a psychiatrist at times. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6650.54s)]
*  He smoked a lot of pot, a tremendous amount. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6652.46s)]
*  Some of his paranoia was based on fact, the source said. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6655.5s)]

*  He knew things. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6660.94s)]
*  Nikolai got bored a lot with the mundane of life. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6662.14s)]
*  He'd go after things, constantly putting himself in weird positions. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6666.700000000001s)]
*  If it wasn't for money, it wasn't for the money rather. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6671.34s)]
*  He was interested in why things were the way they were and the corruption behind it. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6674.54s)]
*  Meanwhile, other sources, including his family, believe the drowning was neither accidental [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6678.860000000001s)]
*  nor the result of foul play, hinting that it was self-inflicted. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6683.34s)]
*  Moushegian had been in such a downward spiral in recent weeks that his father had come to [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6687.5s)]

*  So they don't know. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6701.02s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, his mother said that his death had nothing to do with conspiracy tweets. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6702.78s)]
*  Well, maybe she knows them better. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6710.7s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6713.18s)]
*  It's a fucking crazy coincidence, though. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6714.54s)]
*  But it's also one of those things, like if you were a troll and you knew you were going [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6717.74s)]

*  If you're one of those people that's inclined to believe that Q is a real person, [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6833.66s)]
*  and then this kind of stuff happens, that was the whole thing behind Q, right? [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6836.860000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump was going to expose the pedophiles, [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6840.38s)]

*  Yeah, he was going to Star Trek up from the spot that his dad died. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6845.58s)]
*  How crazy is that that they thought that JFK Jr. was a part of it all? [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6851.58s)]
*  They were still alive this whole time, just under the radar, [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6854.7s)]
*  ready to pop up decades later to save Trump. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6857.18s)]
*  It's like adult fan fiction. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6860.9400000000005s)]
*  It's like adult Dungeons and Dragons. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6862.54s)]
*  Cosplay. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6865.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's cosplay. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6866.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's exciting. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6867.42s)]
*  It's a much more exciting life when you know a dangerous, dangerous secret. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6870.38s)]
*  When you're in on something. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6875.9800000000005s)]
*  It's better than just eating soup and Panera Bread, [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6877.18s)]
*  and maybe the person knows your name. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6879.18s)]
*  Watching the Big Bang. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6880.780000000001s)]

*  And just chuckling every couple episodes. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6882.860000000001s)]
*  As your neck fetches grows and grows into a bubble. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6884.7s)]
*  Your liver just gets toxic. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6888.94s)]
*  It's better to be James Bond. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6890.78s)]
*  Go to sleep drunk every night. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6892.46s)]
*  Yeah, digital James Bond. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6893.66s)]
*  And then you form camaraderie with other people. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6896.7s)]
*  Yeah, you have this whole social scene, [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6899.34s)]
*  and you guys are all in on this dangerous secret. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6901.42s)]
*  But the truth probably lies in between that and that there's nothing going on. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6904.7s)]
*  Well, I also think that if I was running some sort of an illegal operation, [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6911.1s)]
*  one thing I would do is make it seem ridiculous. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6914.780000000001s)]
*  So I would hire people to go post outrageous stuff online [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6917.02s)]
*  to the point where none of it makes any sense anymore. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6920.780000000001s)]
*  Because it all seems so crazy. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6923.26s)]
*  If you believe in that, you believe in lizard people, [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6924.54s)]
*  and the earth is flat. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6926.620000000001s)]
*  And you know what I mean? [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6927.5s)]
*  I think there's something to that. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6928.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and the people who do run shit are sometimes evil geniuses, [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6930.46s)]
*  and they think of all those things. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6936.22s)]
*  And it's amazing. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6937.660000000001s)]
*  They always have the advantage, like the Joker. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6940.06s)]
*  They always have the advantage. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6942.22s)]
*  They always have the advantage. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6943.02s)]
*  Because they have the will, they want it. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6944.06s)]
*  When you get to people like George Soros and that other guy, [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6946.9400000000005s)]
*  the Klaus Schwab guy, the World Economic Forum guy. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6949.740000000001s)]

*  No. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6962.3s)]
*  That was a tweet the World Economic Forum put out. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6962.54s)]
*  I'm going to send you the tweet. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6965.580000000001s)]
*  The World Economic Forum sent this tweet out in like 2016. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6967.1s)]
*  And it's a picture of this girl. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6972.620000000001s)]
*  And it says, see if you can find it, Jamie. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6974.22s)]
*  It says the tweet was from 2016. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6976.780000000001s)]
*  It said you will own nothing and you'll be happy. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6979.26s)]

*  It's a real tweet that they put out in 2016. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6983.26s)]
*  And they put it out because of this thing from the World Economic Forum. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6986.620000000001s)]
*  I own nothing. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6992.38s)]
*  I have no privacy. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6993.1s)]

*  She's a member of parliament in Denmark. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=6997.58s)]

*  So this is a real tweet from 2016 from the World Economic Forum's Twitter account. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7011.02s)]
*  Imagine just saying that to people and putting that thought out there. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7015.660000000001s)]
*  And like, oh, great. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7018.700000000001s)]
*  Does that mean no one owns anything? [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7019.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, that doesn't make any sense. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7021.900000000001s)]
*  Then can everybody just have everything? [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7023.02s)]
*  Or does someone own something? [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7025.1s)]
*  Does the state own everything? [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7027.1s)]
*  And they tell you what you can have and what you can't have. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7028.62s)]

*  and they are mutually exclusive. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7036.38s)]

*  That's the way it goes. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7040.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7041.82s)]
*  And these are the people that are trying to promote the idea of eating bugs [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7042.14s)]
*  and no more meat. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7045.74s)]
*  This is all wild movie shit. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7048.14s)]
*  It is. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7050.54s)]
*  It is movie shit. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7051.26s)]
*  And they conveniently leave that part out [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7052.86s)]
*  because they're like, oh, you don't own or share it all. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7055.42s)]
*  Then like somebody, then that means the government owns it [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7059.1s)]
*  and they're distributing. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7062.38s)]
*  Then they own it. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7063.58s)]
*  So the people who are in the government, they have the advantage. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7064.22s)]
*  That's like, no, it's that utopian bullshit. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7067.02s)]
*  When people get into that utopian bullshit, [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7069.9800000000005s)]
*  it's always erroneous. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7073.9s)]
*  It's always going to be nefarious because it doesn't exist in reality. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7075.26s)]
*  You're not coming up with a solution in reality. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7080.3s)]
*  You're basing it on ideals and ideals don't exist. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7083.42s)]
*  You're also saying it when you're the World Economic Forum, Davos, [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7086.78s)]
*  where billionaires fly in to decide the fate of the civilization [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7093.18s)]

*  and they glue their hand to the wall [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7126.139999999999s)]
*  and they think they're going to fix the world. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7127.42s)]
*  Yeah. That was the age. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7128.94s)]

*  So fuck you. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7157.74s)]
*  Stay there. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7158.78s)]
*  You glued your hand to the floor. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7159.42s)]
*  We're not even going to call the cops. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7160.7s)]
*  Yeah. Just leave you there. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7161.82s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7162.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7163.42s)]
*  Leave them. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7164.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7164.7s)]
*  Leave them and eat that shitty German food. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7165.82s)]
*  Yeah. You're not winning any people over to your cause [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7167.58s)]
*  when you do dumb shit like that. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7170.78s)]
*  But they're all doing it. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7171.9s)]
*  It's happening left and right now. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7172.94s)]
*  It keeps happening over and over and over again. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7174.22s)]
*  People are doing it. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7175.98s)]
*  It's like now it's a trend. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7177.0199999999995s)]
*  So now they arrested people that were a part of an organization [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7178.62s)]
*  that were trying to go into a museum somewhere in Europe and do that. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7182.7s)]
*  Now they're catching them [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7186.38s)]
*  before they can actually get off the glue on the hand move. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7187.82s)]
*  It's a terrorist act. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7191.26s)]
*  It's fucking crazy. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7192.54s)]
*  It's a terrorist act. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7193.42s)]
*  To do that is terrorism. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7194.46s)]
*  To fucking attack an iconic painting is terrorism. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7195.58s)]
*  And they're saying they're doing it [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7200.3s)]
*  but they know that it won't ruin the painting [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7201.42s)]
*  because it's covered in glass. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7203.18s)]
*  You don't get to make that choice. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7204.22s)]
*  Right. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7205.26s)]
*  Not only that, how do you know how old that frame is? [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7205.58s)]
*  Do you know if that frame is historic as well? [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7208.3s)]
*  Do you know that? [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7210.62s)]
*  That frame might be a thousand years old. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7211.58s)]
*  Right. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7213.1s)]
*  You're throwing soup on a thousand year old frame. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7213.42s)]
*  Right. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7215.18s)]
*  Do you know? [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7215.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7216.54s)]
*  That's the equivalent of going assaulting a woman and being like, [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7217.66s)]
*  well, you know, she asked for it. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7220.86s)]
*  She'll be fine. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7222.14s)]
*  She wouldn't want it. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7223.34s)]
*  It's you're just- [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7224.06s)]
*  She's fine. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7224.9400000000005s)]
*  You're rationalizing it. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7225.82s)]
*  You're justifying it. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7226.78s)]
*  It's like you committed a terrorist crime. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7227.74s)]
*  You're doing it to further this cause that you probably have very little understanding of too. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7230.14s)]
*  Like if you really knew what you're saying, just stopping all oil. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7235.580000000001s)]
*  I had Bjorn Lomborg on the podcast the other day who- [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7239.34s)]
*  What is his official title? [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7245.740000000001s)]
*  He's written books in the environment but he's also- [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7248.06s)]
*  Is he a statistician? [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7250.620000000001s)]
*  What is his- [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7252.700000000001s)]
*  I'm finding out what his official thing is. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7254.860000000001s)]
*  Bjorn essentially was saying the way to save lives is not by everybody quitting oil. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7256.94s)]
*  The way to save lives is to get people out of poverty. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7262.139999999999s)]
*  The best way to get people out of poverty is to provide them with power and with industry. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7265.66s)]
*  The bunch of things that's going to raise these people that are dying of tuberculosis and malaria. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7271.34s)]
*  That would save a lot of people. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7276.22s)]
*  He's a Danish author, statistician, and president of the Think Tank Copenhagen Consensus Center. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7277.58s)]
*  His take wasn't that global warming and human beings contributing to it is not a problem. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7284.3s)]
*  He said it is a problem. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7290.14s)]
*  But if we stopped everything in the United States, it's a small percentage of what the [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7291.5s)]
*  world does and they're not going to stop it. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7295.1s)]
*  What we need to do is figure out how to get to these places that are particularly like [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7296.9400000000005s)]
*  the most horrible scenarios in terms of like people's chance to live a good life and try to [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7300.9400000000005s)]
*  elevate those people. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7307.82s)]
*  You'll have less pollution. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7309.1s)]
*  You'll have less problems. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7310.54s)]
*  You'll have less of this. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7311.66s)]
*  If you have less people that are living in dire poverty, they don't give a fuck about [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7312.86s)]
*  burning coal or some of these people burning paper to feed their homes or to warm their [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7316.86s)]
*  homes and to cook their food on. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7322.7s)]
*  He was saying that living inside these homes where these people do this is like the equivalent [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7325.5s)]
*  of smoking two packs of cigarettes a day for everybody who lives there. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7329.42s)]
*  They're just breathing toxic shit all the time. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7332.38s)]
*  Probably some truth to that too, but you can't let the corporations off the hook and rich [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7334.62s)]
*  people off the hook either. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7338.7s)]
*  All the companies that dumped chemicals in the Hudson River and do all that stuff, that's [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7340.38s)]
*  unregulated. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7345.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7345.82s)]
*  No, no one's saying that. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7346.0599999999995s)]
*  But what he is saying is that the real way to concentrate on helping people is increasing [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7347.0199999999995s)]
*  their capacity for education, getting them great education and raising industry in those [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7352.62s)]
*  areas where people can make a living and getting them out of these thatched roof houses and [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7358.46s)]
*  aluminum siding houses where they get destroyed every time storms go through, getting them [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7365.18s)]
*  to safe homes. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7369.740000000001s)]
*  Making life better for them and trying to improve the economic situation, he goes that's [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7372.62s)]
*  going to save way more lives than this is. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7377.58s)]
*  He thinks the solution is in technology to mitigate these problems, not just completely [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7381.02s)]
*  stopping oil. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7385.820000000001s)]
*  They have to come up with viable alternatives. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7386.700000000001s)]
*  We're too far down the road now anyway, so it's just unrealistic to be like, hey, let's [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7389.1s)]
*  just all go live off the land. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7393.18s)]
*  And plus, when you go to electric, you still need oil to power that, to power the grid. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7394.860000000001s)]
*  That's the dirty secret about electric cars. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7400.46s)]
*  People don't know that. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7402.06s)]
*  And tires are made of rubber and all the... [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7403.1s)]
*  There's so much that oil... [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7406.14s)]
*  You can't just go stop oil. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7408.14s)]
*  You got to figure it out somehow slowly. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7409.66s)]
*  Yeah, we got to get better the same way we got sick. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7411.9800000000005s)]
*  It's a gambling term. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7416.860000000001s)]
*  Say if you and I were gambling, we were playing pool and I won five games in a row and you [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7418.700000000001s)]
*  said like double or nothing. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7422.46s)]
*  I said, no, no, no. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7423.58s)]
*  You got to get better the same way you got sick. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7424.78s)]
*  You're five games down. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7427.34s)]
*  We're paying $100 a game and you want to bet $500 in the next game. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7429.58s)]
*  I'm like, no, no, no. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7433.02s)]
*  You got to get better the same way you got sick. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7434.22s)]
*  I'm not going to give you a chance to win it all back in one game. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7436.54s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7439.42s)]
*  And in life, if it takes this much time to pollute the ocean and this much time to ruin [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7440.46s)]
*  the streams and this much time to get all that carbon in the air, we probably should [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7446.7s)]
*  be looking at some long term solution that includes renewable energy, that includes all [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7451.34s)]
*  these things and then like slowly migrating in a safe way that doesn't fuck us economically. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7455.820000000001s)]
*  You're 100% right. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7460.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7462.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7462.46s)]
*  But in those countries, like it's imperative. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7463.26s)]
*  There's a lot of countries that are contributing the most to all this carbon that's in the [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7466.780000000001s)]
*  atmosphere. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7470.9400000000005s)]
*  China big time, right? [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7471.02s)]
*  Big time. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7472.06s)]
*  They're not going to stop. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7472.46s)]
*  They're not going to listen. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7473.42s)]
*  They're not going to listen. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7474.46s)]
*  So we're over here with like a small percentage of the world's problem and if we're still going [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7475.900000000001s)]

*  We're going to be funding all this pollution over there. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7483.18s)]
*  Right. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7485.42s)]
*  Well, they're kind of shooting themselves in the foot. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7485.9800000000005s)]
*  And I don't, it's one thing I don't understand why they keep doing the zero tolerance COVID [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7487.58s)]
*  lockdowns at the factories because that's just making American companies diversify where [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7492.62s)]
*  their factories are. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7497.1s)]
*  Isn't that hurting their pocket? [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7497.9s)]
*  I don't understand why they're doing it. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7499.34s)]
*  I don't get it. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7500.62s)]
*  People are wild, dude. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7501.42s)]
*  Is it just because they're authoritarian? [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7502.86s)]
*  I think that's it. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7504.54s)]
*  I think they just crack that whip on people. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7505.5s)]
*  They just can't get out of their own way in that way or something. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7508.14s)]
*  I mean, it seems to be a way of managing people. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7510.14s)]
*  That's very common, right? [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7514.14s)]
*  That authoritarian, zero tolerance way of treating people. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7515.900000000001s)]
*  That's how you keep people scared. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7523.660000000001s)]
*  And if you do that with tweets, like they do that with tweets. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7525.26s)]
*  Like if you tweet over there, you're fucked. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7528.780000000001s)]
*  If you tweet something shitty, you know, put out something on whatever their social media [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7530.54s)]
*  apps are, you're fucked. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7534.700000000001s)]
*  That's the case in Saudi Arabia too, right? [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7536.22s)]
*  You're fucked. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7538.38s)]
*  You tweet some shit about the government, you complain about the government, you're fucked. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7539.26s)]
*  You know, that's what they do. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7543.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7545.34s)]
*  You can't get away with it. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7545.5s)]
*  Well, they're fucking up the supply chain. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7546.46s)]
*  And the whole world is fucked right now in that way. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7548.38s)]
*  And that kind of that's going to make companies go like we're going to move our factory here [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7552.780000000001s)]
*  because they don't have those types of zero tolerance policies. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7558.14s)]
*  They're not shutting down like that. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7560.9400000000005s)]
*  We need to keep those trains moving. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7562.14s)]
*  People need their fucking iPhones. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7564.9400000000005s)]
*  Well, also- [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7566.3s)]
*  They need their upgrade. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7566.62s)]
*  We shouldn't be reliant upon all these other countries for everything we need because it's [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7567.9s)]
*  cheaper. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7572.46s)]
*  No. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7573.259999999999s)]
*  That seems dumb. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7573.5s)]
*  Well, we got sold out a long time ago, right? [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7575.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7577.5s)]
*  When we went overseas with the factories and sort of said fuck you to the American worker [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7577.82s)]
*  who wanted, you know, certain rights. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7581.34s)]
*  That's Roger and me. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7583.82s)]
*  That documentary Roger and me. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7584.78s)]
*  You see how devastating it was to all the communities around those car manufacturing plants. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7586.219999999999s)]
*  Money, man. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7591.0199999999995s)]
*  Fuck, dude. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7591.58s)]
*  What it does to people. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7591.66s)]
*  A little more, pad that bottom line a little more. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7592.62s)]
*  And, you know, that's sort of the flaw in our system. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7594.86s)]
*  But it's the best flaw. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7597.5s)]
*  It's the best. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7599.02s)]
*  I believe it's still- [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7599.74s)]
*  The best system. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7601.26s)]
*  The best system. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7601.98s)]
*  Yeah, not the best flaw. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7602.94s)]
*  It's like the least problem of all the problems that can be mitigated with a little bit of, [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7603.9s)]
*  I don't know, socialist temperance. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7610.06s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7613.82s)]
*  A little regulation. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7615.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7616.94s)]
*  Mixed economy seems to work pretty decently. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7617.18s)]
*  It seems like you need some sort of regulation, but you also need a healthy economy. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7620.14s)]
*  Because in a healthy economy, more people are making money, more jobs are available, [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7624.62s)]
*  and people do better. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7628.7s)]
*  For sure. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7629.74s)]
*  And people do better than economically. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7630.22s)]
*  If people are doing better, you would assume that would equate to probably less crime, [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7632.86s)]
*  less poverty, less problems. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7637.34s)]
*  You know, if we just concentrated on that. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7640.3s)]
*  More education, better education, less poverty. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7642.14s)]
*  That should be like the mandate for the country. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7645.74s)]
*  Fix all the problem cities. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7648.22s)]
*  Fix all the problems that are seriously economically disenfranchised. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7650.22s)]
*  Communities that have existed that way forever. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7653.98s)]
*  If they don't fix that, you're always going to have this gigantic fucking problem in this country. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7656.7s)]
*  The places that lost everything because of manufacturing, [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7661.259999999999s)]
*  maybe you could bring everything back. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7664.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, why not? [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7665.58s)]
*  Maybe it's possible. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7665.9s)]
*  Why not? [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7666.78s)]
*  It's not too late. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7667.5s)]
*  Bring it back. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7668.299999999999s)]
*  Look, they make a lot of shit in America already. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7668.94s)]
*  If we start making most of the stuff that we need, if we can be completely self-sustainable [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7671.419999999999s)]
*  on this continent, if shit goes sideways again, like it did during the lockdowns, [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7676.459999999999s)]
*  it wouldn't cause as much of a hiccup. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7681.419999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7682.78s)]
*  And if you're going to spend money, spend it on education. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7683.58s)]
*  Because Aristotle warned a long time ago, [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7686.86s)]
*  the future of a civilization depends on the education of citizens. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7688.9400000000005s)]
*  It's true. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7691.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, and the way we fund the public school system is all by property taxes. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7692.86s)]
*  It's very inequitable. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7696.78s)]
*  And that's not in anyone's interest in the bigger picture. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7698.22s)]
*  Public education should, in my opinion, be good no matter where you are, [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7703.74s)]
*  no matter how expensive or inexpensive the property is. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7707.74s)]
*  That should be a priority of your empire or civilization, whatever you want to call it. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7710.86s)]
*  We're an empire, let's just be honest. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7716.139999999999s)]
*  It should be a priority, a top priority that our citizens are fucking just as smart as Finnish kids, [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7717.58s)]
*  those fucking Finnish people. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7723.5s)]
*  But then there's the conspiracy theory. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7724.94s)]
*  The conspiracy theory is that our education system sucks on purpose [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7727.259999999999s)]
*  because it's good to have a bunch of people that don't know what the fuck is going on [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7732.46s)]
*  because those people are easier to control than people that are well educated and objective [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7735.98s)]
*  and analyze things and they're not as easy to fool. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7740.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7744.7s)]
*  You can trick people with certain narratives. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7745.34s)]
*  If you want to get elected, if you're in a place where people have to get elected, [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7748.22s)]
*  you need a lot of rubes. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7752.14s)]
*  People that are gullible. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7755.02s)]
*  You need a lot of people wearing red hats. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7756.06s)]
*  You need a lot of people that are fucking storming the Capitol. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7758.06s)]
*  You need a lot of people with flags hanging out of their pickup trucks. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7760.22s)]
*  You need a lot of rubes. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7763.66s)]
*  Right. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7764.9400000000005s)]
*  And there's stupid people on the other side too. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7765.42s)]
*  I'm not saying they're the only rubes. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7766.22s)]
*  Yeah, there's rubes on the other side as well. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7767.42s)]
*  There's plenty of rubes. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7768.54s)]
*  There's plenty of rubes on the other side that are yelling the loudest. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7769.34s)]
*  I would say that there's legitimacy to that. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7773.1s)]
*  To both of those things. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7775.900000000001s)]
*  And it's deep rooted in a flaw in our system, in democracy, but still the best system. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7776.38s)]
*  The best system. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7783.900000000001s)]
*  It's just like all systems, there's room for improvement. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7784.7s)]
*  It's just that because it's run by the government, they suck at everything. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7788.3s)]
*  They really are slow. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7792.7s)]
*  They suck at everything. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7793.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7794.62s)]
*  But that's just the only thing they're good at is the post office. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7794.860000000001s)]
*  Post office is pretty fucking good. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7797.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7798.7s)]
*  Not bad. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7799.18s)]
*  And they're good when they fund private companies to do shit. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7799.66s)]
*  The private companies do it pretty good. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7802.700000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7804.14s)]
*  They're good at that. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7804.46s)]
*  A lot of people critique that dance, but that dance seems to work pretty good in a lot of cases. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7805.18s)]
*  Imagine if you could make it super profitable to clean up Baltimore. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7809.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7812.3s)]
*  Super profitable. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7812.700000000001s)]
*  Do like one of them fucking no bid contracts that Hal Burton got over in Iraq. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7813.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7818.3s)]
*  Yeah, because look, at the end of the day, not to sound like an Ayn Rand objectivist, [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7819.18s)]
*  but we're basically selfish creatures. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7822.9400000000005s)]
*  We're self-interested, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7825.98s)]
*  It's a thing because it is what it is. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7830.219999999999s)]
*  And so if you can find a way to use that for good, if you can play on that for good, [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7832.54s)]
*  and capitalism is the best way to facilitate that, to say, hey, here's this good you can do, [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7837.419999999999s)]
*  and you'll get rich doing it. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7846.379999999999s)]
*  But then there's people that are like, but you know what? [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7847.82s)]
*  Socialism has never been given a chance. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7849.66s)]
*  It's been given plenty of fucking chances. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7851.82s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7853.5s)]
*  We ruined Cuba with the embargo. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7854.22s)]
*  Well, if it was a better system, it would have been able to withstand that. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7856.7s)]
*  That's what the fuck are you talking about? [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7859.42s)]
*  Well, also, they kind of were dictators over there, [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7861.02s)]
*  and they forced people into labor. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7863.9800000000005s)]
*  They forced people into doing things. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7865.5s)]
*  Here's my- [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7866.860000000001s)]
*  That's not a good example. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7867.5s)]
*  Cuba's not the best example when you talk to people that lived in Cuba. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7868.3s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7871.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7871.66s)]
*  Completely restrictive. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7871.820000000001s)]
*  You don't want a utopian culture like that. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7872.9400000000005s)]
*  And the idea is that that utopian culture is only that way because of the embargo. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7875.18s)]
*  That's just a guess. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7878.7s)]
*  Even if we didn't have the embargo with Cuba, if it's run by Castro, [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7880.3s)]
*  I guarantee you he's going to have a certain amount of control. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7883.82s)]
*  It's not like he put that control over the people just because of the embargo. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7886.46s)]
*  That's how that guy ran shit. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7890.22s)]
*  Well, this is the sort of the thorn in that, the idealism of socialism. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7891.58s)]
*  They're saying everyone will be equal, but what the reality is, [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7900.62s)]
*  is everyone will be all the same poor. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7904.3s)]
*  Because in order to be rich or well off, you have to be a capitalist. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7907.0199999999995s)]
*  So that's the truth. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7911.66s)]
*  And that's why socialism doesn't work. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7913.5s)]
*  And that's why if you look case in point, in reality, they're all fucking poor. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7914.94s)]
*  Guess who's not poor? [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7918.7s)]
*  The fucking guy in power. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7919.98s)]
*  He's never poor. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7921.34s)]
*  In any of the communist countries, you never see those guys walking around [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7922.7s)]
*  with no fucking shoes trying to get a baseball contract. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7925.82s)]
*  They're not, you know, Fidel Cash wasn't like, [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7928.62s)]
*  my only hope is to swim on a shoe and get a Yankee deal. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7930.62s)]
*  He was fine. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7934.86s)]
*  He had the best cigars. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7935.9s)]
*  He had the steak when he wanted. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7937.58s)]
*  And everybody else was eating their fucking shoes. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7939.34s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7941.5s)]
*  That's the reality. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7942.06s)]
*  And that's got nothing to do with the United States. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7943.34s)]
*  What if there's no embargo? [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7945.26s)]
*  What if they had free trade with Cuba? [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7946.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7948.06s)]
*  Well, what if my mother was my father, then she would have a dick? [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7948.3s)]
*  What the fuck are we talking about? [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7953.660000000001s)]
*  Those are people who don't live in the real world. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7956.46s)]
*  Like you said, aptly said, ask someone who lived there. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7958.06s)]
*  Well, talk to Joey. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7962.38s)]
*  Joey still has relatives over there in Cuba. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7963.9800000000005s)]
*  Joey's family came over here when he was young. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7966.860000000001s)]
*  And I know quite a few people that came from Cuba. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7969.42s)]
*  That talk about what it was like to try to escape, [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7973.5s)]
*  including Yoel Romero, who came on the podcast, [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7976.22s)]
*  and Joey translated for him. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7978.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7979.26s)]
*  Yeah, not good. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7980.3s)]
*  There's never been, it's never been done in a way that makes me say, [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7982.38s)]
*  hmm, that looks good. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7986.3s)]
*  It's always the quality of outcome is a dangerous situation [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7988.22s)]
*  because it has to be enforced. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7991.820000000001s)]
*  And there's the only way to enforce. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7993.660000000001s)]
*  And also people need motivation to do extreme things. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7995.26s)]
*  If Elon Musk wasn't worth $280 billion a year, [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=7999.42s)]
*  $280 billion, period, do you think he'd be willing to work 16 hour days [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8006.78s)]
*  and fucking sleep on the floor of the Tesla plant [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8010.86s)]
*  and in the same time run SpaceX at the same time, buy Twitter? [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8013.0199999999995s)]
*  That guy's a psycho. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8018.139999999999s)]
*  You need psychos. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8019.58s)]
*  You need people that are extremely driven [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8020.54s)]
*  because those are the ones that are innovators. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8023.259999999999s)]
*  They innovate. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8024.7s)]
*  They get things done. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8024.86s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8025.74s)]
*  They get things done that you and I are not going to get done. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8026.219999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8028.0599999999995s)]
*  If it's about sending civilization to Mars [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8028.86s)]
*  and creating high speed internet access through satellite [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8030.86s)]
*  all around the world and they're relying on Yanis Papas and Joe Rogan, [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8032.9400000000005s)]
*  we got a real fucking problem. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8035.82s)]
*  Right? [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8038.14s)]
*  We got a real problem. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8038.54s)]
*  And you need room for those people and you need room for overachievers. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8039.9800000000005s)]
*  And you also need room for people that just want to coast. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8043.34s)]
*  Nothing wrong with that. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8045.42s)]
*  You want to get a nice job working for the fucking garbage company [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8046.54s)]
*  and you just get up every morning, you're done by 9 a.m. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8050.62s)]
*  Fine. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8053.74s)]
*  You could do that too. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8054.62s)]
*  Maybe that's better for you. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8055.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8057.34s)]
*  But you got to have room for people to make choices. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8058.06s)]
*  And you got to have room. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8060.9400000000005s)]
*  That's what the problem with... [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8061.820000000001s)]
*  Yonmi Park talked about this recently. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8065.1s)]
*  See if you can find that. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8067.02s)]
*  There's a video, a speech that she gave recently [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8068.06s)]
*  where she talked about how coming from North Korea [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8070.9400000000005s)]
*  and what people call inequality in America, [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8074.06s)]
*  she thought was amazing because that meant you could work hard [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8076.54s)]
*  and you could get to this place of having wealth and happiness and prosperity [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8079.820000000001s)]
*  if you just did the right thing and worked hard. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8085.660000000001s)]
*  Whereas in North Korea, that was absolutely impossible. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8087.58s)]
*  She lived and escaped when she was 13 years old, [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8090.7s)]
*  the worst case scenario, a country that's literally starving their people [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8093.34s)]
*  and killing their people if they kill animals. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8098.22s)]
*  If you go and kill a cow and slaughter it, they'll kill you. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8101.58s)]
*  And they do it publicly, let everybody know. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8104.7s)]
*  You are completely under the control of the government [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8107.42s)]
*  and the way they did it was by telling people [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8110.54s)]
*  they were going to take over their farms [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8112.54s)]
*  because that way they were going to feed everyone. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8114.3s)]
*  They were going to control everything. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8115.98s)]
*  No, it went sideways, it always does. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8117.98s)]
*  Let's hear the speech. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8120.86s)]
*  Do you know how North Korea became how it is today? [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8122.94s)]
*  When Kim Il-sung came, he made one promise to North Korean people, [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8127.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm going to feed you rice and meat stew each meal [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8131.0199999999995s)]
*  and I'm going to get rid of all the inequality. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8137.1s)]
*  If I do that, why don't you give me all your land on all your rights? [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8140.46s)]
*  We wanted no inequality, so we gave our land, our rights to this one guy. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8145.9s)]
*  He took everything from us. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8151.82s)]
*  So whenever in America I came and people in Manhattan [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8153.82s)]
*  living in the best city in the world telling me passionately [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8157.98s)]
*  how America is so bad. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8161.82s)]
*  So I asked them, so what is so bad about America that you hate so much? [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8163.74s)]
*  And they say, you know what? [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8168.62s)]
*  We have inequality in this country. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8170.86s)]
*  That's amazing thing that you can rise to compare to other people. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8173.5s)]
*  The enemy is a poverty, not inequality. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8178.14s)]
*  That's some deep shit right there. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8182.78s)]
*  That's from a woman who suffered under the North Korean regime [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8183.9s)]
*  and escaped when she was 13. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8187.98s)]
*  She knows what the fuck she's talking about. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8189.5s)]
*  She knows what the fuck she's talking about. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8191.26s)]
*  When you talk to her about the harrowing story of her escaping to China [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8192.62s)]
*  and then eventually getting to America, like fuck. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8197.42s)]
*  That was very moving to watch. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8200.14s)]
*  It's true. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8202.539999999999s)]
*  When you elevate the group over the individual, [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8203.18s)]
*  inevitably the individual loses his rights. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8207.34s)]
*  And someone has to be in control of that. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8210.699999999999s)]
*  Because you can always justify anything you do for the group [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8212.06s)]
*  by sacrificing the individual. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8217.18s)]
*  Right. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8218.779999999999s)]
*  It's not like they're going to be good at this [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8219.18s)]
*  when they haven't been good at anything. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8221.1s)]
*  Like they're terrible at all this. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8223.1s)]
*  And if this is what they're doing with this FTX shit [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8225.1s)]
*  or whatever the fuck it is, FTX, I said that right? [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8227.66s)]
*  Like what other fucking shenanigans are going on with money and power? [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8231.099999999999s)]
*  How much shenanigans are involved totally? [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8235.58s)]
*  Until you're willing to take money out of politics, [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8238.779999999999s)]
*  we're never going to fix that. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8242.06s)]
*  That has to happen or else there'll be perpetual corruption. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8244.859999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8249.66s)]
*  Perpetual corruption. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8250.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8251.179999999998s)]
*  Thank God they're good at counting votes. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8253.179999999998s)]
*  They're so fast. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8254.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8255.82s)]
*  Well in certain states they're fast. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8256.539999999999s)]
*  No, no they're so fast. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8257.98s)]
*  Like Arizona, it's only been a week. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8259.42s)]
*  Remember when you used to know the night? [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8263.98s)]
*  Yes. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8265.5s)]
*  The night of the election? [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8265.9s)]
*  Yeah, now it takes a long time. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8267.1s)]
*  You know in Florida and you know in Texas [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8268.78s)]
*  and you know in a couple other spots like right away. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8271.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8274.220000000001s)]
*  But in Arizona, they're like, we don't know. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8275.02s)]
*  Right. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8277.26s)]
*  Still finding votes. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8277.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8278.86s)]
*  Still finding votes. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8279.26s)]
*  Yeah, that doesn't bode well. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8280.300000000001s)]
*  It's usually like are we starting to become a banana republic? [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8281.98s)]
*  We can't even fucking count votes. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8284.54s)]
*  Hey, you shouldn't even say that. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8285.5s)]
*  You shouldn't even question whether or not [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8287.66s)]
*  this voting is legitimate. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8290.460000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8291.740000000002s)]
*  You really shouldn't question election results [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8292.140000000001s)]
*  even though everybody does. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8293.820000000002s)]
*  Right. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8294.94s)]
*  Even though everybody does. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8295.34s)]
*  They all do. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8296.7s)]
*  Unfortunately they all do. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8297.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8298.460000000001s)]
*  They all do. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8298.7s)]
*  Every single one of them. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8299.18s)]
*  Hillary did. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8299.980000000001s)]
*  Trump did. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8300.62s)]
*  They all did. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8301.26s)]
*  They all do it. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8301.740000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8302.140000000001s)]
*  Remember they caught that lady who was the White House press secretary? [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8302.300000000001s)]
*  She questioned the results of the 2016 election. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8305.42s)]
*  She did it on Twitter openly and publicly. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8308.060000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8310.220000000001s)]
*  Some of that shit just sore loser shit too. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8311.5s)]
*  Stacey Abrams did it. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8313.18s)]
*  They all do it. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8314.220000000001s)]
*  They all do it. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8314.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8315.820000000002s)]
*  Didn't Hillary Clinton do it? [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8316.3s)]
*  They all do it. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8317.259999999998s)]
*  Hillary Clinton did it. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8317.74s)]
*  They all blame Russia and fucking all kinds of other shit. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8318.619999999999s)]
*  She called him an illegitimate president. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8321.58s)]
*  I mean I think that was she was doing it retroactively [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8323.179999999998s)]
*  but still it's no good. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8326.859999999999s)]
*  You can't do that. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8328.06s)]
*  Then people start to question everything. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8328.939999999999s)]
*  Obama didn't do that. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8330.939999999999s)]
*  No Obama. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8332.22s)]
*  When Trump won? [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8335.259999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8336.38s)]
*  I mean he carpet bombed the Middle East [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8336.779999999999s)]
*  but hey a lot of soldiers didn't die. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8338.38s)]
*  A little bit. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8340.859999999999s)]
*  He put American lives first. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8341.42s)]
*  Bunch of drone strikes. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8343.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8344.779999999999s)]
*  They weren't that accurate. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8345.019999999999s)]
*  They all do bad shit but I do it just to back up ideals for one thing. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8346.06s)]
*  Our country just to say something good about certain ideals. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8351.98s)]
*  Should we play the sound? [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8355.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8357.58s)]
*  Individual rights and rule of law is what we as Americans I think should always prioritize [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8357.98s)]
*  because that's what keeps the people in control [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8365.5s)]
*  and we should hold them all accountable no matter how powerful they are [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8368.06s)]
*  and we should always elevate the system over any individual. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8371.02s)]
*  What's been disconcerting to me is watching people start to worship individuals. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8374.3s)]
*  That's what we came here to avoid. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8379.42s)]
*  When they start following people, certain politicians as if they're kings [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8382.539999999999s)]
*  and no matter what they do they're beyond reproach. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8387.26s)]
*  That's not what we're about. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8389.82s)]
*  We're about critiquing them all and I say this as a jester [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8391.02s)]
*  whose job it is to make fun of fucking everybody including myself all the time [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8394.86s)]
*  to keep us humble and always, always strive for rule of law [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8399.34s)]
*  because you can't give anyone the benefit of the doubt over rule of law [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8403.9s)]
*  even if you love them or like them because once you do that [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8407.58s)]
*  you're opening it up for the devil to use that loophole that you created [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8410.62s)]
*  to get someone you thought was bad in order to wreak havoc. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8415.58s)]
*  Absolute fucking loophole. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8418.86s)]
*  You can't have blind allegiance towards a party and you don't even know the people. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8420.06s)]
*  You don't even know them. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8423.9s)]
*  You don't know them. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8425.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8426.22s)]
*  You haven't seen them turn into lizards when the moon is falling. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8426.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8428.78s)]
*  It's full. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8429.1s)]
*  They get in that special room in the middle of the White House. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8431.66s)]
*  There's that great scene though from A Man for All Seasons [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8435.5s)]
*  with St. Thomas More. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8438.7s)]
*  What is that? [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8440.140000000001s)]
*  Jamie can pull it up. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8441.74s)]
*  It's probably on YouTube. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8442.78s)]
*  It gives me chills every time I see it when I fucking watch it [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8444.380000000001s)]
*  but it's basically about that where some guys, [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8447.02s)]
*  he's in power and the guy's asking him to arrest this guy [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8449.42s)]
*  and he goes I'm not doing it. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8452.300000000001s)]
*  He didn't break the law and he's like but you know he did bad shit [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8453.18s)]
*  but he goes until he broke the law I want to arrest him [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8455.66s)]
*  and he goes why would you not do that? [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8457.98s)]
*  And then he goes because if I broke the law [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8462.779999999999s)]
*  and then you're trying to get this guy and I laid every fucking law flat. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8466.14s)]

*  He's a spy. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8472.14s)]
*  Father that man's bad. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8472.699999999999s)]
*  There's no law against that. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8473.74s)]
*  There is God's law. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8474.859999999999s)]
*  Then God can arrest him. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8475.82s)]
*  While you talk he's gone. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8477.1s)]
*  And go he should if he were the devil himself until he broke the law. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8478.38s)]
*  So now you'd give the devil benefit of the law. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8481.58s)]
*  Yes what would you do? [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8484.14s)]
*  Cut a great road through the law to get after the devil? [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8485.58s)]
*  Yes. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8487.82s)]

*  Oh and when the last law was down and the devil turned round on you [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8490.94s)]

*  Man's laws not God's and if you cut them down [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8501.02s)]
*  and you're just the man to do it [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8503.74s)]
*  do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8505.58s)]
*  Yes. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8510.94s)]
*  I give the devil benefit of law for my own safety's sake. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8512.06s)]
*  It's big picture thinking. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8516.38s)]
*  That's big picture thinking. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8517.58s)]
*  That's deep shit. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8518.86s)]
*  That is deep. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8519.82s)]
*  That's why the ACL supported Nazis. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8521.1s)]
*  Supported Nazis having the right to free expression. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8523.74s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8527.58s)]
*  You have to have freedom of speech absolutely. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8528.06s)]
*  Because as soon as you control it you tell people you can't say this [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8531.66s)]
*  or you can't say that then you've created this fucking moving line. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8534.22s)]

*  Election policing. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=8585.980000000001s)]

*  what would have been kids didn't make it i mean you know it's a violent process and before we [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=9575.419999999998s)]

*  new york and you get on you get on the train during rush hour and there's like a little [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10090.94s)]

*  about it and but the crazy thing is in dense populations they have the most strict gun laws [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10103.34s)]
*  and the most gun violence like chicago is crazy gun laws and a lot of fucking violence a lot of [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10107.34s)]
*  gun violence i think a lot of those guns come over state lines though you know they buy them in [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10113.42s)]
*  indiana and they move them across that's why if you're gonna have any sensible gun laws i think [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10118.06s)]
*  it would have to be uniform yeah but then you give them the federal government the the ability to [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10121.66s)]
*  dictate who does and doesn't have the ability to protect themselves the firearm i see that problem [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10126.78s)]

*  antiquated i felt like that was very dangerous and very stupid to say because the country's very [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10147.66s)]
*  different we're united states of america and the states are very different and i think a very good [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10154.06s)]
*  argument can be made that a lot of those states should have more of a say just because they don't [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10160.539999999999s)]

*  college provides those low population states a little bit more say and it keeps us united there's [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10187.98s)]
*  a strong argument to be made and for her to just wholesale call it antiquated is self-serving [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10192.779999999999s)]

*  a tree with a shotgun blast to his chest. [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10600.02s)]
*  What a way to kill yourself. [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10602.82s)]
*  It seems like one or the other would suffice. [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10603.82s)]
*  I don't know why you would hang yourself and then shoot yourself with a shotgun. [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10607.18s)]
*  You're going through a lot of trouble, man. [[02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10610.98s)]
*  That's a wild one. [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10612.66s)]
*  I didn't know about that and that one is what you call obviously wild. [[02:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10614.42s)]
*  That's out there. [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10619.94s)]
*  It's a little sus as the kids would say. [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10620.94s)]
*  That's sus, son. [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10622.539999999999s)]
*  That one is sus. [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10623.539999999999s)]
*  That's one of the most sus things I've ever heard. [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10625.86s)]
*  That's one of like 50 of those stories. [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10628.74s)]
*  That one's real sus. [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10633.539999999999s)]
*  When you watch House of Cards and you go, hmm. [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10634.7s)]
*  Is that about the Clintons? [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10636.539999999999s)]
*  People haven't seen House of Cards just because Kevin Spacey is a dick grabber. [[02:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10640.26s)]
*  I get it. [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10644.02s)]
*  I get it. [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10645.02s)]
*  I get your aversion. [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10646.02s)]
*  But just try to put that aside because it still exists. [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10647.78s)]
*  Can you still watch it? [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10650.42s)]
*  Yeah, I think I never got that. [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10651.42s)]
*  Can you still watch House of Cards on Netflix? [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10652.42s)]
*  I mean, Kevin Spacey did something wrong. [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10654.5s)]
*  The show didn't. [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10657.14s)]
*  You know, it's like I never got that. [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10658.14s)]
*  Yeah, he's an actor. [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10659.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10661.22s)]
*  He would. [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10662.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10663.22s)]
*  Like don't take Woody Allen movies from me. [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10664.22s)]
*  Here it is. [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10665.22s)]
*  House of Cards. [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10666.22s)]
*  You still watch it. [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10667.22s)]
*  It's unavailable on basic with ads planned due to licensing restrictions. [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10669.1s)]
*  Oh, so it's one of the ones you got to pay for now because there's like two different [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10673.78s)]
*  tiers of Netflix now. [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10677.7s)]
*  Like there's Netflix with ads now. [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10679.74s)]
*  Have you watched that? [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10681.26s)]
*  How many ads are there? [[02:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10682.26s)]
*  Is it bad? [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10683.82s)]
*  I think I read it's up to four minutes of ads, but I don't know. [[02:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10684.82s)]
*  I have no idea. [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10686.82s)]
*  If you just play the beginning, I'll go take a leak. [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10687.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10690.54s)]
*  All right. [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10691.54s)]
*  Can I get that later? [[02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10692.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10693.54s)]
*  Let me know when it's when the ads are done. [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10694.54s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10698.060000000001s)]
*  But that show, when you watch that show, House of Cards, you go, Jesus. [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10699.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10703.58s)]
*  Even his accent. [[02:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10704.58s)]
*  How outlandish is this? [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10705.58s)]
*  I mean, how much of you are you making up? [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10706.58s)]
*  How much of this is real? [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10708.460000000001s)]
*  How outlandish is this? [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10711.02s)]
*  I would say probably 90 percent real, 10 percent made up. [[02:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10712.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10715.18s)]
*  There's got to be a percentage of that that's real. [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10716.18s)]
*  When you're dealing with power like that and. [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10720.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10723.26s)]
*  Or at least feasible. [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10724.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10725.66s)]
*  That could be a thing that happens beyond feasible. [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10726.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10729.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10730.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10731.38s)]
*  They're not saints. [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10732.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10733.38s)]
*  And it's not like we know they used to do it like that. [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10734.38s)]
*  Right. [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10735.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10736.38s)]
*  We know that's how they used to do it. [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10737.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10738.38s)]
*  So what point in time do we assume that the government cleaned up all the corruption and [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10739.38s)]
*  became beautiful? [[02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10741.3s)]
*  Would that be true? [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10742.3s)]
*  It was very evident that the shotgun worked because there was not a lot of blood or anything [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10744.3s)]
*  on the scene. [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10749.42s)]
*  You can tell a shotgun blast was on his chest. [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10751.3s)]
*  You can tell that because there was a hole in the chest and pellets come out of his back. [[02:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10754.36s)]
*  It was definitely a self-inflicted in our opinion. [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10759.44s)]
*  How would that make not a lot of blood if there's a hole through his chest? [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10761.84s)]
*  Why is the guy killing himself? [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10767.16s)]
*  He found a tree and pulled a table over there. [[02:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10768.92s)]
*  He got on that table and they took an extension cord and put it around a limb, put it around [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10771.76s)]
*  his neck and shot himself in the chest with a shotgun. [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10776.36s)]
*  The problem is when it says he was definitely self-inflicted in our opinion, how would you [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10780.36s)]
*  know? [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10785.68s)]
*  Why would you think that that is definitely self-inflicted? [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10787.24s)]
*  All you should know is that he was shot with a shotgun while he was hung from a tree. [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10789.94s)]
*  Nobody shoots himself with a shotgun in the chest. [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10794.04s)]
*  Is there a toxicology examination? [[02:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10796.880000000001s)]
*  Was he drugged before that? [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10798.880000000001s)]
*  Was he alive when it happened? [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10800.36s)]
*  Did they force him into that? [[03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10801.68s)]
*  Was there signs of struggle? [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10802.76s)]
*  How do you know that it was self-inflicted? [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10805.48s)]
*  Because there was not a lot of blood. [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10808.12s)]
*  I assume that's because the shotgun wound to the chest cauterized maybe because it was [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10809.12s)]
*  close range. [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10815.72s)]
*  What would cause there to be no blood? [[03:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10817.72s)]
*  But the fact was he was also hanging? [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10819.72s)]
*  One of the other buttons. [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10823.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10824.039999999999s)]
*  If you want to put a shotgun in your face, that's definitely going to kill you. [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10825.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, usually don't people swallow guns? [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10828.32s)]
*  Sometimes people do it wrong and they blow the front of their face off. [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10830.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10833.08s)]
*  That's worse. [[03:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10834.08s)]
*  Tony knows a guy like that. [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10835.08s)]
*  He's probably missing his face because he tried to kill himself and lived. [[03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10836.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah, like those guys who jumped off the bridge and lived. [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10839.08s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10843.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's got to hurt. [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10844.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10846.08s)]
*  A bunch of people have survived that jump too, which is crazy. [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10847.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10850.08s)]
*  Like the Golden Gate one. [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10851.08s)]
*  You see that documentary in the Golden Gate one? [[03:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10852.08s)]
*  A friend of mine did that. [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10854.08s)]
*  Really? [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10856.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10857.08s)]
*  And lived? [[03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10858.08s)]
*  No. [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10859.08s)]
*  Died? [[03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10860.08s)]
*  No, he killed himself on the bridge. [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10861.08s)]
*  Knew him for years. [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10863.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10864.08s)]
*  What's interesting is those guys that did that, they all say once they jumped, they [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10865.08s)]
*  regretted it. [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10868.08s)]
*  Like in the air, the ones who lived, like, oh, fuck, I should have done that. [[03:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10869.08s)]
*  Of course. [[03:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10872.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10873.08s)]
*  Of course. [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10874.08s)]
*  But you want a way out of that fucking horrible feeling. [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10875.08s)]
*  I know. [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10878.08s)]
*  But there always is a way out. [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10879.08s)]
*  Generally, there's a way out. [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10881.08s)]
*  Yeah, you just don't do that. [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10882.08s)]
*  Get help. [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10884.08s)]
*  I think a lot of it is the shame of getting help or something. [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10885.08s)]
*  There's a lot of people too that get older and they just think their life is just fucking [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10888.08s)]
*  disaster. [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10891.08s)]
*  It can't be fixed. [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10892.08s)]
*  It keeps getting worse. [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10893.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10894.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10895.08s)]
*  It's never a good thing. [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10896.08s)]
*  And there's a lot of people that let Jeffrey Epstein in the White House every time. [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10897.08s)]
*  Maybe there's something more to it. [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10904.08s)]
*  But you can't say that. [[03:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10910.08s)]
*  You say that you're a conspiracy theorist. [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10912.08s)]
*  Yeah, well, some conspiracies just seem not like conspiracies. [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10914.08s)]
*  Yeah, they seem kind of real. [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10918.08s)]
*  Yeah, that one, you know. [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10919.08s)]
*  And yeah, you find out a lot. [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10921.08s)]
*  There's a few examples in history that we were talking around the way over here that [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10922.08s)]
*  you're like, oh, that's not a conspiracy. [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10926.08s)]
*  It ended up being true. [[03:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10928.08s)]
*  Well, for sure. [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10929.08s)]
*  Golf a Tonkin. [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10930.08s)]
*  Yeah, and for sure in other parts of the world, if you're involved in some sort of a thing [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10931.08s)]
*  where you have information that can get some sort of a leader in trouble, they're going [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10936.08s)]
*  to whack you. [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10939.08s)]
*  They're going to whack you. [[03:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10940.08s)]
*  I mean, you look at Russia, people just slip out of windows all the time. [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10941.08s)]
*  How about Jamal Khashoggi? [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10944.08s)]
*  How about that story? [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10945.08s)]
*  Oh, the journalists? [[03:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10946.08s)]

*  Yeah. [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10952.08s)]
*  They do that. [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10953.08s)]
*  Yeah, people in power, yeah, will do that. [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10954.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10957.08s)]
*  It's a real thing. [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10958.08s)]
*  House of Cards. [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10959.08s)]
*  Yeah, they do it a lot. [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10960.08s)]
*  I mean, they seem to do it. [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10961.08s)]
*  Yeah, they seem to do it a lot. [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10962.08s)]
*  It seemed like it's happened before. [[03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10963.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10964.08s)]
*  It should be something that people consider. [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10965.08s)]
*  Instead of people like, I mean, probably not. [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10966.08s)]
*  That's not possible. [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10967.08s)]
*  Nah, they wouldn't do that. [[03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10968.08s)]
*  How would they do that again? [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10969.08s)]
*  Yeah, there's a little like American dissonance, like cognitive dissonance, that's what they [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10970.08s)]
*  do. [[03:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10979.08s)]
*  Like dissonance, like cognitive dissonance, where we believe like we're different from [[03:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10980.08s)]
*  other places. [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10983.72s)]
*  Like that could never happen here. [[03:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10984.72s)]
*  Leaders wouldn't do that here. [[03:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10985.72s)]
*  Not here. [[03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10986.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10987.72s)]
*  No. [[03:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10988.72s)]
*  Power's the same everywhere guy. [[03:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10989.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10990.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10991.72s)]
*  Well, you remember when Hillary Clinton was doing an interview and they were talking about [[03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10992.72s)]
*  Libya? [[03:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10996.2s)]
*  After Momad Qaddafi got captured and killed. [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10997.28s)]
*  She was cackling. [[03:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=10999.2s)]
*  She was laughing. [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11000.2s)]
*  She goes, we came, we saw, he died. [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11001.2s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha. [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11003.2s)]
*  That evil laugh, yeah. [[03:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11004.2s)]
*  But that is a crazy thing to laugh about. [[03:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11005.320000000002s)]
*  Not just to do it. [[03:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11009.560000000001s)]
*  Like, look, if an evil dictator gets taken out, that's terrible. [[03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11010.560000000001s)]
*  I mean, there was an evil dictator. [[03:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11013.800000000001s)]
*  It's terrible that this guy was running this country. [[03:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11015.640000000001s)]
*  It's terrible that this guy was, you know, abusing power and killing people and all the [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11017.240000000002s)]
*  things that I'm sure that guy did. [[03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11021.720000000001s)]
*  But then when he dies and you're laughing about it. [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11023.880000000001s)]
*  To emote like that at the news of his death shows that you're kind of like him. [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11026.400000000001s)]
*  You kind of have some, you know, you're not, you know, better. [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11033.52s)]
*  It's sort of an insight, a little glimpse into who you really are. [[03:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11035.84s)]
*  Didn't the United States prop him up at one point in time? [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11040.12s)]
*  I'm sure. [[03:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11042.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11043.2s)]
*  I mean, we propped up a lot of bad guys. [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11044.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11045.2s)]
*  We've made a lot of deals with the devil. [[03:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11046.2s)]
*  You know, we've, we've, we've had to choose a lot of times the lesser of two evils. [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11048.960000000001s)]
*  Sometimes I get that, you know. [[03:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11054.68s)]
*  Do you think that with all this exposure, this stuff, all the open discussions of this [[03:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11056.36s)]
*  stuff in America, like it's less and less prevalent? [[03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11060.2s)]
*  Do you think because more people are aware of all this stuff and more people aware of [[03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11063.0s)]
*  these, like before this would be in a fucking newspaper somewhere and then it'd be gone. [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11067.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11072.6s)]
*  Nobody would hear about it. [[03:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11073.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11074.6s)]
*  That's a good question. [[03:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11075.6s)]
*  But now like people have websites. [[03:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11076.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11077.6s)]
*  You know, like tally up all the people that conveniently disappeared. [[03:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11078.6s)]
*  It's harder to get away with now. [[03:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11082.52s)]
*  It's hard. [[03:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11084.04s)]
*  Definitely. [[03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11085.04s)]
*  And it gets out there. [[03:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11086.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11087.04s)]
*  I think, you know, 9-11 was the beginning of that in a lot of ways. [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11088.04s)]
*  And look, obviously a lot of it's proven wrong, but there are a few things where you go like, [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11090.8s)]
*  that's a little weird. [[03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11096.92s)]
*  That's a little weird. [[03:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11097.92s)]
*  Well, a few, a few of the aspects. [[03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11098.92s)]
*  Here's the weirdest one where the Saudi broils or the Saudi people were allowed to leave [[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11100.64s)]
*  the country when all the airspace was shut. [[03:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11105.96s)]
*  Yeah, a little weird. [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11108.92s)]
*  What happened? [[03:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11109.92s)]
*  What deals did you guys make? [[03:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11110.92s)]
*  It's a little sus. [[03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11111.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11113.92s)]
*  His family members like were, took planes. [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11114.92s)]
*  Weird. [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11117.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11118.72s)]
*  And just a passport survived. [[03:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11120.199999999999s)]
*  I think when anything happens, anytime there's an event, a big event, people take advantage [[03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11122.679999999998s)]
*  of it. [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11128.16s)]
*  Whether they orchestrated it, that's a totally different kind of conspiracy theory, right? [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11129.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11133.64s)]
*  But no one, no one denies that governments capitalize on chaos. [[03:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11134.64s)]
*  They capitalize on crises. [[03:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11140.599999999999s)]
*  They capitalize on problems. [[03:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11142.199999999999s)]
*  Disaster capitalism, yeah. [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11144.32s)]
*  They move in. [[03:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11145.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11146.32s)]
*  Move in. [[03:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11147.32s)]
*  Tighten down the reins. [[03:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11148.32s)]
*  Patriot Act, TSA. [[03:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11149.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11150.92s)]
*  Let me check your shoes. [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11151.92s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11153.92s)]
*  And it's always healthy to question those things. [[03:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11154.92s)]
*  That's the whole point of this country. [[03:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11157.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11158.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11159.36s)]
*  I actually, there was this dude, I won't get that on this big show, but anyway, he, [[03:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11160.36s)]
*  a guy, and I believed him, right? [[03:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11165.119999999999s)]
*  He's a former military guy and he was in Iraq and he said, just talking about the military [[03:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11167.119999999999s)]
*  industrial compass, he was like a lot of what they told us to do was just go into the desert [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11173.88s)]
*  and we would just dump artillery. [[03:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11177.960000000001s)]
*  We would just dump it. [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11178.960000000001s)]
*  Just like it was a way to get rid of old artillery so we could make more, you know, so more can [[03:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11181.64s)]
*  be ordered. [[03:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11186.72s)]
*  Jesus. [[03:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11187.72s)]
*  They just go and they would just level. [[03:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11188.72s)]
*  Just fucking drop it. [[03:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11189.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11191.52s)]
*  And it was off the books, off the, it was hush hush on the QT. [[03:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11192.52s)]
*  Wow, if you want to keep that money coming in. [[03:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11197.24s)]
*  I believed him when he, like he said it and he explained to me and the way he was talking [[03:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11200.12s)]
*  about it and the way he knew it, he would, you know, I was just like, oh, that's something [[03:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11203.6s)]
*  someone who was there knows. [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11207.22s)]
*  Here's a good question. [[03:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11208.22s)]
*  How much accounting is there of how many bullets get shot? [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11209.38s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11211.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11214.5s)]
*  How much accounting? [[03:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11216.34s)]
*  I have no clue. [[03:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11217.34s)]
*  You know, like how many times you pull the trigger? [[03:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11218.34s)]
*  What happened? [[03:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11221.66s)]
*  How many times did you hit people? [[03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11222.66s)]
*  Like, does there accounting? [[03:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11223.66s)]
*  I don't think there's like. [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11224.66s)]
*  Probably not. [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11225.66s)]
*  How could you in the chaos of war? [[03:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11226.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11227.939999999999s)]
*  Who is, there's no like, yeah, there's no justice department for the military in that [[03:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11228.939999999999s)]
*  way. [[03:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11234.179999999998s)]
*  Does it somehow or is there sort of internal affairs for the military that checks that [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11235.26s)]
*  stuff? [[03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11239.98s)]
*  I don't, I don't think there is. [[03:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11240.98s)]
*  So maybe. [[03:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11241.98s)]
*  You know, that's what scares me about riots and protests. [[03:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11242.98s)]
*  I think there's like a thing about human beings who get large groups of people together on [[03:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11248.26s)]
*  the ground, encountering other large groups of people. [[03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11253.220000000001s)]
*  Things get real primal. [[03:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11256.98s)]
*  People go back to like these strange instincts that we had when that was how war was taking [[03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11259.76s)]
*  place. [[03:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11265.92s)]
*  Like if you were alive in the 1200s and war broke out, it broke out on the ground. [[03:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11266.92s)]
*  Like you're running at each other and hacking each other. [[03:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11272.44s)]
*  And it's like a riot, like a crazy elevated super riot, but way worse, right? [[03:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11274.72s)]
*  War killing, death, destruction, people coming out of the people. [[03:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11281.12s)]
*  Like I think people have like this automatic, like there's a weird thing that happens when [[03:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11284.12s)]
*  there's like a group mind, if there's a riot and people are capable of things that would [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11289.2s)]
*  never be capable of any other time. [[03:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11293.08s)]
*  Like it's almost like you go into like war mode, you know, like you go into this primal, [[03:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11295.560000000001s)]
*  like everyone's IQ drops and everyone gets like goes back in evolution. [[03:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11301.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11306.04s)]
*  Like 50,000 years. [[03:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11307.04s)]
*  Everyone gets crazy again. [[03:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11308.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11309.04s)]
*  Because it's almost like you have a programmed reaction to large groups of people involved [[03:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11310.04s)]
*  in like heavy duty, like real conflict. [[03:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11314.84s)]
*  Like windows are getting shattered, bombs are going off, people are screaming, things [[03:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11318.02s)]
*  are getting lit on fire. [[03:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11321.64s)]
*  Like, ah, people get in that mindset. [[03:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11322.859999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11325.58s)]
*  Very like, like during the George Floyd protest, when you saw people lighting buildings on [[03:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11326.58s)]
*  fire and smashing windows and cops were standing by where people are looting stores, like, [[03:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11329.66s)]
*  whoa, this is scary. [[03:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11334.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11337.02s)]
*  There's a, maybe it's that energy, that frenzied energy, that group think that just escalate. [[03:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11338.02s)]
*  You're right. [[03:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11342.539999999999s)]
*  Maybe it triggers something. [[03:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11343.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11344.539999999999s)]
*  I think it triggers like some old timey shit that's in our DNA. [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11345.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11348.62s)]
*  Because I think you had to be ready for when the shit went down if you lived 10,000 years [[03:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11349.62s)]
*  ago. [[03:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11353.78s)]
*  Right. [[03:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11354.78s)]
*  Because the shit would go down like that. [[03:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11355.78s)]
*  Right. [[03:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11356.78s)]
*  Like people just hack each other up. [[03:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11357.78s)]
*  Like people charge at you like, ah, like almost like everybody has to act together in this [[03:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11358.78s)]
*  chaotic group. [[03:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11361.740000000002s)]
*  Right. [[03:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11363.18s)]
*  Right. [[03:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11364.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11365.18s)]
*  There's something that happens to humans when they're in a group where it escalates. [[03:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11366.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11368.62s)]
*  You even feel it when you're a comedian, when you have like a big crowd, there's like, you [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11369.62s)]
*  feel the surge of fucking energy. [[03:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11372.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11374.86s)]
*  From them. [[03:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11375.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11376.86s)]
*  And it's like, and it's real. [[03:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11377.86s)]
*  Like you feel like you could crush a building with your hands. [[03:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11378.86s)]
*  It's like the energy is really like, there's a difference between performing for seven [[03:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11380.5s)]
*  people and performing for the crowds you do. [[03:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11384.02s)]
*  I'm sure you feel like a fucking, you know, it's like, it's kind of like what dictators [[03:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11386.300000000001s)]
*  feel. [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11391.1s)]
*  Well, you feel like an orchestrator, honestly. [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11392.1s)]
*  You feel like you're like a conductor. [[03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11393.980000000001s)]
*  Like you're just kind of like getting out of your own way and trying to like navigate [[03:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11396.02s)]
*  it and bring everybody together with the jokes and put the bits together correctly and have [[03:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11398.820000000002s)]
*  this wave all come together. [[03:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11402.54s)]
*  That's what you do. [[03:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11404.9s)]
*  You're trying to get out of your own way, really. [[03:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11405.9s)]
*  But you feel an energy from them that sort of invigorates you. [[03:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11407.06s)]
*  You get excited for sure, but the goal is always to perform the best you can, which [[03:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11410.82s)]
*  if you're thinking about that energy, you're fucking up. [[03:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11415.74s)]
*  Right. [[03:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11418.5s)]
*  Like you really can't think about that. [[03:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11419.5s)]
*  You really got to think about the bits. [[03:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11420.9s)]
*  You got to be engaged, almost like these are individuals and you're talking to them almost [[03:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11422.14s)]
*  one on one. [[03:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11426.259999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11427.259999999998s)]
*  Because otherwise you get in your own way. [[03:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11428.259999999998s)]
*  You don't want to get in your own way. [[03:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11429.939999999999s)]
*  You're just trying to do the best with the moment and you're almost like a passenger [[03:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11431.1s)]
*  as much as you're the driver. [[03:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11436.300000000001s)]
*  Maybe you've gotten really used to it because whenever I do big crowds, I feel like I feel [[03:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11438.42s)]
*  powerful. [[03:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11443.02s)]
*  Maybe you should never be a dictator. [[03:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11444.02s)]
*  I feel like jacked up. [[03:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11448.02s)]
*  Like I feel like their energy and I feel like just real jacked up, ready for it. [[03:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11449.66s)]
*  Like if I was just like, if I was like, you know, got a standing ovation, I was like, [[03:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11454.58s)]
*  you know what, let's go fucking trash this casino. [[03:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11458.34s)]

*  He's a fudda fudda fudda fudda. [[03:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11464.06s)]

*  Yeah. [[03:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11467.62s)]
*  Well, people that are in control of large groups of people, it's like we were talking [[03:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11468.62s)]
*  about with the sex cults. [[03:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11471.98s)]
*  It's intoxicating. [[03:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11474.02s)]
*  It's an elixir. [[03:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11475.02s)]
*  It's got to be. [[03:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11476.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11477.02s)]
*  It's got to be. [[03:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11478.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11479.02s)]
*  I mean, humans are not supposed to have that kind of control over that many people. [[03:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11480.02s)]
*  And if they did, it was usually like they were the greatest warrior and the chief of [[03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11483.26s)]
*  the tribe and there's only 150 people and you knew that guy. [[03:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11486.34s)]
*  He knows where all the poison plants are. [[03:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11489.54s)]
*  He knows how to get water. [[03:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11491.42s)]
*  He's fucking got the most scars on his face. [[03:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11492.880000000001s)]
*  He survived. [[03:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11494.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11495.66s)]
*  And now it's the guy with the microphone. [[03:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11496.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11497.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11498.66s)]
*  Sometimes they're morons. [[03:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11499.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11500.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11501.66s)]
*  Sometimes they don't know they're morons, which is even scarier. [[03:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11502.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11507.94s)]
*  Like as long as the moron knows they're a moron, I think we're probably better off. [[03:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11508.94s)]
*  You do a good job of that because you've risen to a point where there's a large group, [[03:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11512.7s)]
*  whether you're performing live or whether you're doing this. [[03:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11521.060000000001s)]
*  You temper yourself well. [[03:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11523.980000000001s)]
*  You keep yourself humble and down to earth. [[03:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11526.380000000001s)]
*  That's not easy. [[03:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11528.900000000001s)]
*  You got to stay normal as much as you can. [[03:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11529.900000000001s)]
*  I think one of the ways that I do that, I mean, I always talk about this ad nauseam, [[03:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11532.740000000002s)]
*  but it's working out really hard. [[03:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11535.42s)]
*  I brutalize myself and cold plunges and saunas and shit like that. [[03:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11537.820000000002s)]
*  You pull yourself through difficult shit so that you have a humility because you're constantly [[03:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11542.38s)]
*  feeling your weakness and your breaking point. [[03:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11548.34s)]
*  You're constantly exhausted and pushing through. [[03:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11551.74s)]
*  You're constantly reevaluating your capabilities. [[03:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11554.3s)]
*  If you push yourself to the point of exhaustion, every time you're doing that and you know [[03:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11558.14s)]
*  you have 30 seconds left in the round and you want to quit, but you don't quit, you're [[03:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11561.74s)]
*  pushing yourself past this very difficult moment. [[03:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11565.38s)]
*  In that, you get humbled because you're like, oh my God, I'm such a bitch. [[03:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11569.98s)]
*  Then you sit down and you get exhausted and you wait for that minute to get up and then [[03:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11572.98s)]
*  you do it again. [[03:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11576.5s)]
*  If you could force yourself into doing that, you are very obviously confronted with your [[03:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11577.5s)]
*  limitations, obviously confronted with your weaknesses and where your willpower is and [[03:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11584.539999999999s)]
*  your character. [[03:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11589.9s)]
*  The most willful person, the most disciplined person is still pretty fucking weak. [[03:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11590.98s)]
*  Still pretty weak. [[03:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11595.5s)]
*  You can only sprint for how long? [[03:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11596.5s)]
*  You don't have much in you. [[03:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11597.9s)]
*  You're constantly confronted with human limitations and that sort of informs your humility. [[03:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11600.58s)]
*  I think there's something to that. [[03:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11604.9s)]
*  I really do. [[03:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11606.22s)]
*  I think there's something that people that have experienced too much comfort and no discomfort [[03:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11607.22s)]
*  at all and no testing of their boundaries physically, because people equate testing [[03:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11611.18s)]
*  of your boundaries physically with being like a meathead. [[03:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11616.38s)]
*  But I think it's much more mental than people want to give it credit because I think in [[03:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11620.42s)]
*  overcoming your will to quit, because there's a strong urge to quit when you're working [[03:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11625.18s)]
*  out really hard. [[03:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11630.82s)]
*  A strong urge to quit when you're in the sauna, it's 15 minutes in, you got 10 more minutes, [[03:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11631.82s)]
*  you're like fuck this. [[03:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11635.42s)]
*  There's a strong urge to quit. [[03:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11636.42s)]
*  But in overcoming that strong urge to quit, it builds a mental fortitude and it builds [[03:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11638.78s)]
*  an understanding of your limitations, not of your strengths really. [[03:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11644.14s)]
*  Because you're not really impressed with your strengths if you can only do three minutes [[03:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11648.66s)]
*  in the fucking cold plunge. [[03:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11651.4s)]
*  You're not impressing yourself. [[03:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11652.4s)]
*  At the end of the day, you can't wait to get out of that fucking thing because you're weak. [[03:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11654.68s)]
*  So you know. [[03:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11658.16s)]
*  You can't believe you're something special. [[03:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11659.16s)]
*  You're not something special. [[03:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11661.72s)]
*  You're almost frozen to death. [[03:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11662.72s)]
*  That makes a lot of sense. [[03:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11663.72s)]
*  I get that. [[03:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11664.72s)]
*  That hits all the way home. [[03:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11665.72s)]
*  That makes a lot of sense. [[03:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11666.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think everyone, and it shouldn't just be the kind of workouts I do. [[03:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11667.72s)]
*  Do yoga, go on fucking long hikes, climb hills. [[03:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11671.48s)]
*  Do something physical that humiliates you or humbles you. [[03:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11675.42s)]
*  Something where you know that you have limitations. [[03:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11681.08s)]
*  That's why like martial arts people, jujitsu people, they're some of the nicest, friendliest [[03:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11683.720000000001s)]
*  people ever. [[03:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11687.720000000001s)]
*  They're always exhausted and they're always getting their ass handed to them in the gym. [[03:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11688.720000000001s)]
*  Even the best of the best are humble in many ways. [[03:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11692.4s)]
*  A little bit in comedy too. [[03:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11695.92s)]
*  Joke doesn't work. [[03:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11697.56s)]
*  You get humble. [[03:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11698.56s)]
*  You think you're better than you are, then you have a bad show and you're like, yeah. [[03:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11699.56s)]
*  Sure. [[03:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11702.48s)]
*  And if you really think you're better than the audience or you're better than the material, [[03:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11703.48s)]
*  you're the best. [[03:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11706.32s)]
*  You can be confronted with reality real quick. [[03:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11707.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11711.28s)]
*  I had an interesting thought about you too. [[03:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11712.880000000001s)]
*  Has there ever been anyone in the world, in the history of the world, and this is going [[03:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11717.720000000001s)]
*  to be, I don't know if you ever thought about this, but I don't think there has, who's talked [[03:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11721.92s)]
*  to as many people for as long. [[03:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11726.76s)]
*  Like I don't think, like that's some new shit. [[03:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11731.92s)]
*  Like serious. [[03:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11735.12s)]
*  Like in a way you have to talk- [[03:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11736.12s)]
*  Someone like me for sure that's not even that educated. [[03:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11738.0s)]
*  No, but you just- [[03:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11740.6s)]
*  You get to talk to scientists and- [[03:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11741.6s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just saying like the amount and for as long and as intimately, like what is [[03:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11743.12s)]

*  Nobody's ever talked to the amount of people that you have talked to for as long as you've [[03:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11750.960000000001s)]
*  talked, as intimately as you've talked, like hours a week for so long. [[03:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11755.640000000001s)]
*  You've got so much like of other people's energy and information and like there's, like [[03:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11761.640000000001s)]

*  Nobody's talked to as many people. [[03:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11770.12s)]
*  It's crazy. [[03:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11772.36s)]
*  Like what does that do? [[03:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11773.36s)]
*  Like you got to, I don't know. [[03:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11774.52s)]
*  That's a new thing. [[03:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11776.480000000001s)]
*  Maybe the only dude on the planet who's ever existed who's interacted with so many people's [[03:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11777.560000000001s)]

*  So I just keep doing it. [[03:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11788.320000000002s)]
*  I think if I thought about it like that, I'd probably go crazy. [[03:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11789.720000000001s)]
*  It's wild though, right? [[03:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11792.480000000001s)]
*  What do you think? [[03:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11793.480000000001s)]
*  You could go crazy. [[03:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11794.480000000001s)]

*  Curiosity is fascinating. [[03:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11825.28s)]
*  People's intellectual discipline and their ability to ascertain whether or not they're [[03:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11827.6s)]
*  being accurate or objective and how they're looking at things and whether they've steelmaned [[03:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11834.92s)]
*  an argument against that or whether or not they're ideologically captured by whatever, [[03:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11839.640000000001s)]
*  whether it's a religious thing or a political thing. [[03:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11847.32s)]
*  Like why do they think the way they think? [[03:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11850.0s)]
*  And the really fascinating people are, they've thought of that. [[03:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11852.48s)]
*  They've analyzed their thoughts and their conclusions are more based on an objective [[03:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11856.84s)]
*  assessment of reality and of information than of people that are ideologically based. [[03:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11862.199999999999s)]
*  The ideologically based people often fall apart under questioning. [[03:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11868.039999999999s)]
*  That's fascinating too. [[03:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11871.039999999999s)]
*  It's fascinating when you confront someone with facts that go against their ideology. [[03:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11872.439999999999s)]
*  And you know, and I've experienced it personally. [[03:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11879.24s)]
*  It's just, you know, it's uncomfortable personally when you realize like, oh, I have like a flaw [[03:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11881.199999999999s)]
*  in the way I'm thinking and like I should look at things differently. [[03:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11886.32s)]
*  Like why am I thinking this way? [[03:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11889.8s)]
*  I've always thought of things this way and I just accept that this is the way things [[03:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11891.08s)]
*  should be. [[03:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11894.92s)]
*  But how much have I really looked at it? [[03:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11895.92s)]
*  And then also you, like what I was saying that, you know, some people like my friend [[03:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11897.64s)]
*  Cam has really good eyes, my eyes suck. [[03:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11901.56s)]
*  Some people have better brains. [[03:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11904.0s)]
*  They just do. [[03:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11905.68s)]
*  Their brains work quicker. [[03:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11906.68s)]
*  They're faster. [[03:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11907.68s)]
*  They have more capacity for information. [[03:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11908.68s)]
*  They can disseminate information better. [[03:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11911.779999999999s)]
*  They're better at communicating. [[03:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11914.039999999999s)]
*  They're better at assessing things and analyzing things. [[03:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11915.84s)]
*  And there's a lot of people that are really good at getting out of their own way. [[03:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11921.12s)]
*  And there's a lot of people that aren't. [[03:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11923.52s)]
*  Those people are fascinating too. [[03:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11925.28s)]
*  The people that are constantly tripping over their own dick and fucking up their life. [[03:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11926.36s)]
*  And then some of those people are brilliant. [[03:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11930.12s)]
*  Some of those people are some of the best artists, you know, right? [[03:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11931.48s)]
*  I'd say those are probably your comedy crew. [[03:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11934.04s)]
*  Yeah, these guys like to get their own way. [[03:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11936.960000000001s)]
*  A lot of them, you know, but some of my favorite people step on their own dick. [[03:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11939.48s)]
*  You know, it's part of being a human, man. [[03:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11944.080000000002s)]
*  And we're always pointing fingers and like trying to say, look what you did. [[03:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11946.480000000001s)]
*  Look what she did. [[03:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11951.0s)]
*  Look what you said. [[03:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11952.0s)]
*  Look at those. [[03:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11953.0s)]
*  And those situations are fat like this fucking FTX things. [[03:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11954.0s)]
*  Fascinating. [[03:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11956.52s)]
*  I was reading about Elizabeth Holmes today. [[03:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11957.52s)]
*  The fascination. [[03:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11959.84s)]
*  I was so I'm so obsessed with those kind of people that just make up some fake technology [[03:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11963.160000000002s)]
*  and con super wealthy people into hundreds of millions of dollars investing in their company. [[03:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11969.28s)]
*  Self-made billionaire. [[03:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11974.36s)]
*  And then now facing fucking 20 years in jail. [[03:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11975.88s)]
*  And she owes a hundred million dollars plus. [[03:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11979.48s)]
*  Wild. [[03:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11981.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11982.84s)]
*  Those people exist. [[03:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11983.36s)]
*  I'm fascinated with psychopaths. [[03:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11984.48s)]
*  Maybe she is one, maybe she's not. [[03:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11986.84s)]
*  But yeah, the way they have they're so loose with the truth. [[03:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11988.08s)]
*  They just make up anything. [[03:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11991.88s)]
*  I think they get captured by success, too. [[03:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11993.28s)]
*  They want it to keep rolling. [[03:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11995.08s)]
*  They find ways to fudge the numbers and move this the needle around. [[03:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11996.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=11999.720000000001s)]
*  You know, make it look like everything's better than it is. [[03:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=12000.720000000001s)]
*  Eventually, we'll all work it out and all be fine. [[03:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=12001.720000000001s)]
*  But certain people just don't have that conscious. [[03:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=12004.160000000002s)]
*  They don't have that guilt. [[03:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=12007.12s)]
*  They're conscious like I'm lying. [[03:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=12008.12s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[03:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=12009.12s)]

*  Yeah. [[03:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=12011.12s)]
*  They just go. [[03:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=12012.12s)]
*  And I think there's probably a benefit to that. [[03:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=12013.12s)]
*  Like in some businesses to be associated with. [[03:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=12014.12s)]
*  Oh, without a doubt. [[03:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=12015.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=12017.320000000002s)]
*  They're unencumbered by guilt. [[03:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=12018.320000000002s)]
*  I mean, that's true freedom. [[03:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=12019.720000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[03:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=12027.84s)]
*  You make a phone call and next thing you know, the guy's hanging from a tree. [[03:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzZ2JzQkxs&t=12028.84s)]
