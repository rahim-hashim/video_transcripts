# Joe Rogan Experience #2098 - Matt McCusker & Shane Gillis
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=6.0s)]
*  Boys, salute. Bud Light came all the way back. They came all the way back. Matt, do it responsibly. I can't. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=10.0s)]
*  Are you a non-drinker now? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=24.0s)]
*  No, I drink. I just unfortunately have a bad tummy. Can't have gluten. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=26.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=30.0s)]
*  I've had it since I was like 21. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=31.0s)]
*  Is it a Crohn's thing? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=33.0s)]
*  No, it's like celiac. If I have it, I'll get it. I won't die. I'll just start burping every, you know. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=35.0s)]
*  Celiac's is rough, man. I have a buddy who didn't know he had it until he was like 25 or something like that. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=39.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=46.0s)]
*  It's about when you got it, right? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=47.0s)]
*  21, yeah. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=49.0s)]
*  He probably had it his whole life. Just felt like shit. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=50.0s)]
*  Yeah, maybe I have it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=54.0s)]
*  We might all have it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=56.0s)]
*  You can put down 18 of these. There's no way you have it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=58.0s)]
*  Responsibly. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=61.0s)]
*  There's no way you're not driving. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=62.0s)]
*  True. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=64.0s)]
*  For some reason, you can do it though. I don't understand. I've never seen anybody consume beer the way you can. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=65.0s)]
*  I can drink beer. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=70.0s)]
*  But you just stay at a level, a communication level. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=71.0s)]
*  Well, there's no shots. You know what I mean? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=75.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=78.0s)]
*  Usually the guys, you start drinking like that, you're like, all right, what's the next thing? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=79.0s)]
*  Right. Shots. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=82.0s)]
*  That ends your night. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=83.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a corner I turn where I'm like, oh no. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=85.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=89.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, I get to that corner. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=90.0s)]
*  Really concentrating on my liver. Come on, boys. Pump it out. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=92.0s)]
*  Turn in that corner. Bud Light came all the way back. UFC, Shane Gillis. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=97.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=101.0s)]
*  Let's fucking go. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=102.0s)]
*  For the bros now. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=103.0s)]
*  I mean, that's a good move. Like, that guy that we met, the CEO, he's got it together. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=104.0s)]
*  He gets it. He gets it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=109.0s)]
*  I thought you were the CEO now. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=111.0s)]
*  Just in commercials. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=113.0s)]
*  I knew you guys were going to fucking make fun of me. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=115.0s)]
*  Come on, man. I'm so happy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=118.0s)]
*  It wouldn't have happened without this. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=120.0s)]
*  Listen, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. It just made so much sense. You never let them go. You never bailed on them. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=122.0s)]
*  In the heart of all the craziness, you never bailed. Kid Rock's fucking shooting cases of it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=129.0s)]
*  That turn comes. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=133.0s)]
*  That's your nemesis. That's your nemesis now. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=135.0s)]
*  I have to fight Bobby next time I go to Nashville. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=137.0s)]
*  You have a classic duel. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=139.0s)]
*  I think it was an important moment in culture where people realized there's consequences for certain things. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=141.0s)]
*  Some people, like a guy like Kid Rock, can shoot your brand. You've got real problems with that demographic. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=147.0s)]
*  Who would have guessed? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=154.0s)]
*  Who would have fucking ever thought that was going to happen? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=156.0s)]
*  Just seeing Kid Rock do that, people must be like, oh fuck. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=158.0s)]
*  You think they watched it in a boardroom? Like, guys, we gotta talk about this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=161.0s)]
*  That lady who was in charge, the one lady who made that one video. Let's move on. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=164.0s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=171.0s)]
*  Wow, I didn't see that coming. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=173.0s)]
*  Thanks, fellas. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=175.0s)]
*  I think we've beaten that fucking horse into a pulp. It's a meaty jelly on the ground now. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=177.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's been awesome. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=182.0s)]
*  It's been awesome. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=184.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's awesome. I'm so happy. They're smart, man. They did a smart thing. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=185.0s)]
*  And they did a smart thing with the UFC, too. It's perfect. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=189.0s)]
*  It's perfect. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=192.0s)]
*  They should make the fighters drink a beer before every fight. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=194.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that'd be too much of a deal. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=196.0s)]
*  You know how they have monster cans in their mouth? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=198.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=200.0s)]
*  That probably won't happen though, but why not? Why can't you? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=202.0s)]
*  All you have to do is put Bud Light on the bottle. It's not like they're drinking fucking Monster during the fight. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=207.0s)]
*  That's what I was saying. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=211.0s)]
*  I'm going to say it's bad for you to have Bud Light after a fight. That's crazy. He just got punched in the head 185 times. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=212.0s)]
*  After the fight, yeah. I don't think that's a tough sell. I think those guys are cracking beers after. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=219.0s)]
*  Yeah, like the Shawn Strickland-Drikas-Du Plessis fight. Those guys deserve beer. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=224.0s)]
*  They deserve a lot of beer after that fight. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=229.0s)]
*  Use them as ice packs, too, like a cold one. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=231.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like cold. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=233.0s)]
*  Ah, feels good. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=235.0s)]
*  Done that? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=237.0s)]
*  You know what I've never had used on me is that end swell. They take that piece of hard steel and they push all the swelling away from your eyes so you can see better. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=239.0s)]
*  Oh man, where does it go? They just push off the side of your head just to clear your vision so you can go out there and get punched again. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=249.0s)]
*  Yeah, you ever see that press? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=257.0s)]
*  No, I didn't know what that was. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=259.0s)]
*  That was like Tyson Buster Douglas. They didn't have one. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=260.0s)]
*  They didn't bring it. They thought Tyson was going to fuck up Buster Douglas that bad. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=263.0s)]
*  Well, he had a bad corner. Tyson's downfall is largely related to many things. Everybody falls. They just get too big. It's too unmanageable. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=266.0s)]
*  But also, Costamato died and then he left Kevin Rooney. And so now he's with these guys that were just like around. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=277.0s)]
*  And they're his trainers and it's like he's Tyson so he can beat everybody, anybody anyway. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=285.0s)]
*  But then he gets to this one dude in Buster Douglas who's really prepared. His mom just died. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=290.0s)]
*  And he was always like that super talented guy. Like look how bad I was. Look how bad I was. And they didn't have an end swell. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=296.0s)]
*  They had a glove. They filled a rubber glove with ice. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=303.0s)]
*  Yeah, so stupid. I mean you need to push on that and push it to the side. And Tyson still almost won. He still almost won. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=306.0s)]
*  Yeah, there was a questionable 10 count on that. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=313.0s)]
*  It was a questionable 10 count. It was definitely. But there's a few of those out there in the sport. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=315.0s)]
*  The sport should operate on the time. Like a digital timer should go off the moment someone touches the ground. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=319.0s)]
*  That's how it should go. Because if you're a guy and maybe you like this guy more. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=325.0s)]
*  The fighters and the referees, they know each other. Like I'm around these guys all the time in MMA. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=331.0s)]
*  You get to be friends with them. I'm friends with these guys. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=338.0s)]
*  Damn, so there's no official clock. It's just the referee's in their head. That's crazy. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=341.0s)]
*  Well in MMA, obviously this will count. But in boxing, I'm sure it's kind of a similar situation where they all know each other. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=344.0s)]
*  Like, hey, what's up? What's going on? How you doing? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=351.0s)]
*  Dude, I used to ref kids basketball when I was in high school. And as soon as a kid talked shit to me, in my head I was like, your team's losing. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=353.0s)]
*  I'm going to do everything in my power. As soon as they were like, are you serious? If a parent spoke up, I'm like, you just lost this game for your son. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=359.0s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=367.0s)]
*  Way to go, dickhead. And now just the whole time. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=368.0s)]
*  You're just high as fuck coaching kids basketball. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=370.0s)]
*  You're getting 15 bucks a game. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=373.0s)]
*  Some parents are insufferable. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=374.0s)]
*  Dude, it's insane. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=375.0s)]
*  They're so insufferable. You see it in combat sports too. You see it, like some parents are just so crazy. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=376.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=383.0s)]
*  And they think, they almost want to hit the other kid that fought their kid. Like, hey, this is the deal. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=384.0s)]
*  That makes sense though. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=388.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=389.0s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=390.0s)]
*  No, no, I'm saying like, you see your kid getting hit. It's not like a sport, like a football or something. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=391.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=396.0s)]
*  There's like an instinct to be like, I got to go beat that kid's ass. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=397.0s)]
*  For sure. But you, you know, everybody knows what's going on here. This is like, it's very important you don't violate that. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=399.0s)]
*  Especially with kids and adults. It's like, you're allowing another child to possibly knock your kid unconscious. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=406.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=414.0s)]
*  And then that's the agreement you're making. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=415.0s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=416.0s)]
*  And you're trying to have your kid is trying to knock that kid unconscious. Yeah. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=417.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is what it is. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=421.0s)]
*  It's intense, man. When I used to coach kids, I used to take kids to fights, like young teenagers, take them to fights, you know, and sometimes their parents would just be fucking freaking out. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=423.0s)]
*  You know, it's like, I'm so used to seeing people get kicked in the face. To me, it's like normal. I don't have any kids. I'm 21. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=434.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=440.0s)]
*  And I'm like, okay, how do I talk to these parents and get them to relax and understand like, this is the agreement that's been made here. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=441.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=447.0s)]
*  You can't freak out. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=448.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're going to freak your kid out. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=449.0s)]
*  You're putting too much pressure on your kid. Like, Hylio Gracie used to give his children toys and presents if they lost. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=451.0s)]
*  That's kind of cool. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=460.0s)]
*  Yeah. He wanted them to be, he just wanted them to get better. And he's like, the fear of competition, the fear of losing is so overwhelming. He would do everything he could to mitigate it. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=461.0s)]
*  And so instead of him getting fucking angry and hyped up, he would hug them and give them toys and give them things if they lost. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=472.0s)]
*  That's really nice. That's kind of a good way to go about it. Because even like basketball and football, like I've seen parents like, spaz, dude. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=480.0s)]
*  Yeah, because if you think about it, like the kid's going to try to win anyway. He's not going to try to get his ass kicked for a GI Joe. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=487.0s)]
*  He's going to try to win anyway. So if he wins, he gets the win. And if he loses, he gets a fucking toy. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=493.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=500.0s)]
*  I had a bet once, my dad, if I scored three baskets in a game, I'd be able to rent Mortal Kombat. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=501.0s)]
*  My whole team was trying to get my friends to try to get me the ball. I sucked. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=506.0s)]
*  Six points? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=511.0s)]
*  Yeah, needed six points. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=513.0s)]
*  Jumping six in a summer league game is not easy. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=514.0s)]
*  No, it was young. We were young, dude. It was tough. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=516.0s)]
*  It was so hard. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=518.0s)]
*  There was a wrestling match that was recently, this video went viral because this kid, these two guys are wrestling and it looks like this kid doesn't have an arm in. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=519.0s)]
*  It looks like he's just on the neck, which is illegal in wrestling. You're supposed to have an arm in and the dad jumps in and I think he hits the kid. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=528.0s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=537.0s)]
*  Yeah, the dad, I believe, got banned for life. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=538.0s)]
*  Yeah, that should do it. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=541.0s)]
*  It's pretty crazy. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=543.0s)]
*  Oh, he actually jumped in and beat the dude's ass. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=544.0s)]
*  He thought it was WWE rules. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=546.0s)]
*  He thought it could interfere. He pulled his ankles up. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=547.0s)]
*  I don't know what the rules are to wrestling, so I can't tell you whether or not this, I really know very little about wrestling. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=550.0s)]
*  So I don't know whether or not the kid was doing something that was highly illegal. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=556.0s)]
*  In Jiu-Jitsu, it looks normal. It's like, oh yeah, he got his neck. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=560.0s)]
*  But I guess in wrestling, you can't just grab the neck. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=563.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=566.0s)]
*  You have to have an arm in. I shouldn't even be talking about this. I really should, I honestly should know. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=567.0s)]
*  No, you're right. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=572.0s)]
*  It's the things that I should know. You know, what the limitations of their sport are. But I just, I'm always like, it's so silly. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=573.0s)]
*  I guess we can choke in wrestling. I think you could, maybe like a classic headlock. I don't know. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=579.0s)]
*  Yeah, you could hit him in the fucking. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=583.0s)]
*  Don't you have to have an arm in though? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=584.0s)]
*  I have to have an arm in? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=586.0s)]
*  I don't know any rules about wrestling at all. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=587.0s)]
*  I was also saying it's hard to drop six in a Summer League game. I wasn't, I wasn't a poo in your effort. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=589.0s)]
*  No, Matt, I'm talking about. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=595.0s)]
*  I dropped six in a Summer League game, I was like. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=596.0s)]
*  Yeah, fell down ten times. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=598.0s)]
*  There's a choke where you put someone completely unconscious with one arm, with just the headlock. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=601.0s)]
*  It's called a bulldog choke or a schoolyard choke. They call it a schoolyard choke. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=608.0s)]
*  That's how Carlos Newton beat Pat Miltich for the welterweight title. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=612.0s)]
*  Like way, way back in the day. It's a crazy picture because Carlos Newton is fucking shredded. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=617.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=622.0s)]
*  And he's just got a whole. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=623.0s)]
*  Is that the one you have here? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=624.0s)]
*  No, no, no. That's Alexander Karelin. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=625.0s)]
*  That's a scary one. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=627.0s)]
*  That's the scariest guy that's ever lived. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=628.0s)]
*  The scariest thing I've ever seen. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=629.0s)]
*  He's the scariest guy that ever lived. That guy used to just throw people around. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=630.0s)]
*  But that, that's so, there's no way that's legal because you can put someone unconscious with that. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=633.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think you're allowed. Yeah, probably not. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=638.0s)]
*  Jamie, what are the rules for wrestling? Are you allowed to grab someone by their neck? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=640.0s)]
*  Can you show me the video with the kid where the dad jumps in? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=644.0s)]
*  It's kind of. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=647.0s)]
*  I'm not sure if I found the right one. This one I found. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=648.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's that. But the one you just showed, showed that picture again. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=650.0s)]
*  That's Carlos Newton when he caught Pat Miltich. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=653.0s)]
*  Jeez dude. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=655.0s)]
*  That's the fucking big brother, dude. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=656.0s)]
*  Look at that arm, son. If you had a arm like that, you'd let it sit out the window all day long. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=658.0s)]
*  Hey ladies, look at that arm. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=662.0s)]
*  Good lord. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=664.0s)]
*  Bro, it's so shredded. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=665.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=666.0s)]
*  Carlos Newton was a sensational submission guy too. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=667.0s)]
*  He also fought Matt Hughes and choked Matt Hughes unconscious, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=670.0s)]
*  but Matt Hughes slammed him to the ground and knocked him unconscious, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=673.0s)]
*  and Matt Hughes woke up first. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=676.0s)]
*  And Matt Hughes was like, I won? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=678.0s)]
*  What? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=680.0s)]
*  Like he didn't even know he won. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=681.0s)]
*  What happened was Carlos got him in a standing triangle, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=682.0s)]
*  and Carlos is putting him out while he's standing up. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=685.0s)]
*  And then Matt, in like a last-ditch effort, slams him to the ground as he's going out. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=688.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=693.0s)]
*  Carlos goes out and he goes out, and then Matt wakes up. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=694.0s)]
*  And I remember being there. Matt was like, did I win? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=697.0s)]
*  And he won from waking up first? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=700.0s)]
*  He was the fucking man, dude. Back in the day, he was the man. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=702.0s)]
*  Matt Hughes was like the first truly elite wrestler [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=705.0s)]
*  that learned black belt level submission skills. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=709.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=713.0s)]
*  So they were both out. They were both out. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=714.0s)]
*  And so like Matt's like, he doesn't know what's going on. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=716.0s)]
*  He sat up, so he's good. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=719.0s)]
*  Dude, getting slammed wearing fucking tighty-whities sucks, dude. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=720.0s)]
*  That sucks so bad. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=724.0s)]
*  It was a great fight. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=726.0s)]
*  Matt Hughes was the fucking man. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=728.0s)]
*  Tighty-whities is a wild move, dude. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=729.0s)]
*  Yeah, that is pretty nuts, dude. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=731.0s)]
*  It is a wild move, but everybody wore them back then. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=733.0s)]
*  The Brazilian Vali Tuto guys, they all wore Speedos. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=736.0s)]
*  Because they fought like they fought on the beach. Come on, boy. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=739.0s)]
*  Yeah, pretty boys. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=742.0s)]
*  You got in a fight with some Brazilians on the beach. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=743.0s)]
*  I got robbed in Brazil on the beach. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=745.0s)]
*  They told me they were in their undies. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=747.0s)]
*  No, they were just in some trunks, respectable trunks. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=749.0s)]
*  But yeah, they told me not to walk home on the beach by myself. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=751.0s)]
*  And you just did? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=754.0s)]
*  Late at night or early in the morning. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=755.0s)]
*  I was like, late at night I could see, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=756.0s)]
*  but I was like early in the morning, it's sunrise. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=757.0s)]
*  And I got robbed at Knife Point. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=759.0s)]
*  Damn, that must have been terrifying. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=761.0s)]
*  Getting your ass beat by a guy in a Speedo. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=763.0s)]
*  Yeah, that would suck. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=765.0s)]
*  What did you have to give up? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=766.0s)]
*  It was like seven bucks. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=768.0s)]
*  I had like my wallet or my credit card, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=770.0s)]
*  and then I remembered I had money in my shoe or something. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=774.0s)]
*  They were pissed, and I'm like, oh, here, I have this too. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=776.0s)]
*  They were kind of nice about it. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=778.0s)]
*  They were like, sorry, we're really hungry. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=780.0s)]
*  And I was like, hey, thanks for not stabbing me, guys. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=782.0s)]
*  But I was. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=784.0s)]
*  I was like, you get out of your body. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=785.0s)]
*  When you're getting robbed, you're completely out of your body. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=787.0s)]
*  You're just like, ugh. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=789.0s)]
*  That is kind of a cool way to rob someone. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=790.0s)]
*  Sorry, we're really hungry. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=793.0s)]
*  Yeah, I had a phrase book on me and my credit card. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=794.0s)]
*  They took out my credit card. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=797.0s)]
*  I'm like, you guys can take this to the Mac machine [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=798.0s)]
*  and just get a bunch of money out. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=800.0s)]
*  And they were like, I didn't know what that was. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=801.0s)]
*  And then they took like seven bucks off me. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=803.0s)]
*  And they went through my phrase book, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=805.0s)]
*  and I was laughing at stuff that I had circled. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=806.0s)]
*  It was like, yo, Kerovo say. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=808.0s)]
*  It was like, I want you. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=810.0s)]
*  Oh, they need you. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=811.0s)]
*  They were like, ah. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=813.0s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=814.0s)]
*  And then, yeah. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=815.0s)]
*  It was like the most. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=816.0s)]
*  It was pretty cordial, the whole experience. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=817.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=819.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=820.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=821.0s)]
*  I made fun of it. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=822.0s)]
*  I made fun of my phrase book. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=823.0s)]
*  They were like, bah, they're flipping through it. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=824.0s)]
*  When you land in Rio, you drive through the Vavellos. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=825.0s)]
*  Yeah, so scary. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=828.0s)]

*  He had horses so I was always like we cut through the horse place to get to the woods and like dude [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4248.82s)]

*  But whenever you're riding an animal when you're on an animal like hang on to an animal [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4265.46s)]
*  I got yes necessary. Yeah, it's like this good beside like fuck this guy and this thing could kill me friend of mine was in a [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4270.339999999999s)]
*  Trail of horses where they were going into like this [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4278.139999999999s)]
*  deep [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4282.419999999999s)]
*  Mountain elk hunt and one of the horses fell oh it broke its leg and they had to shoot it right then and there really [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4283.86s)]
*  Yeah, oh cuz they can't get it back. They can't get it back and they don't heal [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4290.46s)]
*  Really? Yeah, they shoot horses damn. I know horses break their leg. They shoot them Jesus [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4294.98s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't know they didn't heal. They don't heal [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4300.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, they never totally heal and I think there's probably you know, this is quite a few years ago [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4303.379999999999s)]
*  It's probably methods that they use now do they can they heal horses? They definitely can't run again [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4309.099999999999s)]
*  Like if it's a race horse, yeah, I just don't like to shoot it. Yeah, they'll never run again, but [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4314.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4319.9s)]
*  They had to shoot this horse my buddy was on this wilderness trail and the horse fell [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4320.66s)]
*  It snapped its leg. He's blasted in the head. I had to shoot it. You see that the racetrack [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4326.46s)]
*  horse breaks his leg they'll bring out like a tarp on the track and just and hide it from the crowd and just [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4332.62s)]
*  Then inject it. Yeah [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4338.58s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't know how you know often they're still doing that but that was that was just what they do [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4341.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah bone suck [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4347.26s)]
*  They break too easy. Yeah, they break so easy [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4349.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's ridiculous. It's a shit design. That's why we have to accept the new when we get AI [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4355.14s)]
*  When you're gonna get a new body gonna get some titanium frame, that'd be sick [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4361.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, when's that stuff coming unlike humans horse has heavy bones and light leg bones [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4366.34s)]
*  This is the way heavy bodies rather in light leg bones [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4371.780000000001s)]
*  This is the way they've developed many breeds, especially the thoroughbreds when bones break they may often shatter [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4375.18s)]
*  It's almost impossible surgically reconstruct the fractured leg [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4380.5s)]
*  Well humans have some large muscles and a bit of tissue below the knee that helps stabilize a broken bone [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4383.780000000001s)]
*  Along with a cast a horse has very little muscle and hardly any other tissue besides tendons ligaments blood vessels and some nerves below the knee [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4389.5s)]
*  Oh, wow [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4397.54s)]
*  The lack of muscle and other tissue means that even in a cast the broken bone has little to support it [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4399.02s)]
*  And it's much harder to prevent a horse from using its broken leg to bear weight [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4405.0s)]
*  Wow [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4409.04s)]
*  Kill it so they have to shoot it. Yeah to kill it [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4410.72s)]
*  Wow, they've figured out some stuff, but that's that's why that that's been the most common way to handle it compound fractions [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4414.36s)]
*  We're broken bone penetrates the skin have a much poorer prognosis and are less likely to heal successfully without complication [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4421.48s)]
*  So its cases are likely to be the euthanized particularly if blood supply to the leg has been compromised [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4427.56s)]
*  So it says repaired the less complicated the flat the fracture the more likely the horse will recover [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4433.28s)]
*  Oh, so there are some that recover green stick and stress fractures are incomplete fractures [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4438.599999999999s)]
*  And these can usually be treated successfully simple fractures where there's one clean break or more likely to heal successfully than shattered bones [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4443.44s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta kill them. Mmm. It stinks. God shoot him. Damn you guys bringing up euthanasia [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4450.96s)]
*  Imagine [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4455.8s)]
*  Tearing a ligament 500 years ago [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4458.04s)]
*  You're dead. Yeah, you mean even during the Bobby or days. Yeah in the [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4461.04s)]
*  Back in those days. Yeah, Bobby or used to work out at this gym that I worked at when I was 19 [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4466.0s)]

*  And he walked in and he can't he couldn't straighten his legs [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4471.360000000001s)]
*  So he had a walk with like legs permanently bent and he would play like racquetball. That's one of his knees [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4474.28s)]
*  What the fuck probably your number four, bro, they they just cut his knees all all over the park man [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4479.62s)]
*  Just covered in scars back then men. The surgeries were terrible and yeah, and you didn't really recover [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4486.6s)]
*  Yeah, you're never really the same again. Yeah, if you have you like [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4493.58s)]
*  Pulled your meniscus and you're like a hunter-gatherer. They're just probably leave you [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4497.3s)]
*  Probably fucked. Yeah, you just walk through it. You just dealt with you guys. I'm fine. Yeah true. Yeah, maybe that too [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4501.9s)]
*  He just dealt with excruciating pain forever [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4508.4s)]
*  Fuck that sucks. Yeah [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4511.2s)]

*  That was the majority of human history was just brutal violent death [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4523.719999999999s)]
*  Well, that's why people all day every day little kids are scared of monsters [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4527.16s)]
*  Yeah, what experience did they have with monsters? No, you know that represents animals that will eat you or wolves [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=4530.259999999999s)]

*  The thing about that they're designed to fight a cat is not necessarily designed to fight the design killed [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=5927.82s)]
*  Grizzlies fight each other all the time and they fight for like 20 minutes and they tear each other apart and they don't get hurt [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-9AfIcyWQ&t=5933.12s)]
