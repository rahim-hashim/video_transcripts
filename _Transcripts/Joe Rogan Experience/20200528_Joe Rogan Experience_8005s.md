# Joe Rogan Experience #1482 - Jordan Jonas
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 28, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrCNpDigVxA)
*  Alright, we're rolling. Hey man, thanks for doing this. Appreciate it.
*  Yeah, it's an honor to be here.
*  Hey, my pleasure. Honor to talk to you.
*  First of all, I really enjoyed you on Kofaro Cast.
*  So, shout out to my friend, Aaron Snyder and Frank Tank.
*  Say hey right back to him.
*  I listened to you on the show and I was like, God damn, what an interesting guy.
*  What a fucking crazy life you've had.
*  So, you were on that show alone, right?
*  Right.
*  And explain that show for people who don't know what the fuck it is.
*  Yeah, so it's a show where they get 10 people.
*  Each of those people get to pick out 10 basic items.
*  You know, like an axe and a bow and a saw and 10 items.
*  Just 10 items. Does that include arrows?
*  Yeah, your bow comes with 9 arrows. So you get a bow and arrows.
*  I guess it's an item. So that's a loosely 10 items.
*  And then you basically take 10 people, fly them out into the middle of nowhere,
*  and you drop them each off by themselves.
*  You got all the video camera equipment and it's just self-filming.
*  And it's basically the last one to give up wins.
*  Wow. And how do you know if anyone's given up before you?
*  You don't. You just are out there.
*  Previously the show's been up. It's up to a year.
*  A year?
*  Yeah, hypothetically it could go a year.
*  Holy shit.
*  So you just go out there and do your best.
*  What if you are still out there but everybody else has quit and you don't know?
*  Then they come and tell you that you've won.
*  So when you won they did that to you. They told you.
*  And how long did it take you? 77 days?
*  77 days. I was completely surprised though. I thought it would go maybe twice that long.
*  You were ready. But let's give people your background.
*  It's kind of unfair in a way, and Aaron brought this up on the podcast,
*  that you were on this show with a bunch of people like me, like regular folks,
*  who have never really lived like that before, but you've done some crazy adventure shit in Siberia.
*  Yeah, so man, I guess how far do we want to go back?
*  Let's go back.
*  We have plenty of time. When did you get started? Have you always been an outdoors guy?
*  Yeah, we grew up on a farm in Idaho and that kind of just puts you in the outdoors.
*  I'd say I kind of had, you know, but then I was doing the normal thing,
*  working concrete job, working at a salad dressing factory, blah, blah.
*  And then my brother took me out riding freight trains and we rode across the country.
*  Like a hobo? Like a hobo, yeah.
*  Did you have a stick with a bundle at the end of it?
*  Oh, we were advanced progressive hobos with backpacks.
*  Progressive hobos. So you just hopped the freight trains.
*  Jumped on a freight train, went across the country, up and back.
*  And then it was also the first time I had been, you know, alone for a while.
*  At one point I split up with them and rode for a week by myself.
*  What year was this?
*  This was when I was 19. I'm 37 now. Something like that.
*  I'm bad at math. So cell phone or no cell phone back then?
*  No cell phone. No cell phone. Oh my God, what a crazy person.
*  It was a real taste of freedom.
*  And I think that was kind of like a coming of age experience for me because I just realized,
*  oh man, I don't really want to, you know, I wasn't going to be in this typical life after having experienced that.
*  Like every night, you know, it's like total freedom. You're up.
*  You never know where you're going to sleep. You never know who you're going to meet.
*  You're always out there in the elements. It's pretty fascinating.
*  Now when you did something like that, did you plan on doing it for a long period of time?
*  I mean, I guess we just planned to go across the country and check it out.
*  Ben, my brother, had been doing it for like seven years.
*  Oh really? Oh my God. So he was like the pro hobo.
*  A pro hobo. So talk me through the process. So he brings it up or you guys discuss it?
*  Yeah, he was just like, you know, he'd been doing it for a while.
*  How old is your brother?
*  Five years older. So he invited me to come with him and I quit my job.
*  And just one day up in Spokane there, you sneak into the train yard and hop on a car and take off.
*  Now did you bring money? Did you bring food?
*  Yeah, you get cans of food in your backpack and usually we would stop and work.
*  You know, a lot of times he had had some connections throughout the country where we could, oh,
*  we could just stop there and work for a guy, make a few bucks and then continue on.
*  But you don't really need much in those situations. You know, you'd do some dumpster diving.
*  Yeah, did you?
*  Well, some of you'd be surprised at how good the food is in some of those places they throw out.
*  But yeah, no, it was, I mean the first night was kind of a christening.
*  I remember it was like April, April still up in Montana Plains.
*  It's a little chilly.
*  Yeah, and it poured out, poured rain and I was in the open car and I don't know how it happened,
*  but I just slept through downpour. My brother came climbing up.
*  I was sitting there probably in three inches of water, almost drowned myself.
*  In the middle of the night he woke me up and I was like, oh man, what happened?
*  I remember that was about the longest morning of my life, just waiting for that sun to go up.
*  It's like going 55 miles an hour in the wind.
*  Oh my God.
*  But you know, every night was some kind of an adventure like that and it was pretty cool.
*  Were all the cars open or did you just sneak into a shitty one?
*  No, there's particular ones that, oh yeah, they're on those like trains that go across the whole, you know,
*  intermodals they're called. They're always open kind of, so you're just exposed to the weather.
*  Did you have rain gear or anything?
*  You know, I had his poncho but I ruined it and it got sucked into the train.
*  Oh no.
*  So anyway.
*  Wow.
*  Anyway, it was, we ended up stopping in Virginia and doing some temporary work down there
*  and that's kind of how I ended up in Virginia and yeah, anyway, go ahead.
*  You just got wanderlust, huh?
*  Yeah, I guess so. I mean, yeah, I guess so. It was just a cool experience.
*  And once you get that taste of kind of freedom, it's like a little bit hard to go back to a nine to five, I guess.
*  I could only imagine that feeling when you're 19 years old and to go back to a cubicle.
*  Right, right. Something like that.
*  No chance. It'd be torture.
*  So we did some construction jobs in Virginia and then I was a young guy trying to figure out how to live a meaningful life or whatever.
*  You know, what am I going to do with my life?
*  Did you have thoughts? Did you have like an aspiration?
*  Yeah, I mean, I guess to provide some context, I'm like follow a Christian path.
*  So I was, that always feels like I got to put some caveats to that.
*  Like it's like I understand for a lot of people that means shame.
*  I know you had like some mean nuns beat you at the job.
*  Yeah, you heard that? Yeah.
*  One mean nun in particular straightened me right out. I was like, all right.
*  No, I know it means a lot of things, a lot of people.
*  But for me, it was always like it was interesting because it was summed up in like in the Bible.
*  Like, you know, love the Lord God with all your heart and love your neighbor as yourself.
*  And God is defined as love.
*  And so that was kind of always the core focus for my, you know, how I tried to decide what I was going to do in life.
*  And at the time, I heard of a guy that was over in Russia building orphanages and needed help.
*  And so felt really strongly that that was the right thing to do.
*  How did you hear of this?
*  So I have a brother that's adopted.
*  And when he grew up, he wanted to find his biological mom and just tell her thanks for the chance at life or whatever.
*  And when he did, turns out she had another son who was going to go over there.
*  And I met him and he told me about this guy.
*  So I basically felt this was the right thing to do and bought a ticket for a year, you know, just a full year.
*  Go over to Russia and I headed over there.
*  And that was kind of how the next chapter, I guess, started in life.
*  And how old were you then?
*  Probably 21 or something. Yeah, 21.
*  So 21, don't know anybody over there, don't know how to speak Russian.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was interesting.
*  Did you try to learn Russian?
*  Oh, absolutely. So this guy that was building the orphanage is an American guy.
*  But I went over there and I didn't want to live with an American because I wanted to learn Russian.
*  So he sent me to a neighboring village with these two families.
*  Both of them were like ex-cons and, you know, had spent a lot of time in Siberian prisons.
*  But they had changed. You know, they were like super cool dudes.
*  One guy was just covered in prison tattoos. One of the funniest guys I know.
*  Did they drink a lot?
*  You know, they did. And those guys didn't because they had changed their ways, you know, and found God in prison.
*  So they took me in like one of their own.
*  And I spent the better part of that year with those guys learning the language.
*  How much did you know before you got there? How much Russian?
*  Nothing, just the alphabet. Yeah.
*  Can you read it? It was brutal. Yeah.
*  I mean, I could make the sounds because I knew the alphabet, but I didn't know what anything meant.
*  So it was, yeah, that was an interesting experience, like just very isolating, to be honest.
*  But also it was, I mean, it was pretty cool, you know, to write it.
*  Yeah. So you could write things to people in that. What is that called?
*  Cyrillic. Is that what it's called? Yeah. Right. Right. Right.
*  So you could write things in Cyrillic. You could read it as well.
*  Yeah. As I learned, of course, I could pronounce out the words because I could read it. I didn't know what anything meant.
*  Over time, I started to learn the, of course, the guy I lived with just taught me all the prison slang and stuff.
*  He's a prison bitch. Yeah. Great Russian.
*  Wow. So that's a crazy thing to do, to just go move there with no Russian at all.
*  Did you buy a book on English to Russian? Yeah.
*  But I found the best way, if you ever go to a different country and don't know anything, just have a notepad with you
*  and throughout you'll start to like get familiar with words as you live in there.
*  And then at the end of the day, you know, I'd write those words down as I recognize them.
*  At the end of the day, I would look up the definition and just five to ten words a day to slowly learn.
*  And by the end of the year, I was pretty, you know, starting to get to where I could be comfortable.
*  So you had a real conversation with people after a year? Yeah. Yeah. It was brutal.
*  It was a long time to wait. But Russian seems like it would be harder than Spanish.
*  Oh, yeah. Because you have to learn those crazy alphabet. It's so different.
*  The alphabet and the grammar so different. I don't know anything about it. How is the grammar?
*  So you don't speak like if you want to say like, I love you.
*  You know, there's no there's no form in the sentence.
*  Like you could say you love I or love you.
*  You know, you could throw the words in any in any order, but the word actually changes based on its role in the sentence.
*  So when you're learning the language, you just get all these words dumped on you and you have to like try to sort through, you know, how it's formed.
*  How would you say I love you in Russian? No, you could say, yeah, to be a blue or blue.
*  Yeah, to be a blue. There's like a is there a reason why you'd say it in different ways?
*  I think you could emphasize and make different. It is a flexible language.
*  You could switch it up to emphasize certain aspects.
*  Is it more ambiguous? Like would people like, are you sure?
*  Say it the different way.
*  No, no, I think it works pretty good.
*  How much do you love?
*  You know, that's not a phrase I got a lot of practice with when I was over there.
*  Should have chose a different one.
*  But it's fascinating that I mean, it's fascinating that people speak in a completely different way.
*  It's just a whole different way.
*  It made me kind of understand.
*  Oh, maybe that's why you get those like Russian authors that were so great because they were supposed to, you know, they were able to form ideas in a slightly more flexible way.
*  Maybe it's interesting. It was interesting.
*  It was interesting to learn a language that I was like, huh, that's actually probably a better language in English in a lot of ways.
*  Yeah, it was like it's a lot of things you can.
*  It's more fun to speak in Russian because you can like switch up words and make weird.
*  But it's always been fascinating to me how people sound so different in different places.
*  Like they have a different way like Brazil.
*  I love Brazil and one of the things I love Brazil, but the way they speak Portuguese, they have a way.
*  It's like a song.
*  They're like, yeah, it's like a rhythmic quality to the way they talk that we don't have.
*  Yeah, no, that's fascinating. Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's it's really interesting that, you know, there's different and then you go to Thailand.
*  They've got their own way. Everything.
*  And all that. Yeah.
*  It's really it's people are so strange in how they I don't you know, I want I always wondered like how does an accent like especially when you think about our country.
*  Right. Like how does a New Jersey accent get formed versus a Virginia like living in Virginia?
*  Sometimes I'm so fascinated by how with all like TV and being surrounded by the standard way English is spoken.
*  I'm just amazed at how some of the people.
*  And you just it's like, what?
*  How do you still have that?
*  But it's awesome.
*  Virginia accent like I like my buddy described it best, you know, like if you replace the Rs with the L's to like put L on these tiles, you know, put an L instead of R at the end of the word.
*  That's air on tires. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Stuff like that.
*  And you got to go, what?
*  You're like, huh? Yeah.
*  But then, no, it's pretty good.
*  I don't know.
*  Oh, and then there's people like Cajun country.
*  Yeah. And Cajun country.
*  Yeah.
*  They got all down there.
*  They got a whole different vibe going on.
*  They got some French shit going on there.
*  Like, whoo.
*  It's crazy.
*  I grew up in Boston.
*  Right.
*  And I did this thing.
*  I was on the news when I was 19.
*  And I heard myself on TV and I heard my fucking terrible Boston accent.
*  And I was like, oh my God, I got to get rid of that accent.
*  And I had only been living in Boston for about six years.
*  But I just we've traveled all over the country.
*  And I just I guess when I was 13, I was very impressionable.
*  I had adopted this.
*  And so I was listening to me and I was talking about working really hard.
*  We've been working really hard at this.
*  I was like, oh my God, I sound like a moron.
*  No offense, Boston.
*  Just some.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's where I grew up.
*  But I abandoned it.
*  And there was a little bit of it still when I lived in California when I first moved here.
*  No, you catch it, man.
*  You catch the accents.
*  I hang out with my wife's Filipino family.
*  All of a sudden, I'll be speaking like, watch out for the radar.
*  Yeah, it's just crazy.
*  I always wondered, like, what started it?
*  Like, what started the New York accent?
*  Why is it so different from an accent from Florida?
*  You know, Florida is all over the fucking place.
*  They don't know where they are.
*  Yeah, I've heard.
*  They're not even sure they're American.
*  They're just like they're floating.
*  So I hear.
*  It's just it's you know, you go to Texas, totally different way of talking than California.
*  It's interesting.
*  It is interesting.
*  A little.
*  That's just I guess how new languages develop over time.
*  Fascinating.
*  That's what's always been weird to me.
*  It's like I don't speak Italian.
*  But my grandparents did and they spoke dialect.
*  So like they spoke like a Sicilian dialect.
*  So they would they would talk like they they would say shit that people who speak proper
*  Italian didn't have no idea what they were talking about.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Oh, my God.
*  So weird.
*  Fascinating.
*  There's so many different ways to communicate.
*  So it's I mean, I know this, but I only know this in a sense that like I know it's a thing.
*  I don't know that like you actually experienced it.
*  Yeah, it was really interesting to learn a very different language.
*  You know, as an adult and kind of like, oh, wow, that's just a whole new way to think.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I'm a little out of practice, but I got pretty fluent.
*  Could explain everything.
*  I still can, you know, say everything I go to Moscow.
*  You can order dinner.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah.
*  You know, and I could definitely have full conversations.
*  I just would screw up the grammar.
*  But could you read a book?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Sometimes I a lot of times I will try to read in Russian just to keep the Gulag archipelago.
*  One of my favorites.
*  Heavy reading, heavy reading, but it's good.
*  So when you were over there and it took you, you said like how long a year before you were really fluent?
*  Yeah, I think a year and the guys I lived with.
*  So they had, you know, both been to prison, but they had also been in prison together with some native nomadic guy that lived up in the north of Siberia.
*  And so my buddy would always tell me, oh, you got to meet my buddy from the north.
*  You know, you got to go live up there.
*  And so so I was like, yeah, that'd be cool.
*  Eventually he connected us.
*  You know, dude was coming through to sell furs in the city.
*  I was there and he introduced me and the event guy, you're invited me up to the far north to kind of check out his way of life.
*  Is that the videos that you show?
*  Yeah.
*  And I'm going to send you these two, Jamie, because it's crazy dudes riding on reindeers like you.
*  You were what?
*  What?
*  What is the name of those people?
*  So those are the event key people.
*  They live in the like, you know, the tiger, the forest up there and they are nomadic men.
*  I didn't even know people like that existed until I met him because they have a video.
*  You already have it.
*  You wizard.
*  They are cutting the antler off the one.
*  So why do they cut the antlers off?
*  They do it for a number of reasons.
*  One is because they that antler skin.
*  Well, this one particularly was growing into the reindeer's eye.
*  So they were going to cut it off to help the reindeer.
*  And then you can also eat the skin off the velvet.
*  And it's, you know, Chinese medicine for men's health and stuff.
*  Well, it actually was a thing that they were selling as a supplement.
*  Yeah.
*  And they were they were selling.
*  Oh, man, they're digging in there.
*  It's all bloody and shit.
*  Isn't it crazy?
*  Like animals with antlers.
*  It's such a bizarre thing because they regrow every year.
*  So much energy fall off.
*  Yeah. So much energy into that.
*  And caribou, which is what a reindeer is.
*  I believe they have the largest antlers to body size of any.
*  All right. Yeah, there's a massive.
*  Oh, hey, you're getting serious.
*  So how often do they do that?
*  I'll show that.
*  That was a assassination.
*  So they would ride them and take care of them.
*  But occasionally they would eat them.
*  Yeah, exactly. They provide everything for them.
*  So they have this they have a big herd, you know, a couple few hundred reindeer.
*  And they basically live off of them.
*  So they're their transportation, their clothing, their food, their food, their economic, you know, economy.
*  My friends, John and Jen, they live in Alberta.
*  There's a place near them that had an elk farm and they farmed elk for the velvet.
*  Oh, yeah. That's what they farmed them for.
*  They would velvet.
*  I believe they would sell to like a bodybuilding company.
*  I think there was a vitality.
*  You know, I think it's got growth hormone in it.
*  I think that's what it is, because there was a time where it was a thing that you would buy in like,
*  I don't know if they do it anymore, but in health food stores, you buy like antler spray.
*  Yeah. And it was somehow they broke it down to a spray.
*  I mean, I don't even know if it worked.
*  No, yeah, I don't either. But I mean, I'm pretty sure rhinoceros horn doesn't.
*  But I'm an rhinoceros horn.
*  Did you see what happened where there was fucking tons of beaver penis?
*  They found they they caught a cargo going to China because there was tons here.
*  I'll send you the fucking tons of beaver penis.
*  Here it is. And you're fast.
*  He's the he's the wizard.
*  Chinese authorities sees 12 tons of beaver penis smuggled from Canada.
*  Wow. Yeah.
*  And it's again, it's a vitality thing.
*  It's about the erections.
*  The cool thing about the Havinki up there is it's a sustainable what they're doing because they got their own their own reindeer and they manage them and all that.
*  So they don't have to import beaver penis.
*  Right. They got reindeer, plenty of reindeer.
*  Oh, God, there's the beaver.
*  Oh, boy.
*  Poor beavers.
*  There's so I mean, to kill that many beavers, what is the number of beavers?
*  It says 40 to 50 billion US dollars.
*  What?
*  The market value of animal parts illegally imported on the Chinese market.
*  I mean, that's still a huge number.
*  But yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, a little steep for that.
*  Yeah, it's so crazy.
*  Like they have these according to my friend who's been to China many times.
*  He said it's not even that they really believe that like rhino horn is good for your dick.
*  But what it is, it's like it's so hard to get and it's so exotic and they like having it.
*  So they like like if a businessman comes over, yes, would you like some rhino?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah. Come into the secret room.
*  Push on the fucking wall of the library and slides.
*  You know, like spy movies.
*  You go back to a tea room with rhino dick.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. Dear antler, IGF one spray supplement.
*  50 bucks.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it's really mean it could be.
*  It could be the fact that they do grow so fast every year.
*  You know, there might be something in there.
*  I don't know.
*  Well, with that, they taste good.
*  Just like off the velvet and we'd roast it over the fire real quick.
*  What does it taste like?
*  It's kind of got the bamboo shoot texture, like kind of that firm texture, but it's real smoky.
*  Anything smoky is good.
*  What does it say?
*  Ban substances.
*  Although previously found on the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of banned substances,
*  Dear Antler spray was removed in 2013 when it was deemed completely safe and legal to consume prior to athletic activity.
*  OK, you know what that means?
*  That means it doesn't work.
*  Yeah, they took it off the thing.
*  They take it off, it means it doesn't work.
*  Safe to eat.
*  Good to know.
*  That doesn't mean, that means there's no fucking performance.
*  Oh, that's it.
*  Ray Lewis, who was rumored to have used it following an injury to his tricep in 2013.
*  You know what?
*  I bet they've just realized like, hey, you know what's better than this?
*  Real growth hormone.
*  Right, right.
*  This is fucking stupid.
*  Concentrate it.
*  Run around sucking on Dear Antlers.
*  But this farm near my friend John and Jen's place, they bought this farm specifically, these people did, not John and Jen.
*  Right.
*  These people specifically started farming elk just for their velvet.
*  Yeah.
*  And then the market crashed.
*  Like it wasn't valuable anymore.
*  I guess this was prior to 2013 when it was illegal.
*  And so this poor guy had all this fucking elk.
*  Yeah, there's an elk farm up by my house in Idaho that has recently closed down.
*  I wonder if similar circumstances.
*  Yeah, I wonder.
*  I mean, how crazy is it that the most delicious meat on earth is not.
*  Yeah, you think that'd have a market, right?
*  Yeah, that's not what you want.
*  You want the fucking antlers.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh man, that's.
*  Yeah.
*  Such a crazy animal that they grow that stuff in like three months.
*  Yeah.
*  Look at the size of that rack.
*  Just that rack on the wall back there is.
*  It's got to be some growth hormone in there.
*  Something crazy.
*  That's pretty wild.
*  But and also with elk, they keep them a lot longer than a lot of deer species because they use them to fight off wolves.
*  So apparently they keep them like deep into the winter.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I know the female reindeer keep them a long time too.
*  Isn't that interesting?
*  The female reindeer are the only deer that actually have antlers.
*  Antlers, right.
*  Probably also for protection.
*  Yeah, I think it is.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I think it is.
*  So when you're up there and these folks have these caribou and they're riding them and they're taking care of them, do they shield the other caribou from seeing one of them get slaughtered?
*  No, they don't seem to be too worried about it.
*  It's a very mutually symbiotic relationship between the reindeer and the reindeer.
*  They're always getting attacked by wolves and tore up and stuff and they always are coming to the people for protection in those times.
*  Not only from wolves but even from mosquitoes and gnats.
*  They'll build big smoky fires.
*  So the reindeer know people are their friends and I guess are okay with an occasional...
*  Occasional eating?
*  An occasional sacrifice.
*  So if they have 200 of them, how often do they kill one?
*  They try not to kill them.
*  They actually really avoid trying to kill their own reindeer.
*  You're mostly living off of moose and wild reindeer and game birds and stuff.
*  Oh, like reindeer that aren't theirs.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Interesting.
*  So because these are domesticated, they just behave differently.
*  It's so weird to see them with saddles on and shit and people riding them.
*  They're one of the first animals to be domesticated actually.
*  By humans?
*  Yeah, it's interesting.
*  Really?
*  Before dogs?
*  Not before but one of the first I guess.
*  And then they've been domesticated so long that they don't even know how to domesticate wild ones anymore.
*  This is crazy.
*  Jamie, go back to that.
*  Let me see how they put up these teepees.
*  So they have this setup ready to go.
*  And then when they get to a place and they decide to, then they pull out the sticks.
*  Yeah, in the summer you're moving every three days or so just following the reindeer herd through the forest.
*  In the winter everything's a little slower.
*  You'll be in a place for a month or so.
*  But just, yeah, nomads.
*  What do they do when the weather sucks?
*  They have this teepee setup.
*  You're just out in the weather also basically.
*  When it's really cold, negative 50, they have a little wood stove in the teepee and it keeps the thing pretty warm.
*  What I was asking about actually is the wind.
*  Because the way they have these sticks set up, it's like they have these animal skins that go over.
*  Is that animal skin?
*  That's canvas.
*  That is?
*  Yeah.
*  So it just looks like it's a buff skin.
*  So they have these canvases.
*  Do they have loops where they tie it down?
*  Yeah, they do.
*  And then they put, they lean sticks on the outside also to kind of hold the canvas in place.
*  So these people live so nomadic.
*  Yeah, it is very nomadic.
*  Man, it's awesome though.
*  It's so fascinating to live like that and compare it to the modern world.
*  Because not too many people get the opportunity anymore.
*  And you're so wired for it.
*  It's weird.
*  So your body just immediately falls into place for it?
*  Yeah, all your dopamine reset.
*  You'll be out there fishing and every day you'll just be like, yeah, I got a fish.
*  Because you're relying on it so much.
*  Whereas in normal everyday life here in town and stuff, when do you get that excited?
*  You don't have any schedule.
*  So every day you wake up, it's like, well, what do I need to do today?
*  And you're just free to choose.
*  You can go try hunting.
*  You can go collect berries.
*  You can go find your reindeer.
*  There's just a number of options all available to you.
*  And they're all directly related to your life.
*  So you don't have any, there's no money being thrown around out there.
*  It's just kind of, I'm hungry.
*  Let's go fishing.
*  Let's go to that spot because it's cool.
*  What do they do if they get injured?
*  That's the problem.
*  They actually have...
*  There's good and bad out there.
*  They can call in a helicopter, but it's so far out, it's going to be a problem.
*  I've broken some ribs out there and had some, myself had some serious injuries that just wasn't an option.
*  You just got to tough it out because there's...
*  Like what kind of injuries other than ribs?
*  Oh, man.
*  I chopped my knee with an axe one time with cut a tendon, that tendon on the inside of your knee, right in half.
*  And my other knee had recently had a knee surgery, so I was just laid up.
*  Literally like three days I was just laying in a teepee.
*  Couldn't move.
*  I had to roll over, poop in a bag.
*  It was brutal.
*  But then they rubbed like pine sap on it and it actually healed.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  I could have swore it would get infected, but they just packed it with pine sap.
*  Pine sap?
*  Yeah.
*  Healed right up pretty fast.
*  What happened to the ligament or the tendon that got cut?
*  I don't know.
*  It doesn't really feel as bothering me, but I didn't know it was cut at the time.
*  It was only later when I did a...
*  An MRI?
*  Yeah, they told me it was.
*  So it never healed?
*  Well, I don't know what it did.
*  They said it was hanging on by a thread.
*  I don't know if it ever healed back or what.
*  Wow.
*  You don't even care?
*  You know, I don't notice it as being weak, so I haven't bothered.
*  My surgery knee hurts more than that knee.
*  What kind of surgery?
*  I see a couple ACLC's.
*  Yeah.
*  You know how it is.
*  Yeah, I do.
*  So one of those videos that was showing a net, is that the way they would fish?
*  Both.
*  You know, a lot of times you'd put nets out and a lot of times you'd just go cast your
*  birch homemade rod and just see what you can catch.
*  So this is a net, they would just move it across the middle of the river?
*  You'd set it and leave it and they're just setting it right now.
*  How do they do that thing that they do on the ice when they do that, when it's frozen?
*  When it's frozen?
*  When they cut a hole and then they somehow or another get that net to go through to the
*  other side.
*  You cut two holes and then you get a long stick and you shove it in the hole and slide
*  it, then like push the stick under the ice and on one end you have a string tied to it.
*  So you push it and keep trying that until you get it to slide under the ice to the other
*  hole.
*  And when you do, you pull the stick out of that hole and tie your net on the end of the
*  other one and you can pull the string through.
*  So the string on the end of the stick, do you catch it with a hook or something and
*  try to pull it up?
*  Let me see if I can, yeah, no, you just pull the actual stick up through with the string
*  tied on the back side of it.
*  So you just have to find the stick.
*  Yeah, you just got to get the stick to, you might have to three or four times slide it
*  under the ice until it ends up where the other hole is.
*  Whoa.
*  That works good.
*  I did it on that alone show.
*  It was fun.
*  Yeah, that's what I'm asking.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  And so that must be really hard to do by yourself because I've seen people do it on television
*  on those Survival Alaska shows.
*  Oh, right.
*  It wasn't too bad.
*  No, it was, that part wasn't too hard.
*  But no, yeah, I don't know.
*  It was all good stuff to learn out there with the natives and then came in handy for sure.
*  Have you ever seen the Werner Herzog documentary?
*  Yeah.
*  Happy people.
*  I forgot the native that I actually first met that I was telling you about, that Uri guy.
*  He isn't a nomad himself.
*  He's a fur trapper.
*  So he does all that real similar to that Werner Herzog documentary.
*  And actually where they filmed that isn't that far from where I was in Siberia.
*  So he won.
*  Yeah, I went fur trapping with him one year.
*  And it was kind of showed me the rough ropes on it.
*  You know, he told showed me a topographical map.
*  He's like, there's a cabin, there's a cabin, there's a cabin through some noodles in each of my cabins.
*  You know, we stocked them with noodles.
*  And then he just dropped me off and said, see you in a month and a half or whatever.
*  And so just was out there.
*  I had a stupid little.
*  Oh, they're wrestling.
*  Yeah, good times.
*  These kids wrestle a lot.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a good way to grow up, man.
*  Always just outside having a good time.
*  Yeah, I guess so.
*  The Werner Herzog documentary was really fascinating because as you watch those people and when they talk about like no depression, they're all happy.
*  They're always laughing.
*  They love what they do.
*  They enjoy what they do.
*  But even though that's like everybody's goal, right, everybody's goals, right.
*  Right.
*  Everybody's like, fuck that.
*  I'm not doing that.
*  Yeah, that's a fascinating conversation in and of itself because, you know, having been up there and stuff, I'm just like, man, this is an awesome.
*  Way to live.
*  If it was like my friends, my family in that context, it's like I would probably choose that way of life.
*  But, you know, then you find yourself here in America and you're stuck on your phone and it's just so unsatisfying that it's interesting to experience both.
*  But it's kind of hard to.
*  I mean, I mean, because you're in where you are.
*  So my family's all here.
*  Everybody's all here.
*  We're not nomads.
*  Right.
*  But it's funny to have experienced that way of life and almost think, man, that's kind of what we're made for.
*  It's almost better.
*  I wish I wish I could implement that in some way, you know, here.
*  I'm aware of that because people say it, but I'm not aware of it in the sense that I've experienced it before.
*  I've never experienced like just completely live.
*  I've hunted, right, camped out for a week at a time.
*  Yeah, you start to get a feel for it.
*  Yeah, you sort of.
*  Maybe not.
*  It seems like when there's no other option like that's how you're eating.
*  Yeah, we were eating mountain house and yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  When we shot a deer, then we'd eat the deer.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, no, you were speaking of which you've read those like Quanah Parker and books and stuff.
*  Me too.
*  And having lived with those natives, it's like there's so much good there.
*  You see like they really are happy people.
*  So there's a giant difference between the people who live in the village and the people who live in the forest.
*  And the people who live in the forest, you would genuinely call like happy people.
*  Like this is they're knowledgeable.
*  They're being productive.
*  They're doing all this stuff.
*  Whereas when you go to the village, it's just like everybody's drunk.
*  Nobody's doing anything.
*  It's like just a total wreck, especially villages that don't have any reindeer herding connected to them because they kind of don't have their cultural context to
*  remain connected to.
*  So the so at least in the villages that have reindeer herding, the kids can go out in the summer and live with the reindeer herders and kind of experience that.
*  And it gives them a source of pride.
*  It gives them like the experience of living in the forest, becoming like kind of really in touch with nature and all that.
*  And whereas in the village, it's just kind of a dark hole.
*  Everybody drinks in those native villages.
*  It's like the statistic is that one out of three people die of suicide, homicide or accident.
*  So it's just and you feel it like I've got some stories of that.
*  That's just brutal, too.
*  But the the I when I read those like, you know, Empire of the Summer Moon, those types of books.
*  And I grew up with a couple of good friends that were Native American.
*  And it really made me think like, I wonder if you could seeing how how well how much of a difference it makes having that culture intact to some degree.
*  Like, I wonder if, say, on Pine Ridge, you know, on some one of these one of these reservations, if you could almost replicate something like that, like if you could maybe take the initiative to like restore some buffalo herd,
*  use a bunch of unused land, maybe the government land or or tribal land that's kind of unused, restore herd and then kind of bring back those nomadic ways.
*  It's not like everybody would have to live that way.
*  But from my own experience, watching places that have that option, you know, that kind of that are connected to that culture flourish a lot more than the ones that didn't.
*  There were Venki villages with no reindeer herding and ones with and it was like night and day as far as and so it's like, I wonder if that would be anyway, it's something I've thought about.
*  It's an interesting thing to think of.
*  But one of the things that happened to the Native Americans in this country, all the pieces of land that they got for reservations sucked.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  The dirty trick that the white man pulled.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  I wonder.
*  Right.
*  I mean, is any of that land suitable for raising like?
*  Well, I'm sure some of the land is good.
*  I wonder or?
*  I'm saying every piece of land, but yeah, yeah, yeah, it's not really true.
*  But a lot of it.
*  No, for sure.
*  Oklahoma and the Dakotas.
*  They sent them to some barren land.
*  But that was where the Comanche's were anyway, right?
*  Right.
*  Oklahoma.
*  You know, before the white settlers got here and fucked everything up.
*  Yeah.
*  Oklahoma is probably pretty dope.
*  Right.
*  A lot of animals.
*  No, yeah, yeah.
*  A lot of things happened.
*  Imagine seeing 13 million buffalo roam in the plains.
*  Well, there's an interesting story to that too.
*  Like that seems a little bit imbalanced as well.
*  And there is Dan Flores, who's a wildlife historian, right?
*  And he wrote an amazing book called Coyote America.
*  It just really gives you a really interesting understanding of how weird the animal coyotes are.
*  Now they've spread out across the entire country.
*  It's a beautiful book.
*  But he also wrote a book called, I think it's called Bison Ecology and Bison Diplomacy.
*  And maybe this was a paper.
*  It might not have been a book.
*  But essentially the thought behind this was these millions of buffalo that you see when that did happen,
*  that only happened because the Europeans had come and given the plague, given the smallpox
*  and all this to Native Americans and wiped out massive numbers of the hunters.
*  So there was like at one point in time, there was as many as 90% of all the Native Americans died from disease,
*  which is insane.
*  There could have been literally millions of people dead from disease that would have been nomadic buffalo hunters.
*  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
*  So what his theory is is that they were in these incredibly large numbers because of that.
*  Because he points to, there's a time where the earliest settlers were making their way across the country
*  in like the 1500s and somewhere around that.
*  And they didn't talk about buffalo.
*  They didn't.
*  They talked about deer.
*  They talked about bear.
*  They talked about all the animals that we know existed.
*  But there was no talking about massive herds of buffalo.
*  That all this seemed to have come after the Native Americans were wiped out.
*  And it kind of makes sense.
*  Not wiped out totally, of course, but a large number of them wiped out.
*  Whereas these animals just, where they're used to being preyed upon, just bred like fucking crazy
*  and developed these huge herds.
*  You're talking about obviously over a period of hundreds of years, right?
*  Right, right, right.
*  Yeah, I know that makes sense.
*  It'd be interesting to, or maybe those travelers didn't run into the herds if they were bunched up in groups.
*  Yeah, that's possible too.
*  But who knows?
*  I mean, it makes a lot of sense.
*  90% of the population, you know?
*  Yeah, it's a really interesting story.
*  Like when he breaks it down, it really isn't in balance.
*  If you think about it, why would there be a million buffalo?
*  Or many millions?
*  Where's the predators?
*  Yeah, it's crazy.
*  Well, buffaloes are so interesting too because they don't really, predators don't fuck with them.
*  This giant furry thing, you can't even kill it.
*  They're so big.
*  There's so many of them, they're just going to stomp you.
*  My friend Remy Warren, he's very famous in the hunting world.
*  And he had a show called Apex Predator.
*  And he replicated a famous Native American painting.
*  And this famous Native American painting, what they would do is they'd kill a coyote.
*  And they would skin the coyote and then put the coyote skins on and walk on all fours up to the buffalo and then shoot it with a bow and arrow.
*  Because the coyotes were no threat to the buffalo at all.
*  So the buffalo would look at a coyote like, what, you want some of this bitch?
*  Like a baby coming up to a grown man trying to pick a fight.
*  They weren't worried about the coyotes.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I believe it.
*  Yeah, it's a famous painting.
*  I've seen those two guys sneaking up on the herd.
*  Apparently that's literally what they used to do sometimes.
*  They had a bunch of different strategies for how to get close enough to the buffalo.
*  Because if they're using a traditional bow like they had, if you're shooting 40 yards, if you're Aaron Snyder maybe.
*  Totally.
*  But when you get into that range, like 50, 60 yards, good fucking luck.
*  Oh man, you're lobbing them.
*  Yeah, and it's probably going pretty slow anyway by the time it gets there.
*  So you don't get much penetration on an enormous animal with two by fours for ribs.
*  Yeah, yeah, man.
*  Yeah, you can imagine hunting through those herds.
*  You know, they say they're like sending arrows into this massive running herd of buffalo while you're on your horse next to it.
*  Fascinating stuff.
*  Well, that book by Sam Gwynn, what does he call himself?
*  S.E. Gwynn?
*  Yeah, his name's Sam.
*  Sam Gwynn, who I had on the podcast.
*  When you read that book, the life that they had was so intense, the Comanche.
*  And it was so fascinating.
*  It kind of makes you want to live like that.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  Right, man. That's what I was talking about earlier.
*  Like even living with the nomads in Siberia, it's like after having done that, it's a harsh climate.
*  Brutal place. The alcoholism is rough.
*  But all that into account, it's like, man, you would almost choose this.
*  Especially now we have the advantage of having modern medicine and stuff also.
*  And supplies that you can get so you're not going to starve if your hunt's bad and a broken leg won't end you.
*  It's fascinating.
*  That's fascinating. That's part of the reason why it's like, I wonder if now you could kind of help revitalize some of that culture in a way.
*  You'd have to have an enormous piece of land.
*  See, the beautiful thing about the way the Native Americans lived before the white settlers came along was that there's no boundaries.
*  The worst they had to worry about was their tribes.
*  And what they did to each other was fucking horrific.
*  That's the other thing that gets documented in S.E. Gwynn's book, in Empire of the Summer Moon.
*  Because we have this narrative that the white man came along and did terrible things to the Native Americans, and the Native Americans did terrible things to the white man.
*  But no, they were doing terrible things to each other. They're humans.
*  Humans do terrible things to each other. Especially fighting over resources, fighting over land and women and buffalo and all the other stuff they fought over.
*  Yeah, yeah. No, it's true. Yeah, you would need a huge piece of land.
*  Huge.
*  There's a...but it's like also how many buffalo would you need to have a sustainable thing going?
*  I don't think it would be that many. You know, if you can do it with 200 reindeer, buffalo are a lot bigger.
*  You know, it's like, I don't know.
*  But they're herding these. You can't really...
*  Yeah, but they're like...yeah, I mean, I guess it would be something to figure out.
*  There's an interesting project. Have you ever heard of that Pleistocene Park?
*  Yes.
*  If people told you about that?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, it kind of reminds me of maybe something like that where you would have to have a big area that you kind of...
*  That's the American Serengeti project. Is that what you're talking about?
*  It's similar. It's in Russia, though. It's where they kind of had the hypothesis that if, you know, back in the day the climate wasn't that much warmer up north, it was just there was so much density of animals that they, you know, pooped, built better soil and grass grew, and it made for a more lush ecosystem than the tundra now.
*  And so they've basically fenced in an area, packed it full of muskox and moose and all that. And sure enough, you can see pictures in the grass is growing taller, you know, like, it's much more life-giving ecosystem than the surrounding just tundra. It's interesting.
*  Yeah, I mean, it makes sense. There was talk about they were going to do something to try to revive the mammoth.
*  What is this? This is Pleistocene Park? Oh, so this is the place. Those are fucking freaky animals, man.
*  Yeah, anyway, those are cool projects, any of those ones where they're restoring land and animals.
*  It's always interesting to see, you know, like when they have these theories about, you know, I had a guy on last week, his name is Joel Salatin.
*  Right, right. He runs Polyphase Farms. And he was explaining how when you farm and let the animals just live like animals live, you use their manure, they shit on the ground, they eat the grass, and it's actually, not only does it not add carbon to the atmosphere, it actually takes it out.
*  Right, it builds a... Yeah, it actually builds healthy soil. You don't need fertilizer. It's natural. There's a whole system that nature's put in place.
*  But when we have these mono-crop agricultural setups and these weird factory farm setups, we're just hijacking nature and forcing it to do slave labor.
*  Yeah, it's a shame, man. It'd be cool to tap into what, you know, like permaculture, I guess they call it, just tap into some of that on a larger scale because it doesn't seem very sustainable with those.
*  No, it doesn't. And the large scale stuff, he was kind of saying that it was possible to feed like all of Los Angeles that way, but I'm like, oh, I'm not going to do that.
*  It's like, this is a lot of people, man. I'm not sure. It's never been done. When something's never been done, you got to go, huh, I don't know if you can do it.
*  Right, I guess you just start small and see where it goes.
*  We might have already fucked this up by just having too many people. This has never been a thing before. For the last few hundred years, it's never been a thing where you pack 20 million people into one spot.
*  Yeah, yeah. What? Yeah, it's crazy flying into LA. You know, it was my first time here, but it's like, oh, is your first time here? Oh, wow. Packed and from good amount of smog.
*  Idaho to this. Yeah, I've been to New York and stuff, but good amount of smog. That's funny because it's the clearest it's ever been in the history of Los Angeles because of the pandemic.
*  Have you ever been to Beijing? No. Oh, man. Talk about brutal as far as the air goes. You step off the airplane into the airport and it's probably ventilated and you step off and you're just like, oh, it smells like aluminum and just nasty.
*  You can't even see the city. It's so dense. The smoke. And then you kind of get used to it as you're walking around the airport and then you step out of the ventilated airport and it hits you all over again.
*  That place is rough, but they're doing better now too with the. It's hard. I mean, as far as the smog and pollution and all that, but who knows? I've been to Mexico City, though.
*  Mexico City is rough. It's rough. I don't think it's as bad as Beijing, but I got a headache the moment I got out of the plane. I was like, whoa, this is.
*  You can't see shit when you're flying in. You would swear there's a fire. Yeah, there's no fire. It's just how it is there. Yeah, that's rough.
*  Now you were saying that these people that live in the villages outside of the people that are nomadic, those people live in a real shitty way.
*  Yeah, it's rough. It's like there's a it's like unconnected to any other villages. You have to only get there by helicopter. You fly in and it's what are they? What is their job?
*  What do they do? Some of them work like in relation to the reindeer herds. And I don't know. I think a lot of people live off of like grandma's pension, which you know in Russia is probably like 100 bucks or something, you know, and
*  you know, some people work at the school and the administration is just not a lot going on. But a lot of people are sustenance like hunters, fishers and trappers that live in the village.
*  But yeah, it's it's it's so weird because the first time I went there, it was just like, man, this place is crazy. Everybody's drunk. It's like being in like a zombie land. Like even when the reindeer herds will come from the woods, they'll like run into their house, lock the doors, shut everything up. And then you'll just see everybody like marching over.
*  And then they'll start banging on the doors and the windows and the and the guys inside the house. Get out of here. You know, I can just just just drunks. It's just insanity. Like, but it's and it's weird because then you take the same people go into the woods. They sober up and it's just night and day.
*  That's so weird. So weird. And then, uh, yeah, it's a buddy. You see the effects of it. So like I was telling you earlier, it's pretty brutal. When I first went to the over there, there was like a little, you know, nice family. It was like Dasha and our young, you know, these and their two little kids. Well, the first time I was there, I got back or I met the family. You know, I lived with them in their teepee and all this and that. And then I went back to America.
*  Sure enough, right after I left a tree fell on their daughter out in the woods and killed her. And then they after that got, you know, started drinking a bunch, quit the nomadic way of life, started living in the village. I went back over there. The girl or the the guy got stabbed in some drunken brawl or whatever and was in the in the hospital.
*  Slowly recovered. He had this big old gash with a piece of glass. Someone had cut him open with slowly recovered and then went back to his village. The drinking continued. Sure enough, they killed him. They took his body to back to the morgue, which the the freezers had broken. Right. So it's in the middle of the summer. This body's there, but it was a murder. So they had to wait for the police to come and investigate, but it's way out in the middle of nowhere. So took like a week.
*  And it's like a week later. It was just brutal. Go over there. Had to, you know, pick up this guy who's your buddy. And his wife is helping me like dress this body because they're basically like, OK, we're done with the investigation. You can go bury them decomposing. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And the wife is helping you. Yeah. And the wife's helping. We like took care of his body, like pick him up and like skin slips off and all that stuff. And then take her. You know, we took care of him, buried it buried him. It was pretty rough. But then a year later I come back. She had gotten remarried, you know, kind of starting her life again. Turns out he hangs himself not long afterwards. So again, it's this one.
*  The woman has lost two husbands and her daughter. She is her and her son. I just found out a little while ago she got too drunk, passed out in the snow and died. So now it's just the one son left from this whole family. And you like hear those stories often up there. It's like really rough.
*  You know, but that's balanced with what is could be so beautiful. It's like such a juxtaposition because you're out in this life where you have like people are happy, you know, ultimate freedom and they're doing great. But when they but the village and alcohol just does this whole other thing to them. And it's like these people who are so beautiful, so nice, so friendly, you know, so open to you.
*  But you just see him suffering so much from this scourge. It's like, man, it's brutal. It's crazy that the scourge doesn't extend to the people that live in the forest. Yeah, once they get out in the woods, you know, they don't have the alcohol available and they don't. But even if they did, do you think they would drink it? It seems like yeah, they usually drink it. You know, like when they go to the village, they get it and then they'll take go out to the woods and they'll drink for a few days until it's all gone. And then it's also back to normal. Do you think it's a genetic thing? Like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like,
*  did they have that's been a good question. I've thought about that. You know, there's that there's that hypothesis like that maybe it is because people have been introduced to alcohol more recently that they're not, you know, can't process it as well.
*  But that was a thing. It could also there could you could also have the explanation. It's probably a combination of both that when you do like have a people that are largely stripped of their culture and they're like, you know, because even the event is cool as their way of life is, you know, they had,
*  you know, 70 years of communism where they came in and they collected all the best reindeer herders and said that they were like, cool locks or what, you know, like the bourgeois because they have too many reindeer sent them all to prison, you know, like collectivized all these reindeer herds, these family herds, they turned into like government herds, you know, so it's been like, their culture is not completely intact. And it's like, well, there might be enough cause just from that kind of thing to explain that.
*  Some of the alcoholism, but I imagine it's a combination of both, you know.
*  Yeah, I've always wondered that about the Native Americans, the same sort of situation, right? Like how much of it is despair for them being removed from their normal nomadic way of life? Right? Right. How much of it is just the fact that they don't have the genes to process alcohol because they didn't evolve with alcohol? Yeah.
*  You know, there's a story of Cynthia Ann Parker, who's on the wall out there, who was a quantum Parker's mother. She was kidnapped by the Comanche when she was nine and then recaptured by the Texas Rangers. I think it was the Texas Rangers when she was like 30 with a child. And she was begging to go back to the Comanches. She did not want to live like it. And she found the way of living that the settlers had was just pathetic.
*  She hated it. You know, the Comanche lived in a world where everything was magic and like the sky was a god, the wind was a god, like you worship nature, you lived off the land, you followed the buffalo herd, and then all of a sudden you're in a village.
*  Couped up in a house.
*  Yeah.
*  And you got to...
*  Yeah, and everybody's like pushing Jesus on you. You're like, Christ.
*  Man, it's the same thing over there. It's like, right, it's a juxtaposition of ultimate freedom in this beautiful way of life versus like you're in the village in this little house. You know, these people are never going to be good like in Russian society because they live in some remote village. No internet, nothing, you know, like, and then but they're also the ones that aren't connected to their way of life are also not going to be great, evenky, because they've just lived in this little house and drink, you know, a bunch.
*  So people get caught in that weird in between place.
*  And it seems like even if it's not cultural, there's some there's some thing that draws people to that way of life.
*  Well, they live like that. It's very satisfying.
*  Absolutely. And as my firm, as for my own experience, like, yeah, I'm not a native, you know, but I lived with them and it was awesome. And it like spoke to me deeply.
*  Same thing even on, you know, things like the alone show.
*  It's like, oh, man, this is what we're built for.
*  You know, like you really feel it. It's it's, you know, an interesting thing.
*  Like, I don't have like a great memory or, you know, I don't usually have good, very vivid or interesting dreams.
*  But when I'm in the forest, you know, it's like I have all these vivid dreams that seem really meaningful and powerful.
*  It's like my memory is way better.
*  I remember people that I long forgot just because you go so long without distraction.
*  You can really delve into your thoughts.
*  And yeah, it's a fascinating thing to experience.
*  And once you do, you kind of realize, you know, what's missing.
*  And it was interesting. Listen, you talk to like Elon Musk and as the, you know, inevitable march of progress moves forward, it's like we kind of lose things, but we don't actually know what we're losing.
*  You know, and so as far as like the natives and like one of the reasons I want to see them preserve their culture, culture and their old ways and take it forward is just as kind of a memory receptacle so that as things move forward, we can still connect, you know, with with what we've lost because it is a lot, you know.
*  Well, it seems like we're becoming something different.
*  It seems like we used to be this thing, this animal that figured out how to use tools and clothes and figured out how to live off the land and figured out how to live in harmony with nature.
*  And then we invented electricity.
*  Yeah, it changed a lot.
*  Yeah, I mean, then we invented something that allowed you to project media, like whether it's radio at first and then television.
*  And then we are connected in this way where the world is.
*  It's a smaller place in some ways because it's you're connected to everybody, but it's still the same size, really.
*  Right.
*  And it's also far more complicated because you get so much information.
*  There's so much shit.
*  Yeah, like Twitter, like I don't know if you want Twitter, but I actually saved myself from that.
*  Dip my toe into it every now and then just to peek at the fucking madness.
*  It's like a it's like a bunch of chimps with weapons just fighting in a box.
*  Yeah, it's madness.
*  I've appreciated your stance on like putting something up and forgetting about it, but it is it is hard to do that.
*  Of course, those are I mean, yeah, it's hard to not get sucked into social media, but it doesn't really.
*  Speak to you anyway, but it just like absorbs your time.
*  It absorbs your time in a negative way, though.
*  I don't very rarely get anything positive.
*  I get occasionally interesting stories from people that I follow and I appreciate that.
*  But the actual communication aspect of it, like communicating to me or me to them like, yeah, not interested.
*  I like this like in a way, even though this is digital, like you and I are sitting at the I don't even like when I do them remotely.
*  I only do them remotely because the pandemic or if I can't get in, that's why I wanted to show up.
*  Yeah, man, it feels unnatural.
*  Yeah, you like looking at people.
*  I want to be in the room with you.
*  You know, it feels better.
*  It's fun. Yeah, but it's that's a I think that and I think that's ironically because podcasts are a digital medium in a lot of ways.
*  It's one of the reasons why it resonates with people because they can tell that we are really having a conversation in a way that people don't have that much.
*  Like you don't really have three hour conversations with someone where you just don't look at your phone, just sit across from each other and talk to each other and then talk about all kinds of shit.
*  Yeah. Yeah, it's a beautiful thing.
*  It's like, yeah, you and you got to have that.
*  And it's like, yeah, that's one of the things you experience.
*  Like, you know, when I'm in the woods or on that, yeah, I was on that show.
*  It's amazing how little you miss social media.
*  Right. But then you don't miss it at all.
*  But then when you come back to life, it's still just like, yeah, it just sucks.
*  Pulling in. Yeah.
*  It's like a little demon whispering, come into the gutter.
*  It's like the clown from it.
*  Absolutely. Come on.
*  I'm not going to hurt you. Just do a little scrolling.
*  Yeah. Oh, nice thing you know.
*  It's really interesting that those people that live in the village are so close to the happy people.
*  Yeah. They're so close to the tiger. So close.
*  And those people in that Werner Herzog documentary, you watch it and you're like,
*  like, why is it? Why is it that people think there's part there's like a cynical aspect of our society
*  where they look at people that live like that, like, look at this dummy.
*  No electricity. He's got plastic windows. Yeah.
*  You know, because the bears might attack his house.
*  Yeah, I'm not living like that.
*  But meanwhile, he's not on antidepressants. You are.
*  He's not on, you know, he's not on Xanax. You are.
*  He doesn't drink before he goes to bed every night because he can't deal with life. You do.
*  It's cool because you're out there and it's like, you know, your creative juices flowing, you know,
*  like you get problems constantly coming up and it's like you got to think to solve them.
*  And they're all even that's probably how people like developed creativity.
*  It's like, how do I catch this moose or how do I do this or that?
*  And and you really just feel alive in that way. You really do.
*  Well, so many people have done it and like detached and then documented it.
*  Like, I'm sure you're aware of Dick Prenike. Yeah. Yeah.
*  So he's got there's a bunch of great videos of him before he died, where he, you know, he he moved up there.
*  I believe he had some sort of an industrial accident when he was like in his late 40s or early 50s
*  and almost went blind and then made the decision like, I'm not living like this anymore.
*  I'm going to get a fucking cabin. I just live in the woods and live off the land.
*  And there's something so universally appealing about that, where those videos are fascinating.
*  Watching him make his tools, build his house. Right.
*  And that's what that's a just to add to that. It's super appealing.
*  What's actually interesting about like native culture and stuff is you have that,
*  but you also have community because you've got like multiple teepees or whatever.
*  All these people and you're interacting with your family and loved ones while also,
*  you know, living in a. Yeah.
*  You're not out by yourself.
*  And they're all living that kind of fulfilled life. Right.
*  So you're all like feeding off it together.
*  You're very in touch with like the cycles of life.
*  Like it doesn't it didn't feel, you know, death feels more like a natural part of the.
*  You're always seeing it with the reindeer and with this and that, you know, there's always.
*  And it just feels more natural part of life.
*  It's less there's a little bit less existential angst, I would imagine, amongst the right.
*  The average nomad out there than there is here in L.A.
*  Yeah, I mean, look, dude, here in L.A., it's a fog that sweeps through communities,
*  particularly now because nobody could work.
*  This is the grossest I've ever seen it because just people are so angry and depressed and confused
*  and frustrated and and it's tough when everyone's in a mask and you don't get the personal connection
*  of like just seeing someone be like smile. And if you try going out in L.A.,
*  they'll scream at you if you don't have a mask on.
*  Put your fucking mask on.
*  I'm like I'm on the other side of the street, bitch.
*  They scream at you like nowhere near you.
*  The law.
*  Fucking everyone's judged dread.
*  It's like, come on, Jesus Christ.
*  Common sense.
*  Meanwhile, I was in Texas this last weekend.
*  Normal.
*  People say hi.
*  Shake your hand.
*  Everyone's walking around.
*  No mask.
*  Go to a restaurant.
*  They make the waiters wear masks.
*  But everybody else just everyone's fucking sitting there like normal people and seems fine.
*  Be interesting.
*  Just life has inherent risk.
*  Yeah, but they're like coronavirus cases rising in states that have opened early.
*  By how much?
*  Three people?
*  And they walk it off.
*  But of course it will rise.
*  But it's also like.
*  But yeah, we got you also got to live.
*  Yes.
*  And you really should go outside because that's probably one of the big reasons why you're going
*  to get sick in the first place.
*  Lack of vitamin D being cooped up, unhealthy lifestyle.
*  Absolutely.
*  All those things that are like a side effect of the city, the bad food, the sedentary lifestyle,
*  the lack of nutrients, all those things contribute to all those diseases.
*  And then people being stacked on top of each other.
*  Like think about where they got it the worst.
*  New York City.
*  Of course.
*  New York City, which think about how they live.
*  They live in this really weird way.
*  It's exciting.
*  It's fun.
*  A lot of action.
*  Yeah, a lot of energy.
*  Bam, bam, fuck you.
*  It was like, whoa, this is a crazy place to live.
*  But it's not normal.
*  Take someone from the Taiga and bring them to Manhattan before the pandemic.
*  And they'd be like, what is this?
*  Yeah.
*  What is this?
*  If you grew up there and you didn't know and you've never seen a TV, that would be a fucking trip.
*  It would be.
*  Oh my God.
*  You'd get so you'd be exhausted immediately.
*  There's a Vice Guy to Travel special online that you could watch on.
*  This guy, Heinmo, and he lives in Heinmo-Koth, I think his name is.
*  And he lives in really far north Alaska.
*  And it's Heinmo's Arctic Adventure is what it's called.
*  And this guy moved out there, I believe in the 70s.
*  He was working as a logger and he has a permit to have a cabin up there.
*  It's like the last guy to have a permit.
*  And he has like a permit on his door in case someone stops by because he's really not supposed
*  to live out there, but he's allowed to.
*  And he's a really intelligent guy, really articulate guy.
*  And he just talks about how he just hunts caribou and catches fish.
*  And he believes this is how people are supposed to live.
*  And he feels really connected and really healthy and happy.
*  And I mean, he looks great.
*  And it's like in his 60s, he's just wandering around hunting and fishing and occasionally
*  has to shoot a bear because it's fucking trying to steal his food.
*  But there's something about it that, again, this is not a guy who grew up like that.
*  But he just it resonated with him in a way that nothing else did.
*  My wife came with me to Siberia for spent a winter and a summer.
*  But it's like she's from New York City.
*  Oh, no way.
*  Yeah.
*  And she went out there and loved it.
*  You know, it's like a way better.
*  She could see what it was.
*  She could feel that connection.
*  It actually, interestingly, is a little tougher.
*  There's Heinemann.
*  There he goes.
*  And he lives up there.
*  And one of the things that he said that was really interesting.
*  So what's really funny is this dude who's with him is I guess you call him a millennial.
*  And it looks like a reporter.
*  Little fellow with glasses on.
*  He's probably never done this a day in his life.
*  But he's got balls because he went out there and lived with this guy for a little bit.
*  And he stayed in a tent and the whole deal.
*  But this guy had never seen 9-11.
*  Heinemann didn't know anything.
*  He never, never heard of it.
*  Living his life.
*  And then one day years later, I believe, he saw a photo of it.
*  It's like that Japanese guy that didn't know World War II ended.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  The guy on the island.
*  So this guy, this reporter lives with him for quite a while and sort of experiences the life.
*  And it's the same thing.
*  It's like there's something about it that resonates with you.
*  It does.
*  You see the way this guy lives his life.
*  You're like, wow, this is amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it's, I mean, obviously, there's a big,
*  for someone that grows up in a city or something, there's like a big hurdle to get over.
*  But I think it would be fairly, I don't want to say universal,
*  but I think a lot of people would really connect to it once you experience it.
*  Well, my friend Dan, Dan Doty, he actually takes people out,
*  and particularly kids, troubled kids, and takes them to the woods for extended periods of time.
*  Yeah.
*  Has them live off the land.
*  Yeah.
*  And as a therapy.
*  So you take these kids that have affluenza,
*  you know what that is?
*  Yeah, too affluent.
*  You grow up affluent.
*  You grow up, you grow up in-
*  That's a sickness problem.
*  It's a sickness.
*  You grow up with nannies, no connection to your father and all that kind of shit.
*  And they take them out to the woods.
*  And Dan has this whole, he's got some project he's doing.
*  I forget what it's called.
*  See, you can find it, Dan Doty, but he actually has extended this to men.
*  And there's these retreats that they do.
*  And essentially the idea is to just reconnect people with nature,
*  reconnect people with hard work and living in the forest in a natural way as a therapy.
*  And there's something incredibly, there it is right there.
*  What is it called?
*  Everyman.
*  Everyman, yeah.
*  And that's my buddy Dan, the guy on the right.
*  I've been hunting with him.
*  He used to be on the Meat Eater crew, and then now he's doing this.
*  And oh, that's me and him.
*  Yay.
*  There you go.
*  And Dan's just a great guy.
*  And it's a really interesting thing that he sort of felt like he had a calling
*  to introduce people to this sort of way of life as a therapy.
*  Just giving them a new perspective and letting them know that there's actually meaning to this.
*  This is not as simple as like, oh, let's go camping and be an asshole, fucking drink beer.
*  We tried a similar thing in Siberia where we took a bunch of the village young guys
*  that were just kind of drinking their childhood away.
*  Oh yeah?
*  Took them out onto that Ura guys trapping lands.
*  And how'd that go?
*  It just went well.
*  I mean, they all did great while they were out there.
*  Of course, it's like a temporary thing.
*  Unfortunately, when I left, a lot of them went back to doing the same thing they were doing.
*  But it gives people an opportunity.
*  That's all you can do.
*  You can't force anyone to change.
*  Yeah, you can show them the stream.
*  It's got to be hard because if you've experienced that way of life only briefly,
*  but the other way of life is very normal to you and your friends.
*  You just go back to your old friends.
*  Although that said, there was one dude that did a full 180.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's all you need.
*  Just one is a victory.
*  Exactly.
*  That's really out of how many people?
*  There was actually only like five that went out there.
*  That's pretty amazing.
*  So it's actually pretty good, I guess.
*  That's amazing.
*  That's great odds.
*  It felt not like a failure, but it just felt like potential.
*  Hey, man, 20%.
*  Well, yeah.
*  You have to look at it that way.
*  Excellent odds in that regard.
*  Fuck, that's incredible.
*  I mean, if you could get 100 people and 20 of them turn their life around,
*  that's as good as any therapy you're ever going to have.
*  As good as you could hope for, right?
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  I mean, how many people go to therapy for years and barely budge?
*  Right.
*  Yeah, that's absolutely true.
*  Yeah.
*  When you think of it that way, there you go.
*  Thanks for the new perspective.
*  So were you aware of Alone before you went to do it?
*  Yeah, I was.
*  I had watched it.
*  I don't watch much TV, but it happened to be the one show that I kind of liked.
*  So I watched the first two seasons and basically just sent them a link to my YouTube videos.
*  I was like, oh, you know, everyone watches it and like, oh, I could do that.
*  And then I forgot about it.
*  And then a few years later, they called me out of the blue.
*  Said, yeah, we want you on season six.
*  Well, it must be like Fear Factor.
*  When we were doing Fear Factor, we would get just not, I mean, I wasn't going through them,
*  but the people that were going through the casting folks, they would get just fucking
*  stacks and stacks of people trying to get on the show.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  It was impossible to navigate at all.
*  Yeah, dude, you'd have to get really lucky to even.
*  But they found you.
*  Yeah, they found me somehow.
*  And then I would think that they would think you were a little bit too good at it.
*  Yeah, I guess I don't know what they thought, but it was I was pretty happy when
*  I found out it was going to be in the north, you know, like, oh, awesome.
*  That's like that place.
*  How much money do you win when you win it?
*  Five hundred thousand.
*  Woo.
*  Nice little change.
*  Yeah, so it's definitely motivating.
*  It's a lot of a lot of manual labor to do that.
*  Yeah, especially 77 days worth.
*  Yeah.
*  If you could bang out a half a million seventy seven days, you're doing pretty
*  fucking not bad wages.
*  No.
*  Yeah, real good.
*  So when you sign up for the show, how much time in advance do they give you?
*  You probably hear maybe two, three months before they drop you off.
*  So when you hear, OK, you're going to I guess, you know, actually might be like a
*  month and a half from when they select you to when you get dropped off.
*  So when you knew you were selected and you knew you're did you do anything to prepare?
*  You do little things like I had been living with my family, you know, like I had
*  I haven't been in Russia for a few years because I had a few kids and doing the
*  whole family thing and found out I was going on.
*  I was like, oh, man, like I'm a little rusty on all this.
*  But mostly my main preparation was trying to put on weight, which is always not that easy for me.
*  So I was drinking like many calories as I could, trying to put on a little extra weight
*  and shooting the bow, you know, getting out there, shooting the recurve, trying to dial
*  in a little bit on that.
*  And why did you choose a recurve over a compound?
*  Because you're only allowed to recurve.
*  Yeah, it's got to be kind of primitive gear that you get.
*  OK, they want you to have a shitty bow.
*  Yeah, it would have been sweet with the compound.
*  Oh my God, yeah.
*  But no, it was cool.
*  So yeah, my preparations were mainly that, mainly just trying to put on weight, dial in on the bow.
*  Now, when you say try to put on weight, that was so that you could burn fat.
*  Yeah.
*  If you ran out of food.
*  Right.
*  Just so I had a little more reserves because I'm a skinny guy with a fast metabolism.
*  Like previous winners of the show had usually been bigger dudes that
*  had a lot of extra weight to lose.
*  You could live off your fat for a long time if you have water.
*  There's actually a guy, Rob Wolf.
*  Was it Rob Wolf that told us about this guy that had lived?
*  No, Dom D'Agostino told us about this guy who lived a ketogenic diet.
*  He fasted for three hundred and sixty something days.
*  He must have been huge.
*  He was fat as fuck.
*  But at the end of it was a normal size.
*  And what's really crazy is he didn't have the loose skin that plagues a lot of people that lose weight.
*  His whole body shrunk.
*  Yeah.
*  He became like a normal guy.
*  Good for him.
*  He lived off vitamins and water.
*  He took a vitamin drip and drank water and for a whole year ate no food.
*  Yeah.
*  And his body just lived off the fat.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a crazy story.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it takes willpower.
*  There you go.
*  I wonder what he did for just like hunger pangs and all that.
*  I don't think you get them.
*  I think after a while you don't get them.
*  Yeah, they do go away after a while.
*  And when you're that fat, I mean, you basically.
*  Switches.
*  Have a year's worth of food just carrying around.
*  Yeah.
*  I think he got down like 160 pounds and became a normal person.
*  Right.
*  Like it was morbidly obese.
*  Do you know it?
*  180 plus 276.
*  Good for him.
*  276.
*  That's crazy.
*  That's crazy.
*  You got to hold it off.
*  I wonder if they were able to keep it off.
*  You know, I know he's a fat fuck now.
*  Now he's 3000 pounds.
*  Just went back to donuts and only.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, I'm back in the day.
*  That's what he is that him.
*  Mm hmm.
*  It was in the 60s.
*  Oh, was it really?
*  Mm hmm.
*  Wow.
*  Looking sharp.
*  Yeah.
*  And like you say, he doesn't have like a lot of that skin.
*  No, he wasn't plagued with.
*  Is this this is the only time this was done was in the 60s?
*  When I typed it in, that's what popped up.
*  There's another guy fasted for 385 days, like a hunger strike or something.
*  But wow, look at what he used to look like versus what he looked like at the end.
*  That's nuts.
*  Yeah.
*  So I was I was I was self-conscious about my weight going on there.
*  Like I'm too skinny for this sport.
*  So what kind of stuff did you eat to pack on the calories?
*  Oh, I was just drinking olive oil and trying to get fat off of that.
*  Olive oil.
*  Yeah.
*  Really?
*  What kind of farts did you have from just drinking olive oil?
*  I would imagine your gastrointestinal system would be like, what are you doing?
*  Not like your homeland of Italy.
*  I'm just kidding.
*  Now, did you drink soda to try to get sugary?
*  No, gross.
*  Yeah, I tried drinking those weight gainer shake things, but man, those are brutal.
*  Yeah, you feel terrible.
*  All morning, I was just laid out.
*  They fucking just wreck you.
*  Oh, they do.
*  It's it's terrible stuff.
*  Yeah, those were like I remember back in my like right out of high school.
*  There's a lot of guys who are trying to put on muscle,
*  weight gainer stuff, and would come in this tub, this huge tub, and you had to put many scoops into
*  the shake and just fucking feeling in your stomach.
*  You just drank sand.
*  Just not meant to be at that point.
*  So you're just drinking olive oil.
*  Did you wind up putting on any weight?
*  Yeah, I got like 25 pounds or so.
*  So that was actually pretty good in like a month and a half or whatever.
*  That's pretty impressive because you're a really lean guy.
*  It was all fat.
*  And honestly, that weight went away really fast too when I was out there.
*  Just from the exercise and cold?
*  Yeah, just from running around.
*  I would imagine the cold alone.
*  Yeah, you burn.
*  I mean, I think it was about you average around a pound a day just losing weight.
*  That's kind of scary.
*  Yeah, so you kind of feel like the pressure is on to hunt some big game.
*  So do you have formal training with a recurve?
*  Do you know how to use it correctly?
*  No, I don't.
*  It's self-taught.
*  So I need to go meet up with Aaron and get some tips, right?
*  Well, that's why Aaron really got into it because he's such a good bow hunter with a compound that
*  he actually found it to be not as challenging as he needed and wanted.
*  And he wanted to kind of prove to himself and other people that he could do the same
*  with the recurve bow.
*  Yeah, no, recurve.
*  Yeah, that's awesome.
*  You've seen the videos he puts on?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  He's got these videos of him shooting bullseyes at like 45 yards, a recurve.
*  Right, right.
*  Kind of crazy.
*  That's really cool.
*  Yeah, I mean, I just practice getting better.
*  But you've got to practice a lot with that thing.
*  You do.
*  I did notice on that show, there's something about you by yourself and you need the food.
*  You get so concentrated.
*  You're so dialed in.
*  When I go shoot at a target, it's hard to really be fully focused.
*  But man, when you see the squirrel or the rabbit over there, it's just like,
*  you're so dialed in that I found I was pretty accurate out there, which was cool.
*  Were you using the point of the arrow, the tip of the arrow, were you using that as a guide?
*  When you aim?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Maybe it's a little more instinctual than that.
*  But yeah, it's the point of the arrow.
*  This part of your-
*  Aaron was trying to explain to me how he used it.
*  He actually, to a certain range, he knows where his 20-yard range is based on the point of his broadhead.
*  Oh yeah, yeah, that's a good idea.
*  I mostly was- I mean, I've done a lot of bow hunting too.
*  You're bringing it way up here and looking down the shaft of the arrow versus a recurve or a compound
*  where your string is much lower in your face.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, you're using the arrow to kind of guess the distance between the target and the top of your arrow.
*  And just, you know, like bow hunting just allows- gives you good experience with estimating range.
*  That's one of the most important things because with the recurve, you got a big arc.
*  So five yards off.
*  Because it's not going very slow.
*  Yeah.
*  It's going very slow.
*  So did you have a target that you practiced with while you were out there?
*  Not while I was out there.
*  I practiced a lot on just rabbits and squirrels, you know, every day.
*  Just got pretty dialed in.
*  And you had nine arrows?
*  Nine arrows, yeah.
*  Did you lose any?
*  I lost a couple, like shooting at squirrels and trees.
*  Oh, that's going to suck.
*  And they're just so tempting because they're up there like-
*  Nya-nya-nya-nya-nya-nya-nya.
*  And you're like, oh.
*  Now what about fat?
*  Like, I would think that you would need fat.
*  Well, yeah, you do.
*  And that's why you eat the whole animal, you know, suck the brain out of the rabbit, try to get every bit of fat you can get.
*  And I learned a lot about that out there because, I mean, I caught a lot of rabbits and squirrels early on,
*  but I still just lost weight as fast as if I wasn't eating.
*  It felt like-
*  Yeah, you know what rabbit starvation is?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  When I went out there, I was like, I wonder how long that takes.
*  Is that like a year?
*  But basically, it's as soon as you start eating rabbits.
*  But there's no fat on them.
*  Yeah, not much on them.
*  It was like maybe enough to make up for the energy I was expending by running around.
*  Like, I don't think I lost fat.
*  They were weight faster than someone that was just sitting there.
*  It was probably about the same.
*  But I was able to run around, have fun, you know, shoot.
*  My bow and like learn my land, see how animals were moving and stuff.
*  So you didn't have any supplies that you initially set out with in terms of like-
*  No food.
*  No food.
*  Yeah, it's a fascinating experience when the helicopter drops you off, flies away,
*  and you've never scouted this place before.
*  You didn't get to choose where you're at.
*  Wow.
*  And it just flies away and you're just like, wow, somehow I have to live here.
*  Did they scout it?
*  Yeah.
*  They did.
*  So they knew there was wild animals there?
*  Yeah, they scout out and basically try to find 10 spots that have some form of
*  potential sustainability on them.
*  Wow.
*  And then you got to try to unlock the key.
*  Did you have any filtration system for water?
*  No, I started by boiling all my water, but then I just slowly drank bits of
*  raw water until I could pretty much just drink raw water because it was a big old lake up in
*  the far north.
*  It's like, it's pretty clean.
*  And I didn't get sick, but-
*  I drank out of a lake once off of in Prince of Wales in Alaska.
*  Apparently it's high enough altitude so there's no beavers.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  It was still weird just dipping your canteen in a lake.
*  Strange.
*  I thought we had done in Siberia too and it's always even in like moss puddles.
*  It's like this yellow water, but they'll just dip right in and drink out.
*  Wow.
*  Now when you said you drank a little bit, that was to test to see if you get the shits?
*  Yeah, to see if I'd get mildly sick rather than chugging it to begin with.
*  Right.
*  So you boiled it first and then started sipping it a little bit and then eventually just were
*  drinking it.
*  Yeah, although another thing in the cold when you're trying to conserve calories like that,
*  you don't want to drink a lot of cold water so I'd heat it anyway.
*  Oh, it makes sense.
*  What did you do for shelter?
*  A tarp was one of the things we took.
*  So I built a little A-frame shelter just out of logs, covered it, chinked it with moss,
*  put the frame over.
*  I spent less time on shelter, more time like procuring food and hunting.
*  So it was a quick shelter, threw it up.
*  I knew, I mean, I've lived in a teepee in that weather so I like knew I was going to
*  be fine on the cold as long as I could provide enough calories to keep my body warm.
*  So how many days did it take you before you got an animal?
*  I got a rabbit on day one so that was nice and then I continued to get rabbits, but it was
*  23 days when I got a moose so that was...
*  Well then you're good.
*  Then you're good kind of.
*  That's like eight months of eating.
*  Yeah, I mean again I was amazed how much fat you eat.
*  I was counting my moose and being like, hmm, this isn't like an infinite supply of food here.
*  Because there's not enough fat.
*  Yeah, because you're definitely eating more fat than you are protein.
*  But plus I had a Wolverine come and pillage my stores of fat and stuff.
*  Yeah, I heard about this.
*  So how did that happen?
*  Where did you store everything?
*  Well, it was initially, to be honest, I didn't expect to see a Wolverine.
*  I never have and it just wasn't something on my consciousness.
*  And so when I got the moose, I put all the meat up on this shelf I built and thought,
*  man, if a bear comes, it'll be great.
*  I'll have a chance at a bear.
*  I'll wake up in the night and kind of be like a bait pile basically.
*  Plenty of fat.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And so I was maybe expecting a bear to come, but I went to sleep the first night I got
*  the moose and woke up and I came out and there were just tracks everywhere.
*  Somehow I hadn't woken up, but Wolverine's a lot slyer animal.
*  And he had come and pulled out all the kidney fat.
*  I had like a jug of kidney fat that I was just like, no.
*  Oh, no.
*  He ate all your fat?
*  He hauled off a full gallon jug packed with kidney fat.
*  I had other fat, but that was like weeks of fat there.
*  Did you find it?
*  No, it was rough.
*  And so then he was pretty excited, I'm sure.
*  Wolverine just kept coming back every day.
*  I figured, I don't know if they're like, I figured they were nocturnal, but sure enough,
*  I'd be like out there scraping my moose hide in the middle.
*  They'd come running up and like try to grab some meat and run off.
*  And I was like, holy smokes, this thing's bold.
*  Is this a photo of him?
*  Yeah, that's the one.
*  Where is he?
*  That's at my shelter there.
*  That's off the show.
*  There he is sneaking around.
*  But yeah, so he stole 35,000 calories, which is gold up there.
*  Oh, so you got some serious gear on.
*  You're wearing kuyu.
*  Yeah.
*  So you got real light clothes.
*  It's not naked and afraid, fortunately.
*  No, well, that's serious hunting gear you're wearing.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, and there's your A-pillar.
*  Yeah, there's that little one.
*  Is that when you pissed off, the moose fat?
*  Yeah.
*  A gallon of moose fat contains roughly 35,000 calories.
*  Wow, gone.
*  Gone.
*  Cunty little Wolverine.
*  You should have kept that shit in the little tent with you.
*  Yeah, I really should have.
*  I thought I would hear a bear coming,
*  but I didn't think of a Wolverine.
*  Then the, anyway, he kept coming every day.
*  And I knew it was going to be me or him kind of on that.
*  They're such scary little fucks.
*  I heard, I read, maybe Jamie could find it,
*  but that one killed a polar bear in the zoo a while ago.
*  A Wolverine?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I'm not shocked.
*  Ferocious little things.
*  I've seen them chase off bears.
*  Yeah, oh, they will.
*  I've seen videos of them chasing bears off of kills.
*  Wolves, all that.
*  Bears like, what the fuck?
*  Yeah.
*  They're just so ferocious.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're so durable.
*  They get bit by bears and wolves,
*  and they just fucking shake it off.
*  Yeah, cool animals for real.
*  Oh, yeah, man.
*  Such cool animals.
*  It's just a weird animal, right?
*  It is.
*  So ferocious.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And small.
*  Yeah.
*  You know?
*  Just making it on attitude out there.
*  Yeah, just fucking angry, biting him.
*  Little muscle ball.
*  Like when I-
*  Did you eat him?
*  Yeah, of course, if you shoot a wolf,
*  or you know, I was actually killed it with my axe.
*  But when you do that, you've got to eat the heart out of it.
*  So I cut it open and ate the heart.
*  Then I ate a drumstick, of course.
*  But it tasted like skunk.
*  So I was like, I'll save the rest for a rainy day.
*  How do you know what skunk tastes like?
*  Have you eaten skunk?
*  I just smelled him.
*  I was assuming.
*  No, they have a musky flavor to them.
*  I'm sure.
*  They're a fucking gross animal.
*  Yeah.
*  Imagine how much testosterone those little fucks must have.
*  Corsons are their veins.
*  They're so ferocious.
*  So you ate his drumstick, and that's it?
*  And the rest of it?
*  Yeah, and the organs for the vitamins.
*  Yeah.
*  Did you try to use the rest of them for bait for something?
*  No, I was just saving it for eating later.
*  I put it up on my storage cache.
*  Yeah, when it's a dark day, I'll eat that.
*  Yeah.
*  And you run out of mousse if it really does go a year?
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  So when you didn't have the fat, what was it like just eating?
*  Did you have some fat left over?
*  Oh, yeah, you still have a lot.
*  I mean, to be fair, there's still a lot of fat on a mousse.
*  Like, there was all the ribs, the butt, the rump has a big old thick layer of fat.
*  You got the bone marrow.
*  Oh, OK.
*  Yeah, that's all straight fat, the brain.
*  There's a lot of fat still, but that was kind of the easiest fat anyway.
*  It was sad, but not the end of the world.
*  It was mostly depressing in that I figured somebody else got something big,
*  and once I lose that, now I'm at a disadvantage again.
*  So then it put the fire under me to keep getting more.
*  So you killed him with an axe, but you shot him with a bow first, right?
*  Yeah, the Wolverine, yeah.
*  Like, you pinned him to the ground with the bow.
*  Yeah, he had come the night before and I had seen him behind a bush,
*  and I had my flashlight and I could see his eyes.
*  And I thought about firing an arrow in there, but I was like,
*  how surely he's going to come out and I'll get a better shot.
*  But he closed his eyes, snuck away, and I never saw him leave from behind the bush.
*  I was like, dang it, I missed my opportunity.
*  The next day I saw him again the next night coming down through some shrubs,
*  and I had set up some warning systems around, like cans on strings,
*  so I'd hear him coming.
*  And I heard like clang, clang, clang.
*  I was like, oh gosh, he got my bow, went outside.
*  Sure enough, he scurried down this hill, went behind a bush,
*  and I just sent my arrow in there this time.
*  Through the bush.
*  Through the bush, and so I don't know what it did going through there,
*  deflected off of some branches.
*  Yeah, pinned his leg, his back leg to the ground.
*  Top of the arrow was in the branches,
*  and it just gave me enough time to grab my axe, run over there.
*  He was just like, ah.
*  You know.
*  Is that him?
*  No, no, no.
*  No, yeah, it's just another one.
*  Those little guys.
*  Dude, you must have been so fucking terrified to run up to him, even with an axe.
*  It happened so fast.
*  Yeah, it wasn't a cool, like you picture me like killing it, like really, ah.
*  But it was like, ah.
*  Ah.
*  No, it was, it was.
*  Did you film all that too?
*  Yeah, but it was at night, so it's kind of grainy.
*  That's the crazy thing, right?
*  You're not just doing something, but you're also self-filming.
*  Trying to film, so you gotta like.
*  Did they give you tips on how to film?
*  Yeah, they give you film tips before you go out.
*  I actually found, like this wasn't everyone's experience,
*  but I found it was like kind of nice to have a camera,
*  because when I'd been like fur trapping in Siberia,
*  it's like you're just alone alone, and everything you do just feels like
*  nobody's ever gonna know about it.
*  You know, like you do all these cool things and you.
*  I remember like I'd been out there for a few weeks,
*  and I came into like this beautiful woods in Siberia, you know,
*  and I remember being like, wow.
*  And then I was like, oh weird, that was the first time I've spoken out loud in like three weeks.
*  You know, so I was like.
*  So it's just saying wow.
*  Yeah, wow, like caught my attention.
*  Oh, that was my voice, you know, like, and then of course your mind's really active,
*  but it's just all in your head.
*  But on the show with the cameras, you know, it's like you're constantly like talking about stuff.
*  So it kind of made me feel like I wasn't quite as alone.
*  So when they tell you and they give you the camera equipment and tell you to go out and film yourself,
*  how much battery life do you have?
*  Well, you get this big like car battery size pack that you can like recharge your batteries with,
*  and then they'll occasionally come on like med checks to see,
*  make sure you're not too skinny or something like that.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  How often do they check on you?
*  It varies sometime around 10 days ish or something.
*  Every 10 days, oh, he's dead.
*  Yeah.
*  Have they had people die out there?
*  Not yet.
*  Fortunately, they give you a bell to ring or something.
*  Do you have a thing that you like, it's the thing you would give up with,
*  like if you were ready to tap out a garment.
*  You can send texts on it.
*  So you text them every morning and night and basically say, I'm okay.
*  And so they know you're okay.
*  If you don't do that, then they'll come probably see if you're alive still.
*  Oh, wow.
*  And so I would imagine their show is entirely dependent not just on you
*  succeeding, but documenting everything.
*  Yeah.
*  I think they were very clear with us like, you guys have to document everything.
*  We need eight hours of footage a day minimum.
*  And when you're out there.
*  Do you have a solar charger?
*  No, no.
*  So but it probably wasn't a lot of sun up there that time of year.
*  But that big battery block and then you got a lot of little packs, battery packs.
*  It's kind of what restricts where you live is that you have 100 pounds of gear.
*  So when you're swinging an axe at this Wolverine, you've got all that on film?
*  Yeah.
*  Even the shot?
*  Yeah. Well, you can see me.
*  It's like I'd like, because I heard him coming.
*  I heard him coming.
*  And because my cans were a long ways away, you know, a ways away.
*  And it's like, oh, geez, I just ran out with my tripod.
*  My camera set it on in because he had a trail.
*  So I knew generally where he'd be coming.
*  So I just set my camera up, put it in that direction.
*  And that's kind of where he came.
*  So that would be a giant distraction.
*  Yeah.
*  That would make it so because I know I missed the first moose because
*  there was a different moose that I had shot at that I totally missed.
*  But big giant dinosaur of a moose.
*  It was so cool to see.
*  But I grabbed my bow and arrow and my camera and ran out there, set the camera up,
*  took my shot and I was like, oh, I didn't grab my quiver.
*  And so my first shot, I misjudged the distance and dropped the arrow between his legs.
*  I was like, oh, oh, no, I only grab one arrow because I grabbed my stupid camera.
*  Did he run when the arrow came near him?
*  No, I dropped between his legs.
*  He looked around.
*  I totally would have had time for another shot.
*  It was a real kick in the pants.
*  So then I got he kind of took out trotted off and I was just like, man.
*  Did he know you were there?
*  Was he aware of you?
*  Not too aware.
*  I took a shot.
*  He heard it, knew something was up.
*  What had happened is I had set again those cans up as a warning system.
*  And I heard him in the morning hit the cans.
*  And I figured that would just warn me.
*  If something hit the cans, it would wake me up and I could go out and try to hunt it.
*  What actually happened is he went through the cans, scared himself, and ran perfectly
*  in my direction and turned around and looked at the cans.
*  Broadside to me, I came out and it was just a perfect shot.
*  But it was 40.
*  I paced it off afterwards, 43 yards.
*  And he was such a big animal that I thought he was closer.
*  So I put him at 30 yards, guessing.
*  And I missed my first and only shot.
*  Did you call him in?
*  Yeah, I've been calling moose.
*  Every day I would just pick berries, call moose.
*  Good one.
*  That's very good.
*  I think they'd come.
*  Get it in your lungs.
*  I learned that from my friend Mike Hawkridge.
*  Now when you're doing that, you're waiting a long time, right?
*  You're calling them and then you just sit there and wait?
*  I'd find a good berry patch, just sit there and eat berries and call.
*  Yeah, and that's all I would do.
*  I think both the bull moose that I saw came into that calling.
*  But it would take them a long time.
*  So I'd call all evening and then they would usually come in in the morning,
*  which was interesting.
*  So it's not like they-
*  They come from miles.
*  Yeah, they must have come from a long ways away.
*  They come huffing and puffing all in the rut and stuff.
*  They're so vocal.
*  It's nice you can mimic their voice with your voice.
*  It's not like an elk where you need a tube.
*  You can actually make the horny cow moose noise.
*  Exactly.
*  Just got to get into it.
*  Was it in the rut?
*  Yeah.
*  That's lucky.
*  Was that on design for them?
*  They want to give you a chance of getting something.
*  Now, you shot that moose.
*  How did the other people survive?
*  And how many people made it to you?
*  A lot of people just through toughness, just starving out.
*  Dude, you were pointing out.
*  Just catching a few rabbits here and there.
*  Fishing is a big thing.
*  But yeah, it was nice to have the moose for sure.
*  Oh, I can only imagine.
*  I knew I had to.
*  It was like I'm not going to have a chance.
*  If it was starving, I would have been out of there so fast.
*  Did anybody else get a moose?
*  No.
*  I assumed someone would.
*  But again, with a recurve, it's pretty hard.
*  Plus, you haven't ever scouted your territory,
*  so you don't know how things are going.
*  Because I was so focused on getting one right from the bat,
*  right when they dropped my helicopter off,
*  it was like I went out and scouted where might moose come in?
*  Did you bring binos?
*  No, you can't take those.
*  You can't take those.
*  I just put my shelter where the wind would always be blowing my scent out to the sea.
*  And taking into account all those little things.
*  Building my shelter away from where moose might walk by
*  so that I wouldn't blow up a spot.
*  So how did the other people, what did they eat?
*  Did you talk to them after it was over?
*  Afterward.
*  Someone made it to 77 days before they quit.
*  72 or 73.
*  So they let you go an extra four days?
*  Yeah, because a storm came in and they couldn't get out there.
*  Did you know about it?
*  No, I had no idea.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Plugging along.
*  So who the fuck made it to 72 days?
*  It was a girl named Wonia and she and another guy named Nathan made it.
*  His shelter burnt down and that was kind of the end for him.
*  Both of them made it right up to 71, 72 days.
*  His shelter burned down, he said, I'm not making another one.
*  Yeah, I mean, it was cold at that point.
*  It'd be pretty tough.
*  There's a girl.
*  Yeah.
*  Look at her.
*  She caught something with her bow, like a little game pheasant or something.
*  Oh, and she's sad?
*  She's happy, I think.
*  Happy to finally eat.
*  Yeah, then she cooks it up.
*  Wow.
*  She's chopping it all up.
*  Yeah, and so yeah, they would eat, you know, as everybody did.
*  Look how red that is.
*  You just eat everything.
*  How crazy red that bird's meat is.
*  That's nuts.
*  It looks like a beef.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It looks like a venison bird, doesn't it?
*  Yeah.
*  It's crazy.
*  Look at her.
*  So happy.
*  Oh, I'm so happy.
*  So she almost made it.
*  Yeah, she did really well.
*  Some fucking ballsy people to do this.
*  Yeah, it's pretty intense.
*  You know, like good for everybody that tried.
*  Because you get like...
*  Yeah, but they don't get shit.
*  It's pretty intense.
*  They get zero.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  They get boom-gotts.
*  You get 72 days of starving, lady.
*  I know.
*  It's rough.
*  And one guy walks away with a half a mil.
*  Yeah.
*  That's crazy.
*  How much mousse did you have left at the end of the show?
*  A couple hundred pounds.
*  You know, like I still had a lot.
*  You were good to go.
*  How many pounds of it were you eating in a day?
*  As much as I could.
*  I was just so hungry.
*  Plus, I was having fish.
*  So I would have fish for lunch and then more breakfast and like dinner.
*  I would eat mousse and I was just...
*  I basically told myself, well, I can't quit until I finish this whole mousse.
*  Let me eat it as fast as I can.
*  So how were you catching fish?
*  You brought a homemade pull?
*  Yeah, I caught most of them on...
*  This is a birch pole.
*  I'd rigged up a little thing that made me so I could cast and I could cast a long ways out.
*  And it was the funnest fishing I've ever done.
*  You could cast?
*  Yeah, I made with like a spool that I'd brought for my fishing line or whatever.
*  And what did you use for like the eyes for the...
*  Wire.
*  A snare wire was one of the things I brought.
*  So I'd made like a rigged up a little fishing pole and it worked great.
*  It was real similar to what they use in Soviet, like old Soviet reels.
*  So I had been...
*  It gave me the idea for making that style of a reel because they're just so basic.
*  And it takes a little practice to use.
*  But anyway, I rigged it up, it worked great.
*  I could cast way out there.
*  It took me a long time to catch my first fish a few weeks.
*  But after I did, I kind of like dialed them in and it was such fun fishing.
*  Were you using bait or lures?
*  I made a lure, like a little spinner I made.
*  And I caught a fish, but it snapped my line.
*  And then I tried moose meat and they loved it.
*  I would just be casting in on...
*  Catching them all on moose meat or like fish belly.
*  You catch a fish and cut out a strip and they loved that.
*  And it was mostly lake trout, but some of them were over 20 pounds.
*  And you got this homemade rod and you're like reeling it in, shaking your hands out.
*  It was so fun.
*  20 pound lake trout.
*  That's insane.
*  With a homemade lure and a homemade...
*  What kind of string are you using?
*  That's a different thing.
*  That's paracord.
*  I was just testing out making a fly line out of paracord there.
*  And did you have a leader as well?
*  Using the paracord and braiding it down.
*  That's not the thing I used on the show.
*  That was just experimenting.
*  Now when you were using the line, what kind of line...
*  Did you bring fishing line?
*  Yeah, that was another item I brought.
*  Like braided line?
*  No, you can only bring monofilament and barbless hooks.
*  So it made everything that much more intense.
*  Why barbless hooks?
*  It's Canadian regulations or something.
*  There was never going to be any release in that situation anyway.
*  That's why it's so confusing.
*  Why would they have barbless hooks?
*  But they allowed you to...
*  What pound test did you use?
*  20.
*  Oh wow.
*  So you're like at the limit with the lake trout.
*  And you got no drag so you're just kind of going on field.
*  Yeah, it was very fun.
*  Wow.
*  Did you try to drag it out like a fly rod where you let it slip through your fingers a little bit?
*  Reel it in, let it pull away until it finally wears itself out.
*  Are you stripping the line in or do you have something...
*  I had my little reel so I could put my thumb on it, on my spool, and it would drag.
*  Oh wow.
*  And then I could reel it.
*  Did you reel it with a finger?
*  Yeah.
*  I made, when it was cold, I made this rabbit fur glove that where just the tip of my finger stuck out.
*  Oh wow.
*  And then...
*  Yeah, I gotta say though that was fun.
*  So how many fish did you want attention?
*  There's 13, but they're all big.
*  You know, like they're all...
*  So you can eat them for a couple days.
*  Yeah, like from between probably 8 and 20 something pounds.
*  Did you eat the fish guts at all?
*  Did you...
*  Yeah, like I ate the stomachs and the head was the best part.
*  Like when you're out there starving and you need fat, it's like a lot of times I would eat the fish
*  and kind of put the main meat part of it away for later.
*  But you need the belly, the head, all the fatty parts.
*  Did you make like a soup with the head?
*  Yeah, I made all my fish into soup and then I would fry all my moose basically.
*  Oh, no kidding.
*  All your fish you made into soup?
*  Yeah, just to get all the nutrients out of the bones.
*  Did you find any editable vegetables or anything?
*  Lots of berries like up north.
*  So it's awesome as far as berries go.
*  Although my spot didn't really have many, but I found patches, you know, like...
*  Oh, where you find berries, you find bears too.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Did you find any root vegetables or any like wild onions?
*  Not much.
*  There's not a lot of that up there.
*  There's lichen, so I boiled reindeer lichen.
*  Oh, that's...
*  What does that taste like?
*  Real bland.
*  It's really kind of acidic.
*  It's not great for eating, but I would mix it with my moose meat just to get carbs,
*  like some kind of carbs maybe.
*  That's what all the caribou eat, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, that's weird.
*  It's weird, but you can turn into an animal, you know?
*  Yeah.
*  Just take a pile of lichen and it turns into a reindeer.
*  It's weird stuff too, right?
*  Yeah.
*  So that was...
*  You have no seasoning or anything, right?
*  Right, but man, I got to tell you, I didn't...
*  You know elk too, but man, I didn't miss it at all.
*  It was so good from the first bite to the last.
*  Oh, moose.
*  I was just like, man.
*  Moose is so delicious.
*  Every time, it's just like, mmm.
*  Just moose over fire.
*  Yeah, totally.
*  Did you eat some of it raw?
*  Yeah, like the liver.
*  You ate that raw?
*  Yeah, just for the extra boost.
*  You had a knife, obviously?
*  A Leatherman, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, just a Leatherman?
*  Just a Leatherman.
*  So you butchered the moose with a Leatherman?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Holy shit.
*  How long did that take?
*  I think I got the moose finally at noon, and then I think I was done cutting it up and hauling it by 10 o'clock that night.
*  Do you have a sharpening stone or anything?
*  Yeah, just a rock.
*  Just a regular rock that you find laying around?
*  Yeah, I find one that looks like it might work well.
*  Oh, did it work?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  We're good.
*  Wow.
*  That's so crazy to rely on a Leatherman, that little tiny-ass blade.
*  Yeah, but you got only so many items, and I wanted the wire cutters.
*  I wanted the little saw for crafting stuff.
*  So I figured if my worst problem is that I have a small knife to cut up a big game, I'll be pretty happy.
*  Was there anything that you wished you brought that you didn't?
*  Yeah, I would have taken probably a gill net instead of my saw.
*  I took a saw, and I almost never used it.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  And you thought you would use it for trees?
*  Yeah, I just thought it'd just be a calorie saver rather than using your axe, but it was kind of a risk I took, and it ended up not being worthwhile.
*  So that was only one.
*  That's pretty good, though.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  It was nice for building.
*  I built like a 12-foot tall cache where I stored all my moose meat and stuff.
*  It was nice for that.
*  So what other objects did you bring?
*  You brought a tarp, you brought a fishing line.
*  Fishing line.
*  Oh, there it is.
*  Fucking James the best.
*  Ferro rod.
*  What is a ferro rod?
*  That's like that sparker.
*  You know, you scrape it and it sparks.
*  Oh, so that's how you started your fires?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Hmm.
*  Fishing line and hooks, all barbless.
*  How many hooks did you have?
*  25.
*  Ooh, that's scary.
*  But yeah, no, they go fast.
*  77 days, 25 of all the chink.
*  That was down to my last ones.
*  A bow and you're allowed nine arrows only.
*  Yeah.
*  Did you think about constructing arrows?
*  Yeah, I thought, and I was thinking, by the time I got the moose, it was early enough
*  that I didn't really need to make arrows, but I was thinking if I want to shoot more
*  at squirrels, I better make some arrows.
*  Trapping wire, what is that?
*  That's just thin gauge wire, like 20 gauge wire.
*  And what did you use that for?
*  For snare and rabbits, I put hundreds of snares out.
*  For building my fishing pole, stuff like that.
*  And did that in a sleeping bag?
*  Yeah, a sleeping bag.
*  You must have brought a fucking warm sleeping bag, right?
*  Minus 40, and then you heat up rocks, throw it in there with you.
*  Oh, OK.
*  And then a multi-tool.
*  Crazy, you didn't bring a knife, just a multi-tool.
*  Wow.
*  I guess that makes sense, though.
*  If I was looking at that list, what would I take off for a knife?
*  Yeah, it's kind of redundant.
*  If you didn't have the saw, what would you take if you didn't have the saw?
*  I probably would have taken a gill net.
*  I ended up making a gill net out of the paracord, but I think that would have been useful.
*  Wow, that's crazy.
*  You only get 10 things.
*  Yeah, it puts the pressure on, for sure.
*  Oh my goodness, it does.
*  So once you shot the moose and you knew you had all that meat,
*  and then what did you do with your time after that?
*  Oh, I kept busy.
*  I just always assumed somebody else was going to get something.
*  So I spent a lot of time right after getting the moose,
*  preserving it, smoking it, trying to store it where it would be safe.
*  Because everywhere you put it, something's getting it.
*  You hang it in trees and the birds are pecking it.
*  Everybody's going for it.
*  Did you have a tarp that you could cover it with?
*  Well, I only had the tarp for my shelter.
*  That was an item I also thought, had I known I was going to get something big,
*  it would have been nice to have a tarp.
*  It was a lot of work protecting my meat, but then also just continued fishing,
*  continued all that kind of stuff.
*  After you got the wolverine out of the picture, was there any other animals?
*  I thought, man, after I got the wolverine, I was so happy.
*  I was like, yes, I just got to eat and live.
*  And then two days later, I was sitting there frying up some meat.
*  And I've never been able to find on the internet a good wolverine sound.
*  But another one came and I just hear it out in the woods.
*  Now it's like a witch in the woods.
*  It's just like, yeah.
*  And I was like, oh, did I?
*  I was just praying, like, oh, I think I made that up, right?
*  I didn't really hear that.
*  Like a dream.
*  Yeah, but sure enough, he started coming around.
*  But we have regulations, right?
*  So you can't kill, you can only kill one wolverine.
*  So I was like, yeah.
*  So then I was just on defense mode trying to set up like,
*  I'd like set up all these cans so that when I walked through with the, you know,
*  it clank and then I'd wake up and chase it away.
*  Shut that camera off.
*  We're going commando on this wolverine.
*  It's tempting for sure.
*  Oh, 100%.
*  I mean, I just like that survival.
*  It is.
*  This isn't just hunting.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  You're trying to survive.
*  Man, talk about intense hunting.
*  When I hit the moose, you know, like,
*  unlike anything I've ever experienced, you're like, oh my gosh, that was a good shot.
*  And you're just like, oh.
*  But then you got to wait, you know, you got to wait like an hour to go look
*  because you don't want to spook it.
*  It's such a big animal.
*  How heavy were your arrows?
*  Let's see, I had 180 point grain.
*  Broadhead.
*  So heavy.
*  I mean, 125 grain broadheads and 80 grain insert.
*  Oh, okay.
*  So pretty heavy up front.
*  Heavy FOC.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And then like all the shafts.
*  What kind of shafts?
*  Full length shaft.
*  Carbon?
*  Like what do you use?
*  Yeah, carbon wood look like shafts.
*  Feathers?
*  Yep, with feathers.
*  And yeah, did the job.
*  It sunk all the way in to the moose entirely and didn't come out.
*  Because it was a quartering towards me shot.
*  Oh, wow.
*  And it sunk the feathers in.
*  The back of the arrow touched its back hip.
*  So you must have shot it perfect between the ribs.
*  Yeah, it was great.
*  But I only hit one lung, so it was a long, you know, of course I was tracking it.
*  Lost track of the blood.
*  It was like a big ordeal tracking that thing down.
*  And then you got to worry about something finding it before you.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  What would you do if a fucking bear found it?
*  Hunt the bear, I guess.
*  I mean, I was expecting a bear to show up and never did.
*  But you never saw any bears while you were there?
*  No, my spot must not have had bears.
*  Like I was expecting one to come for the kill.
*  Maybe they hibernated, you know, right around that time.
*  So it was like right on the edge of when they would go in.
*  And yeah, just got away with that one.
*  Or, you know, I actually, to be honest, was kind of hoping one would come.
*  Because it's so much fat.
*  What did you eat first when you got the moose down?
*  I loved the heart.
*  Heart's delicious.
*  Yeah, with that ring of fat around it.
*  Yeah.
*  So good.
*  And how did you cook that?
*  Just sliced it.
*  Sliced it and fried it.
*  Put on sticks or something?
*  I had one of my items with a frying pan.
*  Oh, that's right.
*  Oh, that's nice.
*  Man, it was so good.
*  Did you use the fat as like oil?
*  So you like cooked the fat first?
*  Cooked it first.
*  I rendered a bunch of fat into like, you know, oil.
*  Wow, you must have felt like a fucking caveman.
*  Like a successful caveman.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  It was interesting to get into that mindset because you're just,
*  you know, you're just living.
*  You feel really connected to everything.
*  You feel like.
*  Out there carving stakes with a leather man.
*  Yeah.
*  That is so crazy.
*  And did you use the axe to chop up the bones to make marrow?
*  Yeah, just break open the bones with rocks out on a rock.
*  And then pick out the marrow.
*  And that was, that's so good.
*  Raw or did you cook it?
*  Raw.
*  Yeah, cold and raw.
*  So good.
*  Creamy and delicious.
*  So healthy for you too when you're out there, right?
*  Yeah, it's exactly what you're craving.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  So when you had that stashed in your cache,
*  a lot of pressure must have been relieved though, right?
*  Oh yeah, it felt like just a demon lifted off my back.
*  It's just like, you know, the whole time you're like,
*  you're going to starve, you're going to starve, you're going to starve.
*  You're just like trying to fight this thing off.
*  And then, man, when you shot that and it was like three hours, I tracked it and I had lost it.
*  So I lost its blood trail and I lost its foot trails because it was like hard ground.
*  And I was just like, no, I cannot lose this moose.
*  And then, but I was like, well, I hit it in the lung, I'm sure.
*  So I think it's going to stay downhill.
*  So I just followed the shoreline.
*  Sure enough, I came up on it, but it was like sitting there alert and alive.
*  Still alive.
*  Yeah.
*  And I was just like, oh man, a duck down has like debating, like,
*  can I sneak in and try to get another shot?
*  But no way.
*  And it's like, so I just waited it out.
*  And it was a long three hours where I would just be like sitting there and it would stand up.
*  And you're just like, no, no, no, no, no.
*  Then it would fall down and you're like, yes.
*  And then it's like really dragged it out.
*  But when it finally died, yeah, walked over there and I, yeah,
*  talk about a weight lifted off your shoulders.
*  Do people give you a hard time for that?
*  Oh, yeah, I got some good internet hate.
*  But honestly, it's people I can understand it.
*  Like it sounds good.
*  Like, why don't you go finish it off with an arrow?
*  It could run away.
*  Of course, it could run away.
*  You can't even let it know that you have an arrow.
*  You got to let it be calm and just like go away.
*  How close were you when you saw it standing up?
*  How many yards?
*  50 yards, probably.
*  So you really don't want to send 150.
*  Yeah.
*  All you're going to do is poke it and then it's going to know it's being attacked and get up and run away.
*  And I understand the people that were mad just having bow hunted.
*  So fair enough.
*  Yeah.
*  And also it's survival.
*  It's not just regular bow hunting.
*  You can't make any risks.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a crazy situation, man.
*  Yeah, it was intense.
*  God, the anticipation.
*  That's even more crazy, right?
*  Like you hit it, but it's still alive.
*  And then you're hoping you can get that moose.
*  I've lost.
*  I don't know if you've ever done that where I've hit a deer.
*  You wait 45 minutes and then you go out there and then you see it stand up in front of you and run off.
*  And at that point, it's almost impossible to find because it's already bled out mostly.
*  And I've lost you that way.
*  The adrenaline kicks in.
*  Yeah, and they can run for miles.
*  It's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  They're built for survival, man.
*  They're built to get away from wolves.
*  It's amazing what they can do too.
*  So that was in my mind for sure.
*  Do you have the antlers?
*  Unfortunately, no.
*  Maybe somebody in Canada is listening to this.
*  I was flying out on the airplane and the lady wouldn't let me bring them on the plane
*  because I had them like improperly wrapped, I guess.
*  My plane was just about to leave from Northwest Territories and I just had to set it in front
*  of the airport.
*  And I was like, ah, what a super bummer.
*  I didn't have any of the locals numbered.
*  Like, hey, could you come grab this for me?
*  It was just, ugh.
*  That would be something you'd want on your wall for the rest of your life.
*  Absolutely.
*  That was a sad one.
*  Was it a big moose?
*  No, it was like a young moose, which great eating, but it wasn't huge.
*  But the first one was a monster.
*  Yeah, the first one was a monster.
*  And whatever, that was, I mean, have you seen moose up close?
*  No, I shot one.
*  Oh, you did?
*  I shot a young one.
*  Yeah, but it's aren't like cool animals to see.
*  The young one that I shot was like a forky.
*  It was like 900 pounds.
*  Yeah, that's about what I got.
*  Three points on it.
*  Like, yeah.
*  But yeah, they're just such cool animals to see.
*  They're so big.
*  Yeah, so big.
*  I was with my friend Ben O'Brien and he shot one that was huge.
*  When it was walking across the road, it walked across this dirt road.
*  It looked like a dinosaur.
*  That's exactly what I thought.
*  Didn't look real.
*  Even the one I missed, like, I can't even say I was upset because I was just like,
*  that was so awesome to see.
*  You know, like, that was really like seeing a dinosaur.
*  You don't realize how big they are until you're in their presence.
*  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
*  I guess that's probably like all animals that are enormous in Africa, right?
*  I mean, you see them at the zoo.
*  They're not impressive for some reason.
*  Yeah, they don't have their like wild energy in the forest.
*  And you know where they are.
*  It's like, look at the map.
*  Oh, there's the giraffe cage.
*  Let's go check out those motherfuckers.
*  Yeah, not as interesting.
*  No, it's not like you turn a bend, you know, go around a corner and you like see one.
*  You're like, what?
*  It's just out there living wild.
*  It's so indescribable.
*  Just seeing something, even if you just stumble into any kind of animal that's like in the wild.
*  And you realize like this is how this thing species has been existing for hundreds of
*  thousands of years.
*  Just how when we were when we were doing that project trying to get, you know, guys from
*  to stop drinking out in Siberia, we had like a little hunting cabin.
*  We were based at and I woke up one morning and we had a stupid dog.
*  That just barked at everything.
*  And I just hear the dog on roughness, like a squirrel.
*  So I got up and I didn't get up.
*  I let it bark.
*  And then my buddy got up like an hour later and went out to brush his teeth and came running
*  back in.
*  He's like, there's a bear out there.
*  So I went up, jumped up, looked out and a bear had killed a moose like less than 100.
*  We could have watched the whole thing if I would have just woke up right away.
*  But it came killed a moose right next to our cabin.
*  When we came out, it saw us and took off running and we were like, oh, man.
*  So we walked over there like, she's a whole warm moose still here.
*  So we like cut it up, haul it back to our camp, stole it from the bear, from the bear.
*  Did the bear come back?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Like three days later, like we were in the in our shelter.
*  And sure enough, that one dog just came running in and hide, hid under the bed.
*  The other one started like out there barking like, it's a we grabbed the SKS and go out
*  there.
*  And it felt like like have you seen the ghost in the darkness?
*  Yeah, that's what it reminded me of because it's like all this tall brush and you just
*  hear like, you know, the dogs barking over here and some like, oh, man, the bears over
*  here and then over here, you hear a oh, crap, it's over here, you know, like, and then all
*  of a sudden, like, man, we're kind of in this tall brush like better.
*  But I like was like, well, I got my camera.
*  So I handed the gun to this dude and he's just like, I figured he knew what he was doing
*  with bad choice.
*  But I got my camera.
*  He got the gun.
*  And then again, we're looking at where the dogs barking and the bear like pops up right
*  here and stands up.
*  It's like, and dude just took off running with the guy.
*  And I had recently camera.
*  Yeah, I left with my camera.
*  I had recently had a knee surgery.
*  It's like I wasn't running out of there.
*  So I just like stood there and ducked back in the brush.
*  And then dude comes back like a full, you know, almost a minute later.
*  I was just like there.
*  Give me that gun, pussy.
*  He's like, my knees are shaking.
*  I was like, dude, you got a gun.
*  Don't run.
*  And just as I said that, it stood up again and he's like, dude, you just sounded like
*  Vietnam is shot.
*  And he shot it.
*  So you guys want to be eating it?
*  Well, we I was with they were all a Venky people and we ate the heart, but they don't
*  eat.
*  They have like a whole ritual when they shoot a bear.
*  It's like the because they're so wormy up there.
*  You can't eat them in like a serious situation.
*  But what they would like, they like cut the head off and put the eyes under a rock because
*  they didn't want the like spirit to see where where who got it.
*  So they put the other parts of it in the river so that it floats down to like a different
*  village so that the bear thinks those are the people that got all these weird, weird little
*  things.
*  But in general, because there's so so much trick and oh, so some stuff, they don't eat
*  the brown bear up there.
*  But although you can if you boil the heck out of it.
*  Yeah, or just cook it over 160.
*  Right.
*  I guess.
*  I don't know.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  My friend, we got a trick and oh, did he Steve vanilla?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Or no.
*  Yeah, he got it.
*  He was told the whole crew got it and they even got t-shirts.
*  Isn't that mild trick and oh, this crew.
*  Isn't it?
*  Is it did they get rid of it?
*  I imagine it just goes away, but it's always in your body.
*  So somebody ate him someday.
*  They would get trick and oh, so interesting.
*  Yeah.
*  But he said it felt like his muscles like you could feel the little the little parasite
*  worms.
*  Yeah.
*  Burrowing into your muscles.
*  So everything is in pain.
*  Yeah.
*  And then eventually it just goes away.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Well, it goes away.
*  Fucking worms just living in your body.
*  It's creepy, man.
*  Because when you I haven't experienced this, but I know that some people who eat bear have
*  cut open the bear and seen the worms literally crawling underneath the skin.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  No, you could see him even on the bear that bear.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You'd see him in there.
*  They're like, yeah, it's pretty gnarly.
*  So you guys ate the heart only.
*  That's it.
*  Just the heart.
*  To me, it seemed a little bit of a waste, but yeah, that's just I was kind of doing
*  that when in Rome, you know.
*  Yeah, that's one of those things, right?
*  Like if you insult them and fuckers, they don't even know what you're doing.
*  Tradition of things they were doing.
*  So.
*  And you're out there making bear barbecue.
*  Yeah.
*  You're going to bring the ghosts.
*  That's how big was the bear.
*  It was a brown bear, big old brown bear.
*  I mean, it wasn't an old one.
*  It was probably it's hard to say, but it was a full grown.
*  Yeah.
*  Somewhere I put up a picture of the hide.
*  But anyway, yeah, yeah, it was a big bear.
*  I don't I don't actually know what I did with that video, which is very sad, but.
*  So you guys, you ate the moose, you ate the heart of the bear.
*  And how do they do that?
*  They just slice that up.
*  Yeah, just sliced it up, fried it up.
*  And then, yeah, there's a lot of bear stories out there.
*  You're constantly.
*  I can only imagine.
*  Constantly interacting with them when you're always in the woods like that.
*  Well, unhappy people, the guy was talking about losing his favorite hunting dog.
*  Yeah, yeah, that happens.
*  The way they do dogs over there, they think you're interesting
*  because they have a different dog for every type of animal.
*  So if you got like a dog that's really good at treing birds
*  and you got a dog that's good at going after bears
*  and you got a dog that's good at sable, you know, like
*  you just keep raising dogs until you get one that likes to go after what you need it to go for.
*  Where are they getting their dogs from?
*  It's just like this a Venky breed of dog.
*  I don't know, just random.
*  What do they look like?
*  Just like either white, mutts.
*  Yeah, mutt looking things.
*  They're not very big, but they're not small.
*  There's average, coyote size dogs and they.
*  Yeah, usually white or red or spotted.
*  And what do they feed them?
*  Just mush like this, like oat mush stuff they buy in the village.
*  Not very good food, but then the dogs like
*  fend try to fend for themselves and stuff.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Catch mice and things like that.
*  It's like they're like not an envy.
*  Well, the dogs seem pretty happy, but they also like, you know, you go out in super cold weather
*  and this dog will have melted a big hole in the snow and it gets snowed on top of it
*  and it like pops up out of this hole.
*  That's how they're sleeping?
*  Yeah, they just sleep outside.
*  They're tough dogs.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And they're eating just mush?
*  Yeah, they're just eating mush and like certain scraps and stuff.
*  But yeah, not an enviable diet they have.
*  They're usually kind of thin, but.
*  But they don't know any better.
*  Yeah, they don't know any better.
*  They like it.
*  They seem happy running around free like that.
*  What incredible animal dogs are.
*  Yeah, super cool.
*  It's just so what a strain.
*  What is this?
*  Oh, there's one.
*  That's Petia.
*  That's he's such a cool guy.
*  But that's him and his reindeer.
*  If I saw like if I didn't know any better, I saw a dude with a reindeer with a saddle.
*  I might get the fuck out of here.
*  That's not real.
*  You can't just ride a reindeer around because the reindeer is not that big.
*  That looks like about a 200 pound reindeer.
*  Yeah, they're not, but they're pretty strong.
*  They're like they'll pull you in like, but it is border like a guy like me or whatever.
*  It's starting to get borderline.
*  But how much do you weigh?
*  Like 175.
*  And so if you're on a 200 pound.
*  You just got to get a stronger one.
*  Yeah.
*  And there's they do it.
*  The strongest ones will carry well over 200 pound person.
*  How big are the big ones?
*  Big.
*  I don't know the weight, but you.
*  Like a 300 pound.
*  No, I don't think caribou is really big.
*  Yeah.
*  Not the domestic ones are probably a little smaller.
*  And I don't think they get that heavy, maybe 250.
*  But the but they're strong, man.
*  You like get on like there's be some cool times where you're just out in the middle
*  of this field in Siberia.
*  You know, you know, those swamps have that like tough to grass.
*  That's like you walk on and then, you know, you're carrying your reindeer along.
*  He's like in tow maybe.
*  And then you get to this big flowing river with ice and everything and jump on your
*  reindeer and just hope he can make it through without stumbling.
*  And you're like on the back of this reindeer like feels life or death if you fall in this
*  river, you know, and you just hang on to him and trust that he won't stumble, you know,
*  and make it across this river, pull up on the other shore.
*  And you're just like, oh, do you ever have dreams of that life?
*  Like after you've done it, like do you ever?
*  It's always present with me.
*  You know, like I always think about it.
*  Like I was saying, it's like it's interesting to live in a modern world and see the things
*  that pull my suck my time and how in some way it's very unsatisfying, you know, the
*  Internet, the social media thing.
*  But it's so engrossing.
*  And I miss it.
*  And then those are the reasons why like always think, man, how could you how could you get
*  this, you know, a little more in our modern society or how, you know, that's what those
*  was like the initial catalyst for why I thought about.
*  I wonder if something like that would be able to be revived, you know.
*  Now, after you've had all these wild experiences, do you long for more?
*  Is it something like we go live a normal life for a while and you start getting the itch?
*  Yeah, definitely.
*  It's like, again, it's like that thing where it's like if it was my friends and family
*  living that life, I would just choose it.
*  But because it's not like it's hard to like feel fully committed into it because, you
*  know, you got your kids and all your wife and they're all over there and none of your
*  family can see them.
*  You know, it's such a different separate life.
*  That said, I do know that it's very satisfying, you know, on a deep level.
*  So it's kind of interesting to.
*  But I try to incorporate as many lessons as I can, you know, and like anything that keeps
*  you connected to, you know, how we were designed to be just started, you just connected to
*  the land, to nature.
*  I love all those things.
*  So what do you do now for a living?
*  Well, we're going to.
*  What I generally do for a living is renovate crappy houses and then flip them out usually.
*  But I'm going to start doing trying to do some survival schools, you know, in Idaho
*  in the wilderness.
*  Oh, OK.
*  People out there.
*  And then so maybe get connected to my friend, Dan Doty.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Who's he?
*  That's the guy we were talking about earlier.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That looked like I should.
*  I should get in touch with him.
*  And so you'll you'll do stuff like that.
*  But yeah, I did a class in Ontario this winter, you know, taught some folks just general
*  survival skills and stuff.
*  And what do you do that?
*  What do you how does that set up?
*  Do you give a lot of spend a week out in the week?
*  Yeah.
*  The classes we're going to have in July will just ride horses up into the wilderness in Idaho
*  and spend a week up there.
*  And a lot of it is teaching.
*  There's definitely hard skills, all the hard skills.
*  There's also a lot of just mental.
*  What's the mental framework that you need to have to survive and to be resilient and
*  stuff like that?
*  And that's a whole fascinating topic in and of itself.
*  You dig deep when you're out by yourself.
*  It's amazing how deep your thoughts go.
*  Now, when you say mental skills, what do you teach people in terms of mental skills?
*  How can you?
*  I would.
*  Well, like if someone was going to be prepared, wanted to prepare to go.
*  There's a few things that would be really helpful.
*  One, you need to practice gratitude, right?
*  It's like just being thankful for what you have, even in a rough situation is key, you
*  know, and that's that can come from having like perspective, you know, like reading.
*  If you read the Gulag Archipelago, you're saying it makes it hard to complain about
*  your particular situation.
*  And so having like perspective like that, I think is good.
*  So for me, it was good knowing my like family history.
*  You know, they're like Assyrians who got, you know, in the Armenian genocide kind of
*  got wiped out.
*  And so they have brutal stories of what happened to them.
*  It's like, oh, it puts all my suffering in perspective.
*  And I see that the people who lived through that came out joyful people somehow.
*  And, you know, and so resilient, resilient people.
*  Yeah, not only did they live, but they went on to have a family that was like my aunts
*  and uncles who were like really happy, beautiful people.
*  And so how do they get that resilience is something that I've thought a lot about.
*  And, you know, gratitude is a big deal.
*  You know, having experience that puts perspective on time, like knowing that your relationships
*  are strong.
*  So like having gone to Russia a bunch, you spend a year over there.
*  The first time you're like, oh, man, I miss everybody.
*  But then you realize when you come back, they're right there.
*  They still love you.
*  No.
*  So having strong relationships is very important.
*  You don't want to have a lot of skeletons in your closet.
*  You know, like if you get out there and you're alone in some survival situation.
*  You have to think about all the shit you've done.
*  It's amazing what you think of people that I long forgot about, you know, like,
*  and like people like, oh, I should call that guy and make it right with that guy.
*  But I think if you had a lot of issues that you had never dealt through,
*  you'd guarantee they're going to come up out there, you know, stuff that you forgot about.
*  And so that's like combing through and making sure you're just mentally everything's in order,
*  you know, like kind of knowing why you're doing what you're doing, you know, like, yeah, yeah.
*  So that's yeah, there's a lot there that you can kind of unpack.
*  So when you have this survival school that you're teaching,
*  do you have a specific curriculum? Do you write out?
*  No, basically, I've thought like, what is it that I've learned over the years that's allowed me
*  to do, you know, to be successful or to do to thrive in some of those situations?
*  And how can I impart that, you know, that's mainly I'm just trying to show people
*  and what I've learned and what's practical in the woods, because it's easy to get a lot of skills
*  that you're not really going to use or whatever. But I think if you know what, you know,
*  I've experienced what people in the wilderness really do to live and like having those skills,
*  hopefully being able to impart the mental and also physical skills to thrive. I don't know,
*  I just think that's yeah, and some of its experience. So somebody just going out in the woods,
*  a lot of people haven't spent a week in the woods, just going out there and seeing what it's all like,
*  what it's like to scout out a new place and be like, okay, where am I going to build my shelter?
*  How am I going to get food? You know, like all that stuff.
*  When you have those people come out for a survival school, what do they bring with them?
*  And what do you? Well, it depends. I mean, I haven't done a lot of these. This is
*  my first ones in Idaho are going to be in July. The one I did in Ontario, we basically told them
*  to bring act like they were on that show, you know, bring 10 items and we'll make the best of
*  it, you know, and then and so that's how many people are there at a time work up there. I think
*  it was six and in Idaho is if it's still, you know, if COVID still a thing and there's a limit of 10
*  people, then I guess it'll bring eight and it'll be me and my brother who and we'll teach them what
*  we know. How do you vet those people? Like, how do you make sure they're not completely out of
*  their fucking mind? Trapped in the wilderness with someone you don't want to go to sleep next to
*  learn a whole new set of survival skills? Imagine if someone was a real psycho,
*  really social. Yeah, that'd be a way they'd want to express themselves
*  alone in the forest with a bunch of people trying to survive.
*  Hopefully we can keep that in check. Yeah, do you ask about their background? Do you do a background
*  check on them? Not really. No, it's just let it ride. Let it ride. She wants to put themselves
*  in that situation. It's all right. It'll be cool. I've dealt with a lot of people, so I think it's
*  okay. Yeah. In general, what are the type of people that want to learn this kind of stuff?
*  Oh, I think it can be broad. It's not too extreme. It's not like I'm looking for people that
*  you don't have to be super hardcore. It's just people that want to have a new experience broad
*  in their horizons. It's kind of like choose your own adventure. You don't have to go out there and
*  starve for a week. Yeah, just come out. I'll be there with you to teach you things and we'll
*  make the best of the week and see what we can learn. And I don't know, whoever. It could be
*  anybody. Do you have a longing for personal adventure though? Is it a thing outside of just
*  teaching this? Yeah. Oh yeah. One of the things I want to do now, I feel like I got a little more
*  freedom because I just spend more time in the mountains. I love it. It speaks to me. So I'm
*  going to try to do that. I want to also stay connected with the Evanque over there. When the
*  borders open back up, I want to go back with my family. We've tried restoring some reindeer
*  herds to people who have lost their reindeer and want to go over and kind of check on that project,
*  see how they're progressing, see if they are. And it's like that type of thing. If I see that
*  people are making progress and building their herd back or making some kind of progress,
*  then I'll try to support them more and feed into that. So there's things that I want to remain
*  connected to. We'll see. I'm also really interested in like, I like all those
*  restoring types. When I hear about restoring elk to the out east or restoring buffalo herds,
*  all that kind of stuff to me is pretty exciting. So we'll just see. I don't know. We'll see where it all goes.
*  Yeah. Listen. Take it a day at a time. Well dude, I really appreciate you being here. You've lived a really
*  fascinating life. That's fine. I appreciate you having me on. It's cool to connect with you and
*  be able to do this. Yeah. I really enjoyed it. Come on up to Idaho sometime when you're
*  bored or out to Virginia. All right, man. I'm not going to Siberia, so that's about as far as you get.
*  Thanks, brother. I appreciate you, man. Thanks for being here. It's been good. All right. Bye, everybody.
