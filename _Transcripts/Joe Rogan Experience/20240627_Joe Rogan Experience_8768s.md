# Joe Rogan Experience #2032 - BJ Penn & Tulsi Gabbard
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5.8s)]
*  Yeah, we're doing a fight companion Saturday night. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=9.6s)]
*  The fight companion is fun. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=14.68s)]
*  It is. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=16.16s)]
*  Have a little whiskey, watch the fights, talk a little shit. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=17.16s)]
*  Eddie Bravo brings up some crazy conspiracies. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=20.68s)]
*  Every time. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=23.32s)]
*  This time Eddie's out, so Sam Tripoli's in. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=24.44s)]
*  He's even more deep into the world of conspiracy. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=26.8s)]
*  And he's hilarious. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=30.8s)]
*  But conspiracy theory is the code name for spoiler alert. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=32.6s)]
*  Well, it was invented. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=37.4s)]
*  The term conspiracy theories was invented after they conspired to kill the president. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=40.68s)]
*  That's when conspiracy theory, the term conspiracy theory started getting thrown around right [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=45.6s)]
*  the time that Kennedy got assassinated. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=54.84s)]
*  And it was directly because there were so many people that had all these theories. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=57.440000000000005s)]
*  There was all these stories, stories about the shots from the grassy knoll. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=61.56s)]
*  And until Dick Gregory went on the Geraldo Rivera show, which I think was 11 years later. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=65.72s)]
*  What year was it that Dick Gregory went on Geraldo Rivera and showed the Zapruder footage? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=75.12s)]
*  Many years later, at least eight years later. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=82.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=84.44s)]
*  After the assassination. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=85.44s)]
*  What, the Zapruder film came late, right? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=86.44s)]
*  But it was a different assassination attempt. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=88.4s)]
*  Oh, it was another assassination attempt. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=91.28s)]
*  Garfield. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=93.44s)]
*  Garfield. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=94.44s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=95.44s)]
*  In 1881. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=96.44s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=97.44s)]
*  Oh, conspiracy theorists. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=98.44s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=101.44s)]
*  When did the Zapruder film come out? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=103.44s)]
*  So they had the Zapruder film. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=105.6s)]
*  I think his name was Abraham Zapruder. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=108.08s)]
*  He was at the scene and he was filming the president as he was driving down. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=111.1s)]
*  And as he was driving down, he caught the shots. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=117.61999999999999s)]
*  He caught the shot to the neck and he sees Kennedy holding his neck and then he sees [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=120.17999999999999s)]
*  the head go back and to the left. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=124.41999999999999s)]
*  So 1975. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=126.33999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=127.34s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=128.34s)]
*  The assassination was 63. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=129.57999999999998s)]
*  So 75. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=132.5s)]
*  What was in 63? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=133.5s)]
*  What was in 63? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=135.45999999999998s)]
*  63, Kennedy was assassinated. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=136.45999999999998s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=137.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=138.45999999999998s)]
*  But the Zapruder film was released by Dick Gregor, who is a stand-up comedian. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=139.82000000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=144.3s)]
*  Dick Gregory brought it to the Geraldo Rivera show with this other gentleman and then they [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=145.3s)]
*  played it for America. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=150.06s)]
*  And the whole country got to see Kennedy's head go back and to the left and this spray [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=152.18s)]
*  of blood. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=157.02s)]
*  And everybody's like, wait. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=158.18s)]
*  What? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=160.06s)]
*  What happened? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=161.06s)]
*  Did they ever say why it took so long? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=162.06s)]
*  Because it's fake. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=164.98000000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=165.98000000000002s)]
*  Because it was owned. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=166.98000000000002s)]
*  Something's going on. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=167.98000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=169.5s)]
*  Life. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=170.5s)]
*  So I believe what happened was Zapruder sold it to life. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=171.5s)]
*  Life had it and they wouldn't release it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=176.38s)]
*  So they either they thought it was too disturbing or maybe they were told not to. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=178.7s)]
*  We also have to remember that back then there was no VCRs. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=184.29999999999998s)]
*  It's very hard to watch something like this. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=187.7s)]
*  You'd have to have one of those reel to reel cameras that you could set up and watch. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=189.5s)]
*  I mean, nobody watched films at home. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=195.06s)]
*  You watch what was on television. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=197.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=198.5s)]
*  So when they played that, this was monumental. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=199.5s)]
*  This is not so. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=203.18s)]
*  And then you had to be there to see it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=204.18s)]
*  You couldn't just pause it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=206.22s)]
*  You couldn't rewind it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=207.9s)]
*  There was none of that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=208.9s)]
*  There's no DVR. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=209.9s)]
*  And you couldn't tell your friends on social media. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=211.38s)]
*  You had to like go to work the next day and go, did you see that Geraldo Rivera show? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=213.78s)]
*  But just by the way, I think it was on late at night too. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=217.78s)]
*  I think it actually says good morning or good night. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=220.70000000000002s)]
*  I think it's on late. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=224.70000000000002s)]
*  I think it's on late. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=225.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, good night. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=226.7s)]
*  I think it was a late night show. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=227.7s)]
*  Is that what blew Geraldo up? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=228.7s)]
*  No, he was already doing well. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=231.7s)]
*  He was already an established journalist, which is why he was the host of that show. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=235.01999999999998s)]
*  And I think it was late at night. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=238.89999999999998s)]
*  So fucking nobody was watching. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=241.33999999999997s)]
*  You know, like a small amount of people watching. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=242.94s)]
*  And then, you know, they play this, they see it once, they go, what the fuck did I just [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=245.06s)]
*  see? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=248.66s)]
*  And then it takes forever for books to come out. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=249.66s)]
*  And now we got Tucker Carlson on Fox News saying the CIA killed Kennedy. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=253.02s)]
*  And you're like, what did he just say? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=258.22s)]
*  What? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=260.22s)]
*  Did he just say that on TV? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=261.22s)]
*  Like what? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=263.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=264.42s)]
*  Imagine how long it took for somebody to find out who the president was before the telegraph [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=265.42s)]
*  type thing. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=271.86s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=272.86s)]
*  Two years. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=273.86s)]
*  Now imagine those elections. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=274.86s)]
*  Oh my God, right. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=277.94s)]
*  The checks and balances. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=278.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=279.94s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=280.94s)]
*  Imagine if you found out that Washington stole the election. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=282.86s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=286.78s)]
*  It is funny. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=287.78s)]
*  It is funny. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=288.78s)]
*  What if we found out Lincoln was a total fraud? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=289.78s)]
*  Thomas Jefferson, right? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=291.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=292.78s)]
*  They all stole the election. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=293.78s)]
*  Like what? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=294.78s)]
*  Had people assassinated and voted incorrectly. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=295.78s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=299.58s)]
*  But Lincoln ran and lost like five times or something, right? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=300.58s)]
*  Before he won. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=303.58s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=304.58s)]
*  I don't remember if it was for president or when he ran for a different office, but. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=305.58s)]
*  Back then they would stand in front of the whole town, like on a literal soap box, and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=309.42s)]
*  talk for hours. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=314.22s)]
*  Hours and hours in front of everybody explaining what they were going to do. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=316.38s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=320.42s)]
*  So you've got to imagine that when this Pruder film came out, that was a moment where like [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=321.62s)]
*  errr, you've got to also realize this is like during the time of the Vietnam War. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=327.78000000000003s)]
*  So there's already massive distrust in government and people are like, you know, what happened [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=333.06s)]
*  exactly? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=338.5s)]
*  And then the books start coming out. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=339.5s)]
*  You know, books start coming out like Best Evidence by David Lifton. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=341.62s)]
*  Twelve years later. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=344.7s)]
*  Twelve years and nobody but the CIA saw it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=345.7s)]
*  I'm sure. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=349.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=350.5s)]
*  It wasn't until Dick Gregory, a stand-up comedian, brings it to the Geraldo Rivera [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=351.5s)]
*  show. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=359.41999999999996s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=360.41999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=361.41999999999996s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=362.41999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it's incredible. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=363.41999999999996s)]
*  I thought it was two years it came out, two years late, but wow, twelve years. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=364.41999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, so seventy five. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=368.09999999999997s)]
*  So you know, just imagine something that happened twelve years ago for us. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=370.17999999999995s)]
*  Like what? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=375.53999999999996s)]
*  Two thousand and eleven? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=376.53999999999996s)]
*  Which by the way, that sounds crazy. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=377.53999999999996s)]
*  It does. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=379.38s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=380.38s)]
*  That is crazy. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=381.38s)]
*  What the fuck is happening? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=382.38s)]
*  Time is flying. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=383.38s)]
*  Too fast. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=385.14s)]
*  And what a world we live in now where even if the government tried to withhold information [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=386.14s)]
*  or tries to as they do with social media and all these different platforms, it's very, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=392.94s)]
*  very hard. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=400.22s)]
*  It's very, very hard. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=401.22s)]
*  So they try to push a narrative and then different people have questions and you know, it creates [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=402.66s)]
*  this environment where if the truth is not being told, people can pick up on it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=407.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=414.18s)]
*  I was surprised he got in because Victorino was so loyal, kept the pandemic on. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=415.5s)]
*  He even did that where you got to reset your vaccination status or whatever. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=424.94s)]
*  But when I saw Bisson and he's so smart, I mean, they're talking, they're like, what [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=429.38s)]
*  about social media? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=433.7s)]
*  He just being a judge writer, he just looks over and says, I don't got time for that stuff [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=434.7s)]
*  and looks for it. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=439.74s)]
*  You know, it just, they're really smart speakers and they know what they're doing out there, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=441.3s)]
*  right? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=447.18s)]
*  The people in office, you know? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=448.18s)]
*  Well, I mean, Tulsi can speak to that better than anybody. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=449.78000000000003s)]
*  I don't know Mayor Bisson. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=453.18s)]
*  I may have met him in passing, but this has been one of the big failures around the aftermath [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=455.06s)]
*  of the wildfire on Maui is this total vacuum of information from government officials to [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=462.34000000000003s)]
*  the people. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=469.82s)]
*  And in that vacuum, obviously people have all kinds of ideas or theories or this or [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=471.38s)]
*  that, but people were left without any kind of communication from anyone in a position [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=475.82s)]
*  of authority to provide help for days and weeks. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=480.26s)]
*  And it created massive problems. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=484.85999999999996s)]
*  And so, you know, the immediate line of response needed to come from the county and from the [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=486.73999999999995s)]
*  mayor and from their emergency response director. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=493.38s)]
*  And unfortunately, they did not communicate. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=496.76s)]
*  They're still not communicating. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=500.22s)]
*  There's still a huge lack of transparency and therefore an increasing level of distrust [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=501.34s)]
*  in any of the levels of government that should be bending over backwards to answer questions [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=508.26s)]
*  and to say, hey, here's what's going on every single day. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=513.62s)]
*  Here's what we're doing. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=517.04s)]
*  Here's what we're trying to do. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=518.04s)]
*  Here's what we're having a hard time doing. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=519.04s)]
*  Whatever the case may be, it has just, it's been a major problem from the beginning. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=520.04s)]
*  Do you think that this is a complete lack, because of a complete lack of preparedness, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=526.18s)]
*  that this is an unprecedented type of disaster, never happened before, it happens and they [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=531.06s)]
*  just weren't prepared. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=535.9s)]
*  They don't know what to do and they just, it's incompetence? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=536.9799999999999s)]
*  I think that that is very true. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=540.42s)]
*  And there's, you know, in hindsight, there are things going back as, you know, Maui has [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=543.8199999999999s)]
*  experienced drought year after year after year. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=547.9s)]
*  Brushfires are a common occurrence, especially on the west side of Maui, where Lahaina is. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=551.06s)]
*  It's the side of the island that was most impacted by this. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=556.1s)]
*  You know, it is, you know, being prepared for wildfires on Maui is something that if [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=561.02s)]
*  you look at their, you know, emergency assessment documents, it's mentioned almost as a bit [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=566.3000000000001s)]
*  of an afterthought. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=572.34s)]
*  Maui fire has been vastly undermanned and under-resourced for quite some time. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=573.9s)]
*  So there's all these different things you can look at from a preparedness level that [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=578.9s)]
*  should have been addressed long before. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=582.42s)]
*  But from, you know, the county officials, yes, they were completely overwhelmed and [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=584.9s)]
*  unprepared for this unprecedented wildfire. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=593.9799999999999s)]
*  It's the worst wildfire our country has seen in over a hundred years. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=597.9s)]
*  But the problem is, once you get to that point, like, oh, shit, this is really, really, really [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=602.38s)]
*  bad, not only in the hundreds of lives lost in that fire, but the surrounding communities [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=608.54s)]
*  of people who survived, but who went without power, who went without any cell phone signal, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=615.0999999999999s)]
*  any ability to communicate with people, who didn't have, you know, all of the gas stations [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=622.54s)]
*  in their neighborhood, they were empty. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=625.6999999999999s)]
*  There was no way to get gas. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=627.6999999999999s)]
*  They couldn't get food. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=629.24s)]
*  They couldn't get clean water. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=630.24s)]
*  The water supply systems were contaminated. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=631.8s)]
*  There was disaster upon disaster that came in the aftermath of the fire that went unaddressed. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=635.6600000000001s)]
*  And my biggest, I went there a few days after the fire happened. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=641.4200000000001s)]
*  Maui was my district for eight years when I served in Congress and had a lot of friends [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=646.74s)]
*  there and went out to those affected communities. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=651.22s)]
*  And what I heard over and over again was no one from the county, the state, or the federal [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=654.6600000000001s)]
*  government has shown their face in our community. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=659.22s)]
*  It is neighbors helping neighbors, families helping families, people on the island of [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=663.16s)]
*  Molokai, which you know, they don't have much on their island. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=667.92s)]
*  Everything comes in by barge. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=673.26s)]
*  They're loading up whatever they have in their general store on these little boats and running [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=674.4s)]
*  them over to West Maui on a private boat dock, because that was the only place that they [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=679.32s)]
*  wouldn't be blocked from bringing food and water and medical supplies. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=683.68s)]
*  Now, why are people being blocked? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=687.8s)]
*  I keep hearing that about people being blocked. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=689.92s)]
*  Is it because they haven't gotten an accurate death count? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=692.04s)]
*  Is it because they have to make an assessment of how much was damaged? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=694.64s)]
*  And it's so massive, it's so vast that they haven't been able to do that yet? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=698.4399999999999s)]
*  Like, why is it being blocked? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=702.3199999999999s)]
*  Things are things. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=703.8s)]
*  So things are being opened up now. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=704.8s)]
*  I think people are able to get in and out of the West Maui area. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=706.36s)]
*  I understand that the historic town of Lahaina is still being blocked off and they're working [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=709.48s)]
*  on reopening it as we speak. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=716.24s)]
*  But in the couple of weeks after the fire, I don't have a good answer. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=720.4s)]
*  Why they continue to block the roads, again, to those surrounding communities. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=726.0799999999999s)]
*  Why they blocked people like Kai Lenny and others from using their jet skis and boats [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=731.8399999999999s)]
*  to try to bring supplies in through the water. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=737.3199999999999s)]
*  You could say, well, we were trying to secure the area, but you're blocking. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=741.92s)]
*  You're blocking friends and family from coming in and bringing necessary supplies, literally [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=747.2s)]
*  doing supply runs. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=752.1600000000001s)]
*  So I jumped on a plane that was doing supply runs from Kahului, the main airport on Maui, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=753.24s)]
*  out to this tiny little airport that serves that community. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=761.2s)]
*  And that was for a lot of days the only way that they could get supplies brought in. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=766.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=770.5s)]
*  I really don't know. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=771.5s)]
*  But again, this goes back to why aren't you communicating to people what's going on and [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=772.76s)]
*  why you're doing what you're doing? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=777.9s)]
*  The result of their decisions left people and families and communities stranded in their [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=780.28s)]
*  most dire time of need. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=785.74s)]
*  And the mayor didn't go out and show his face until almost two weeks after the fire happened. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=788.7s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=792.92s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=793.92s)]
*  And then he wants to take the land for the state. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=794.92s)]
*  That's his first word. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=797.72s)]
*  Now this is one of the reasons why we want to talk about this. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=798.72s)]
*  How is that possible that these people could lose their home and then lose their land? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=802.54s)]
*  How is that possible? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=807.8199999999999s)]
*  It is the number one concern of people there in Lahaina is that a few days after this happened, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=809.4599999999999s)]
*  I haven't spoken to the governor, but he said in a press conference, he said, we're talking [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=817.06s)]
*  to the attorney general. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=821.86s)]
*  He said, I'm talking to my attorney general to explore options for the state to take over [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=822.86s)]
*  that land and use it to build workforce housing or build a memorial to the lot for the people [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=827.9s)]
*  who lost their lives. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=833.18s)]
*  But the fears that the people in Lahaina have, some of whom like Archie Kaleepa, famous surfer [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=835.02s)]
*  community leader, native Hawaiian leaders, family has lived in Lahaina for nine generations. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=840.26s)]
*  Now being told, well, the state, the governor is looking at taking that land, taking ownership [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=845.98s)]
*  of that land. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=852.04s)]
*  It is unconscionable. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=855.86s)]
*  And there's, oh, you know, we'll, you know, for those who've been displaced, we'll see [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=857.74s)]
*  about doing a land swap and we'll send you to the big island to live in Puna. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=860.94s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=864.78s)]
*  It's taking away the sovereignty of people's rights to have a say over their home. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=865.78s)]
*  In many cases, their generational lands is, it is such an abuse of power. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=871.46s)]
*  And so this is, and I'm glad that there are leaders in the community who are leaning into [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=878.58s)]
*  this fight to make sure that they are fighting this fight before anybody tries to do that, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=884.22s)]
*  rather than looking in the rear view mirror and saying, gosh, I wish we had done something. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=890.34s)]
*  But just imagine a governor going on television after a massive tragedy where you have, we [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=894.5s)]
*  don't even know the number of people dead yet. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=903.4200000000001s)]
*  You have this massive area that's been burnt to the ground. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=905.58s)]
*  And then he starts talking about taking it over for the state. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=908.82s)]
*  That's an insane position to take. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=911.86s)]
*  Post tragedy. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=914.5s)]
*  When people are suffering at their most, they can't even believe it happened. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=915.5s)]
*  And then all of a sudden he's saying, we're going to take it for the state and make a [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=919.22s)]
*  memorial. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=922.54s)]
*  How about give the fucking people their homes back? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=923.54s)]
*  One of the things we went over yesterday, which is a crazy number, we were looking at [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=926.94s)]
*  the amount of money that was accidentally sent to Ukraine. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=931.34s)]
*  Like they, they, they over sent 6 billion. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=934.82s)]
*  And then I said, well, how much would it cost to rebuild every house in the Maui fire? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=938.3000000000001s)]
*  And it's 5 billion, 5 billion something. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=942.58s)]
*  Like they, that's just like accidental money. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=945.4200000000001s)]
*  But there's no talk of doing that. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=948.62s)]
*  There's no talk of doing that. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=950.26s)]
*  Is that interesting? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=951.86s)]
*  The way, the way, and it has, it's happened two or three times now where the Pentagon [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=952.86s)]
*  has said, oh, we miscalculated how much money we had set aside for Ukraine. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=956.0200000000001s)]
*  So we have an extra 4 billion to send now that we didn't know we had. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=961.58s)]
*  And this has happened a few times. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=965.74s)]
*  Secretary of State Tony Blinken went to Kiev yesterday promising, hey, we're going to [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=968.1400000000001s)]
*  give you another billion now. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=972.54s)]
*  And this is the thing when I was out there in Maui, person after person was like Tulsi, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=974.3s)]
*  tell me what would happen if we started to call ourselves Ukraine. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=981.0999999999999s)]
*  You think they would give us some money then to take care of our families, to put, to fix [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=985.18s)]
*  our roofs, you know, that, that have been torn up by the hurricane winds that came through [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=989.62s)]
*  to make sure we have clean water to drink. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=994.02s)]
*  You think they might pay attention to us then? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=996.18s)]
*  And then the, and then FEMA comes out, the FEMA director comes out and does this press [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=998.74s)]
*  conference. I think it was at the White House. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1002.0600000000001s)]
*  And she says, someone said, well, what are you doing for Maui? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1004.3000000000001s)]
*  She's like, oh, we're giving a one time seven hundred dollar payment to everybody who's [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1007.62s)]
*  been impacted by the wildfire. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1013.14s)]
*  A one time seven hundred dollar payment. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1014.94s)]
*  It's insane. Hawaii has the highest cost of living in the entire country, the entire [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1017.54s)]
*  country. And how fricking insulting is it to have the rep, the lead disaster response [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1022.74s)]
*  administrator from the Biden administration stand there and proudly say, hey, we're giving [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1028.42s)]
*  everybody one seven hundred dollar payment. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1032.94s)]
*  It's insane. And it's insane, especially because of how much money we're sending to Ukraine. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1037.54s)]
*  Yeah. Because there's there can be no doubt that these things are financially motivated [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1043.54s)]
*  now. Someone is making money off the Ukraine thing. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1049.3000000000002s)]
*  And there's a reason why they're sending so much money. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1052.98s)]
*  Yes. They have so much concern. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1054.9s)]
*  Have we ever seen a real war? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1056.98s)]
*  I mean, when it first started, Putin came with a mile of tanks. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1059.1s)]
*  You would think the guy would be hanging in five days. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1063.82s)]
*  You know what? Their president, like when they went into Iraq and Saddam and they got [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1067.62s)]
*  Saddam, you know, and they hung him in front of the world. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1072.26s)]
*  You would think that Russia would be able to do that. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1074.82s)]
*  Well, Ukraine is very well armed now. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1077.74s)]
*  You know, we sent them a lot of really good stuff, but they're losing a lot of soldiers. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1080.54s)]
*  And the other the other thing about when they invaded was it was at a time where the [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1085.18s)]
*  grounds were like essentially like marshy, like they were they were concerned when it [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1089.5800000000002s)]
*  got colder because then the trucks and the tanks could roll in on the dirt. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1095.42s)]
*  But they were only coming in on the roads and the Ukrainians were ambushing them on [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1099.42s)]
*  the roads. Well, you hear that Russia is a superpower. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1103.78s)]
*  I mean, on par with the United States. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1107.3400000000001s)]
*  Well, they are. Heard that they are. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1109.46s)]
*  But they're just not they're not using the full force of their might. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1110.8200000000002s)]
*  I think we've spent more in Ukraine than Russia has. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1114.18s)]
*  Wow. That's crazy. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1117.9s)]
*  Find out if that's true. I think that one of the other things was that was our [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1120.06s)]
*  intelligence, the United States intelligence agencies in the lead up as Russia was [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1123.78s)]
*  building up their, you know, manning and tanks and everything at the border. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1128.5800000000002s)]
*  Our intelligence agencies were telling the president, telling the public that, you [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1133.6200000000001s)]
*  know, hey, what would they say? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1137.14s)]
*  They will take Kiev in days, like in a few days that Russia will take the capital of [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1139.18s)]
*  Ukraine. But even their intelligence proved to be vastly wrong. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1144.7s)]
*  Very, very wrong. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1151.9s)]
*  And this is why, you know, people people use this fear tactic to justify sending all [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1153.3400000000001s)]
*  of these hundreds of billions of dollars to Ukraine say, well, if we don't do this, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1159.22s)]
*  Russia is going to take all of Ukraine and then take over all of Europe. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1163.5800000000002s)]
*  Like, no, they don't have that capability. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1166.7399999999998s)]
*  You're fear mongering in order to continue to fund a war that's benefiting the [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1170.54s)]
*  military industrial complex more than anyone else. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1175.1s)]
*  There you go. That's what it looks like. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1177.9799999999998s)]
*  Just another another one of those 20 year wars is going to be 20 years. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1179.26s)]
*  You know, real similar to what we just got out of. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1183.1799999999998s)]
*  And if you're looking at that in relation to like what's going on in in Hawaii, it [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1185.86s)]
*  shows what's wrong with the world and shows its wrong priorities. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1191.9799999999998s)]
*  Frankly, it is it is when you look at, you know, President Biden and his people [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1196.0600000000002s)]
*  announce like, oh, hey, look, he's going to take a break from his vacation at Lake [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1202.66s)]
*  Tahoe to go and visit the people. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1207.0600000000002s)]
*  What a good guy. Exactly. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1208.7800000000002s)]
*  Did you see when he went there and he started talking about a fire that he had, he [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1210.0600000000002s)]
*  almost lost his car. Yeah. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1212.7s)]
*  Yeah. I know what a fire is like. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1213.94s)]
*  I almost lost my car once. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1215.5800000000002s)]
*  That is what it's like. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1217.26s)]
*  They do that on purpose. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1219.26s)]
*  They have him just babble something. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1220.46s)]
*  So you can't stop him. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1222.18s)]
*  He is the president. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1224.26s)]
*  They are a bunch of dopes who work for him. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1225.34s)]
*  Like the smartest one is probably that White House press secretary. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1227.46s)]
*  Like when that's your ace in the hole, you got you got a fucking entire [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1230.18s)]
*  administration like think about that one guy that got busted because he was [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1235.66s)]
*  stealing women's clothes at the airport. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1239.22s)]
*  You know, he's he's not buying our first non-binary person in the White House. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1241.46s)]
*  Fantastic. And this dude just stealing ladies clothes. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1245.94s)]
*  Like not one is not an accident. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1248.26s)]
*  Like you just that's his thing. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1250.46s)]
*  Steals people's bags, puts in their clothes, dresses up like that. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1251.8999999999999s)]
*  Brought their stuff to a hotel, threw out some of it, kept other ones. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1255.78s)]
*  I thought it was my bag. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1259.3s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1261.06s)]
*  Cooke's. Over and over. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1262.62s)]
*  And so there's no one running the show. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1264.6999999999998s)]
*  The show's chaos, you know, and then the people that are involved, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1266.58s)]
*  I'm sure in the defense industry, like, listen, it'd be very nice [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1270.4199999999998s)]
*  if we could continue this project. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1274.1s)]
*  Yeah. And continue funding. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1275.9399999999998s)]
*  I mean, watching Green and even watching Hilo's own mayor, Mitch Roth, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1278.06s)]

*  East Palestine. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1401.5s)]

*  That was not that long ago that these people are living in toxic soup. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1404.82s)]
*  Everybody's completely forgotten about it. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1408.3s)]
*  There's no stories on TV. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1410.4199999999998s)]
*  There's no stories in the newspaper. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1412.3s)]
*  What about that community of people that experienced an insane experience? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1414.26s)]
*  A train derails with toxic chemicals and they decide to light it all on fire. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1418.78s)]
*  And Fisher fucking floating in the rivers. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1423.62s)]
*  The skies are black. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1426.22s)]
*  So President Biden was asked about this the other day by a reporter who said, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1430.22s)]
*  Oh, good. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1434.6599999999999s)]
*  There you go. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1436.26s)]
*  We'll go to East Palestine. Oh, he will. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1436.86s)]
*  Jean-Pierre, that lady. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1438.86s)]
*  She's hilarious. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1440.6999999999998s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1442.4599999999998s)]
*  What the way he responded to the reporter who asked is this. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1443.22s)]
*  Oh, it's been 200 and however many days since the disaster in East Palestine. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1446.54s)]
*  You promised that you would go there. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1450.54s)]
*  You haven't gone yet. Why? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1453.7s)]
*  And the president basically said, well, I haven't had time. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1455.66s)]
*  Wow. When I when I went to East Palestine, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1459.9s)]
*  I got involved with politics in Hawaii in the first place because of water, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1464.26s)]
*  protecting the environment, making sure we have clean water. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1470.06s)]
*  And so the challenges people on Maui are facing with water, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1472.8600000000001s)]
*  the challenges people in East Palestine are facing. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1476.1s)]
*  It was such a huge toxic disaster. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1478.06s)]
*  But when I was there, they were saying [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1480.58s)]
*  that the effects of this disaster won't fully be known for a while [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1483.62s)]
*  because the toxins at that time hadn't had they were being told the water is clean. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1486.94s)]
*  It's fine. It's safe. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1490.8999999999999s)]
*  And the days after the disaster in East Palestine, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1492.06s)]
*  people there are smart enough to know, well, the water hasn't seeped down [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1494.66s)]
*  through the soil and into our groundwater sources [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1498.7s)]
*  for those tests to be accurate. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1503.26s)]
*  And so they were concerned not only about, well, how are you going to come back [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1505.62s)]
*  and test our water in a month, in two months, in six months, in a year? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1509.02s)]
*  How is that? It's a farming community out there. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1513.34s)]
*  How is that going to affect the crops? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1515.7s)]
*  They were already seeing animals dying in the weeks after that disaster happened. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1518.02s)]
*  And that was their foremost concern is nobody ever heard the name [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1523.18s)]
*  East Palestine before this disaster happened. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1526.3799999999999s)]
*  Will they still remember us when we need them? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1529.1399999999999s)]
*  And what about what's happening with their lungs? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1532.4199999999998s)]
*  Right. Those people breathing that air and they were told it was safe to go back. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1534.8999999999999s)]
*  And they were taking photos of the sky. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1539.58s)]
*  And when it rains, that stuff stays in the clouds. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1542.02s)]
*  And then when it rains, more comes down. Acid rain. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1545.18s)]
*  And then, you know, where's their money? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1550.78s)]
*  When they're accidentally sending an extra six billion to Ukraine. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1552.86s)]
*  What what does it doesn't make any sense? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1556.34s)]
*  It's just blatant and in your face that there's no concern about you. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1559.3799999999999s)]
*  The concern is about, you know, whatever the agenda is. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1564.3s)]
*  That's the concern. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1568.18s)]
*  And if the American people want the guy to go there and give a little speech [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1569.1s)]
*  and talk about I was almost on fire once, they'll go do it. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1573.26s)]
*  That's it. That's all you get. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1576.86s)]
*  And you get 700 bucks each. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1578.22s)]
*  And you get Ukraine gets an extra six billion. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1580.18s)]
*  This is an extra six billion. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1583.5s)]
*  What's the amount of money they spent so far in Ukraine? [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1585.7s)]
*  Let's guess. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1590.5s)]
*  Tells you it's well, well over 100 billion dollars. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1591.82s)]
*  They divvy it up. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1597.18s)]
*  When you look at the count, sometimes they will. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1598.46s)]
*  It's this much has gone towards weapons. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1600.02s)]
*  But like, you know, like, you know, the money we are giving to you [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1602.46s)]
*  that our government is giving to Ukraine is not only going to weapons. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1606.62s)]
*  We are paying. We taxpayers are paying for their bureaucracy. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1610.02s)]
*  We are paying for their administrators. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1613.5s)]
*  We are paying to 135, 135 billion. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1615.1399999999999s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1619.54s)]
*  So President just asked Congress 24. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1621.26s)]
*  Now, is that August 15th? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1624.58s)]
*  When was the fire? August 8th. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1626.26s)]
*  So this is after the fire. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1629.86s)]
*  He's asking Congress for 24 billion dollars for the war in Ukraine [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1632.1399999999999s)]
*  and zero dollars for Maui and 10 percent for the big guy. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1635.98s)]
*  You'd have to think you'd have to think that. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1640.78s)]
*  That's why it's easier to track the money when you bring it to Hawaii [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1642.82s)]
*  because all of our eyes are on the ball. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1646.42s)]
*  He can be corrupt anymore. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1648.98s)]
*  I mean, I think he's just living. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1650.3400000000001s)]
*  He's just eating ice cream and just waiting for the ticker to stop. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1652.66s)]
*  But this is insanity. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1655.98s)]
*  This is like true insanity. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1657.54s)]
*  And this is like the opposite of what we thought. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1659.42s)]
*  The whole idea of electing people for office is that these people [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1662.9s)]
*  are going to care about us and do the right thing for the community [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1666.3s)]
*  because they're one of us. That's what we want. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1669.02s)]
*  That's what we want. When someone who's one of us. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1671.26s)]
*  Yeah. And when you see that, especially from these guys like Biden, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1673.22s)]
*  that are these career politicians, they're the opposite of one of us. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1677.06s)]
*  They've been in that system forever. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1681.46s)]
*  They play in that game forever. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1683.98s)]
*  You know, the excuse that that Pete Buttigieg was the guy [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1686.6599999999999s)]
*  that the Biden administration sent to East Palestine. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1689.82s)]
*  Of course, he showed up. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1693.22s)]
*  He announced he was going only when Trump announced that he was going. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1694.22s)]
*  He literally showed there the day after Trump. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1698.98s)]
*  Trump went and visited the people there. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1700.8999999999999s)]
*  But, you know, the excuse that he gave is a common excuse [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1702.3s)]
*  that's given by people in government when they don't show up for people is, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1705.66s)]
*  well, you know, I didn't want to get in the way of the response. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1708.94s)]
*  You know, I'm busy doing things in my office to try to help, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1715.14s)]
*  But my point is like, Joe, if a really good friend of yours [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1720.8200000000002s)]
*  or your child or someone in your family was hurt for whatever reason, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1725.5800000000002s)]
*  was in pain, was suffering, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1731.38s)]
*  even if you are not in a in a personal position to be able to alleviate [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1733.7s)]
*  that pain and suffering, what's the first thing you do? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1738.38s)]
*  You go to them. You show up. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1740.5s)]
*  And you say, I love you. I care about you. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1743.02s)]
*  I'm here for you. Tell me how I can help. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1745.6200000000001s)]
*  And this is what I heard from officials on Maui at every level. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1747.98s)]
*  If the government is like, well, how do how do we know what they need? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1752.3400000000001s)]
*  How do we how do we best help? How do we best support? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1756.54s)]
*  You will not know unless you show up and say, I am here for you. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1759.1000000000001s)]
*  Tell me what you need. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1763.98s)]
*  Tell me how we can support you. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1765.46s)]
*  And if the answer is, I don't know, you were there for them. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1766.66s)]
*  Yeah. And that's what matters. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1770.66s)]
*  That's like if you care, you know, one should have to tell you right to do this. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1772.38s)]
*  Right. Because it's how long did it take them? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1777.42s)]
*  How long did it take them to come down and finally? [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1779.9s)]
*  I mean, I heard I heard from people there that it was like day [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1782.5s)]
*  10 or 11 that the mayor showed up. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1785.1000000000001s)]
*  That's a long time. That's a long time. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1787.3400000000001s)]
*  Right. The mayor that you live there. Yeah. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1789.26s)]
*  It's a small island. Yeah. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1792.34s)]
*  It's an excuse. It is. It is inexcusable. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1794.06s)]
*  There's there's no. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1796.86s)]
*  He must have been panicking. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1798.22s)]
*  Well, you'd have to think. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1799.9s)]
*  I mean, you're the governor. You leave. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1800.94s)]
*  The first thing you're going to do, you know, a hurricane's coming. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1804.18s)]
*  Get your emergency team ready. Right. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1806.9s)]
*  Why wasn't the emergency team ready to go? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1809.42s)]
*  Well, you know, the county, the head of emergency response for Maui County [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1812.26s)]
*  was on Oahu at a FEMA conference when this happened. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1816.18s)]
*  Happy hour. You know, why? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1818.54s)]
*  Why didn't he? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1820.42s)]
*  Like we all know you can get on a plane within 30 minutes [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1821.46s)]
*  to fly from Honolulu to Kahului and be there within an hour, hour and a half. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1825.9s)]
*  He didn't show up there until the one or two days after. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1830.66s)]
*  And when the mayor was asked, Mr. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1833.9s)]
*  this was a couple of weeks after, a reporter said, who was [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1836.7s)]
*  who was directing the response? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1839.46s)]
*  Your emergency management guy was not there. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1841.1000000000001s)]
*  Who was the person making decisions in the hours after the wildfire? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1843.5s)]
*  The mayor said, I don't know. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1849.02s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1851.98s)]
*  And what about the guy signing sounding the alarm? [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1852.82s)]
*  Now he he he resigns. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1855.94s)]
*  Well, does that mean he's not going to be criminally charged for criminal negligence? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1858.42s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, you talk to a thousand people. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1862.1399999999999s)]
*  He the guy who was on Oahu when the when the fires happened, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1865.74s)]
*  he didn't show his face in public to the media or to the or to the community [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1869.74s)]
*  until eight or nine days after the gunfire. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1875.34s)]
*  The crisis, the guy who should have been talking to the media [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1879.02s)]
*  every single day in the hours and days after he didn't show his face in public [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1882.22s)]
*  until day eight or nine. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1886.02s)]
*  And that was when he said that he didn't regret sounding the alarm system, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1887.58s)]
*  which is a whole other like his response made no sense whatsoever. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1892.78s)]
*  And then he resigned the day after. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1896.34s)]
*  I don't. What is the controversy about the alarm system? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1898.18s)]
*  So that was the question was like Hawaii has a state of the art alarm system. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1900.82s)]
*  We are the most remote island chain in the world. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1904.58s)]
*  And as a result, natural disasters is kind of a part of life. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1907.06s)]
*  Tsunamis or hurricanes or made it big flooding or whatever the case may be. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1910.58s)]
*  The best we have the best. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1914.26s)]
*  There was they were not sounded because of these fires. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1916.8999999999999s)]
*  And that was the number one question. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1920.3s)]
*  Why wouldn't you sound the alarm system? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1921.54s)]
*  We had to wait until eight or nine days after when he came out [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1924.46s)]
*  to this press conference and he was asked, do you regret not sounding the alarms? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1927.46s)]
*  Because they weren't broken. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1932.7s)]
*  They worked. And he said, I don't regret it. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1933.8999999999999s)]
*  And the reason is because he says we have been trained as people. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1936.82s)]
*  When we hear the alarm, we believe that a tsunami is coming. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1941.6599999999999s)]
*  And we have been trained to know that if a tsunami is coming, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1946.02s)]
*  you head towards the hills, you head away from the ocean and towards the mountains. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1949.34s)]
*  That is such bullshit. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1954.4199999999998s)]
*  Somebody told them that line. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1955.7s)]
*  That's the best line you can come with. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1957.1s)]
*  BJ, you know this because we all get the alarms on our phones. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1958.78s)]
*  Yeah. So, hey, there was a there was an earthquake near Japan. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1962.06s)]
*  Yeah. Tsunami may come to Hawaii in three days or four days. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1965.62s)]
*  Be aware. And we got all of our geologists and all these people. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1969.9399999999998s)]
*  They're tracking this. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1973.5s)]
*  You we have like a tsunami doesn't pop up out of nowhere. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1974.62s)]
*  That's something that we have. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1978.26s)]
*  So if that alarm sounds and we haven't gotten that notice, there's something else. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1979.62s)]
*  And we would know like this. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1985.6599999999999s)]
*  There was smoke like people. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1987.2199999999998s)]
*  Couldn't they send an alarm to your phones and said there's a fire? Yes. Yes. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1989.3799999999999s)]
*  You know, I don't know if he was. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1995.0600000000002s)]
*  So what happened with the water? [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1996.8600000000001s)]
*  There was also some controversy about the water not being utilized. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=1998.6200000000001s)]
*  I think the power went down and then the water pumps went down from what I read. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2001.7800000000002s)]
*  So the power did go out for a little while. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2007.98s)]
*  According to the electric company, the power was restored [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2010.8600000000001s)]
*  and was not connected to to the water. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2014.74s)]
*  So you got the lease. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2018.0200000000002s)]
*  But I mean, the long the short answer to the long history of water [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2019.02s)]
*  battles on in Maui County is is going back to the plantation days [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2025.38s)]
*  when corporations essentially took ownership of the water. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2030.3s)]
*  So, you know, it's the native Hawaiian system of the ahupua is you have [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2033.7s)]
*  the mountains, rainfall comes streams. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2038.74s)]
*  You have this natural ecosystem of waterways that go from the top [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2041.94s)]
*  of the mountains out to the ocean and Hawaii's agriculture systems [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2045.74s)]
*  and wetlands and fishponds. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2048.78s)]
*  Everything was built around that. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2050.0600000000004s)]
*  These corporations came in, took over and literally took ownership [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2052.0600000000004s)]
*  of the water on Maui in many, not all of it, but most of it, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2057.1000000000004s)]
*  and started diverting those streams [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2060.7400000000002s)]
*  so that the water fed directly into their lands, plantations [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2064.94s)]
*  and then ag land and then now very wealthy landowners, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2070.02s)]
*  golf courses, resorts, et cetera. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2074.6200000000003s)]
*  But the effect of that was places like Lahaina [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2076.94s)]
*  that was traditionally a wetland. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2080.18s)]
*  It was it was called the Venice of Maui. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2082.38s)]
*  It was lush. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2086.06s)]
*  There were fishponds and farms and all of this stuff [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2087.06s)]
*  because of that water diversion. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2090.66s)]
*  It's like a desert there now, which is why these wildfires keep happening. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2092.66s)]
*  And traditional farming communities and native Hawaiian lands [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2096.86s)]
*  were were bled dry because the water was diverted to private corporations. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2100.7000000000003s)]
*  So fast forward to how did that impact the fires? [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2104.54s)]
*  Sorry, what year did that happen around? [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2107.34s)]
*  I mean, this was 1800s, 1850s. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2109.3s)]
*  Yeah, this was yeah. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2112.94s)]
*  But the big five, the Huinui, the big five you're talking about. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2114.58s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2117.3s)]
*  The big five plantation owners that came in. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2118.22s)]
*  But the problem has compounded generation after generation after generation. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2121.9s)]
*  And so so. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2128.2599999999998s)]
*  Firefighters didn't have access to water when they needed it [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2131.74s)]
*  to to effectively try to fight these fires. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2136.2599999999998s)]
*  There was a hurricane winds, and so obviously it grew and spread [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2140.2999999999997s)]
*  like a blowtorch across the town of Lahaina. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2143.58s)]
*  But even in the other, you know, in upcountry Maui and Kula, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2146.1s)]
*  when I went up and talked to some of the residents up there [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2150.3399999999997s)]
*  who also saw, I don't know, it was like almost 600 acres [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2153.54s)]
*  that were burned through. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2158.18s)]
*  Homes were burned down and they were trying to help each other. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2161.18s)]
*  Neighbors are trying to help each other because you see, OK, hey, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2164.34s)]
*  there's fire starting. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2166.54s)]
*  Let's all get our hoses and turn on the water and try to do what we can [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2167.74s)]
*  until the firefighters get here. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2170.9s)]
*  They turned on their hoses and it was just like dribbles, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2172.7s)]
*  dribbles of water. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2176.58s)]
*  And so literally they're going and like scooping water out of their toilet bowls. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2178.38s)]
*  And like, oh, gosh, there's a little bit of water, like from the last time [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2183.34s)]
*  it rained, stuck in like our kids bucket, like literally [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2186.94s)]
*  getting water from wherever the bottles of water, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2189.94s)]
*  trying to fight fires in their community to save people's homes. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2192.86s)]
*  Watching and watching people dying while that's happening, watching children burn. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2197.26s)]
*  I was talking to my friend. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2201.34s)]
*  He was a big part of my campaign. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2202.7400000000002s)]
*  The last campaign, he said, hey, BJ, children, animals burning. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2204.78s)]
*  You're trying to fight it with water that you don't have. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2208.9s)]
*  I mean, you just so many. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2212.26s)]
*  And so there was a request. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2214.06s)]
*  There was a request that was put in to the state [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2215.7000000000003s)]
*  to to divert the water [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2219.18s)]
*  so that it could be used to fight the fires. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2222.3799999999997s)]
*  And there was some kind of like six or eight hour [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2226.06s)]
*  delay before that decision was made. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2228.98s)]
*  And I don't know the answer yet as to what that delay was. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2232.06s)]
*  But the fact that the fact that the people of Maui [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2237.5s)]
*  don't have control over their own water [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2242.54s)]
*  is is exactly the problem, both in this crisis, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2247.5800000000004s)]
*  but on a daily basis where families are told, hey, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2251.9s)]
*  you know, countywide, there's a drought right now. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2256.1400000000003s)]
*  Everybody needs to conserve water. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2258.7400000000002s)]
*  You know, you've got to be limited with don't wash your car and all this other stuff. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2260.78s)]
*  But meanwhile, they go and drive through one of these resorts [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2264.98s)]
*  and they see all the sprinklers off of the golf courses [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2268.26s)]
*  and they see no restrictions whatsoever in in the hotels. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2271.42s)]
*  And it's no wonder why people there are like, what the heck is going on here? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2276.1800000000003s)]
*  You guys, you guys really only care about these resorts, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2279.9s)]
*  but you don't actually care about the fact that a mother can't bathe [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2284.5s)]
*  her child because of the water restrictions. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2289.06s)]
*  It's insane. It is. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2293.26s)]
*  It is literally the definition of insane. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2294.9s)]
*  It's always been like it's always been like these battles have been the [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2297.38s)]
*  yeah, the golf course sends the fertilizers into the water. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2300.06s)]
*  Then affect affecting the fish like Kona and different things. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2304.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's always been this. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2309.6200000000003s)]
*  And so this is the thing is like, so how do we solve this? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2311.6200000000003s)]
*  I mean, this has been a generations long battle for the right to water, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2316.7400000000002s)]
*  which is the one thing that every living thing needs to survive. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2320.7000000000003s)]
*  Water and the people there are fighting for that right to their own water. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2326.02s)]
*  And this is big. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2332.8199999999997s)]
*  This is big on the big island, on the whole Hamakua coast. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2334.2599999999998s)]
*  There are senators, state senators and everything every day diverting. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2339.66s)]
*  There are these streams that they're they're pretty good size. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2344.4199999999996s)]
*  We call them rivers, but they're I think the the tech, the technical name, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2347.7799999999997s)]
*  their streams, you know, because I don't think there's too many rivers [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2352.1s)]
*  like Mississippi or nothing. That's a river. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2355.1s)]
*  But we got to maybe just on that Hamakua coast, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2357.62s)]
*  we got 70 rivers, it's 50 miles, and they just keep diverting them on the top. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2361.02s)]
*  But even more, even more eye catching is when you're driving on the road, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2366.94s)]
*  Hamakua coast, the most beautiful green place in the world with 70 rivers. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2370.5s)]
*  I live right on there on Hamakua coast, and you can't jump in the car [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2375.18s)]
*  without asking yourself how many trees, how many worthless, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2378.58s)]
*  crappy trees can I count before I count one tree with food, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2382.9s)]
*  not one tree with food. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2387.38s)]
*  And you can only sit there and think that's not an accident. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2388.74s)]
*  That's not an accident that there's no food anywhere on this 50 miles [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2392.8199999999997s)]
*  that you would have to walk back to Hilo or walk all the way to Honokaa city [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2396.9399999999996s)]
*  or Honokaa town to go get some food. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2402.02s)]
*  And, you know, I it's a law, actually, in Hawaii [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2404.54s)]
*  that you cannot put any of trees with fruit on on it anywhere. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2409.06s)]
*  And it just makes you wonder. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2415.58s)]
*  It just makes you wonder that what's the law? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2417.38s)]
*  You know, you you can't put tree. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2419.86s)]
*  You can't put trees with fruit on public lands. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2421.46s)]
*  Trees with fruit on that. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2425.18s)]
*  And and why? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2426.3s)]
*  And I know that's everywhere. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2429.18s)]
*  But look over here. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2430.82s)]
*  Look at all the trees you see. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2432.02s)]
*  Why isn't there food? [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2433.5s)]
*  Because they rather push stuff like social classes, stuff like the EBT card [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2434.98s)]
*  and these different things. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2440.02s)]
*  Why is there no food and any of the trees? [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2441.5s)]
*  Just think about it in your head. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2443.62s)]
*  Take a drive down the road and say, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2444.9s)]
*  today, I'm going to count how many trees I count before I see one tree with food. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2446.54s)]
*  Will you see one tree with food? [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2450.62s)]
*  You know, and and that's what I've been talking about. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2452.82s)]
*  I mean, I talk about that all the time. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2456.38s)]
*  And it's you know, it's it's to push these things. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2458.58s)]
*  It's it's almost like they started eradicating all the pigs, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2461.42s)]
*  eradicating the cows, because you see them. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2465.6600000000003s)]
*  You see the wild cows, the wild pigs all the time on the big island. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2468.2200000000003s)]
*  And they started eradicating those things. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2471.7000000000003s)]
*  And it's almost like I'd hate to think that they were. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2473.34s)]
*  It's like they want us to compete only for the food that comes in on the boat. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2476.86s)]
*  That's the only food they want. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2480.98s)]
*  Like the Hunger Games. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2482.3s)]
*  You guys are all one point five million of you [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2483.6600000000003s)]
*  are going to compete for the food on the boat. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2486.5s)]
*  Well, the wild pig thing is interesting because the wild pig thing is big in Texas, too. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2488.7400000000002s)]
*  And it's really just about eradicating them because they destroy all the [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2493.42s)]
*  all the farmlands. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2497.6600000000003s)]
*  Like they destroy the crops and they make so many babies. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2498.6200000000003s)]
*  Like pigs have pigs start their first litter at six months. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2502.7s)]
*  And then they'll have, you know, as many as like 12 babies in a litter [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2506.46s)]
*  and they'll have three litters a year. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2510.8199999999997s)]
*  And they just bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2512.3399999999997s)]
*  And then they just start destroying. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2515.8199999999997s)]
*  It's like the same thing that I said when I was in Molokai, when we were [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2517.74s)]
*  when we were campaigning and I said, they say [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2521.74s)]
*  that you guys have a deer problem. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2525.22s)]
*  But how is unlimited food a problem? Right. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2527.62s)]
*  I want to know how is unlimited food a problem? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2530.02s)]
*  And I understand you got to fence off or you do your different things. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2532.3799999999997s)]
*  Or maybe they can corral all these animals and do different things with them. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2536.1s)]
*  But we have to we have to start thinking of ways. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2540.3399999999997s)]
*  They talk about sustainability. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2543.14s)]
*  But the way they talk about sustainability, they want to do it with electric cities. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2545.14s)]
*  You know, they want to make these electric cities. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2549.2999999999997s)]
*  They just passed it in Hilo. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2551.1s)]
*  And they said Hilo was one of the lucky people [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2553.1s)]
*  to pass one of these United Nations electric cities in in Hilo. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2556.74s)]
*  And but it makes me wonder to the mayor who let it go. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2560.7s)]
*  Mr. Mr. Roth, who I actually know personally. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2564.94s)]
*  But what you know, are you the mayor of the UN? [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2568.42s)]
*  Are we going to make our Hilo cities over here? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2571.8199999999997s)]
*  I mean, you hear all the time in 1800. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2574.3399999999997s)]
*  It took all the way to 1800 to get one billion people. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2577.94s)]
*  And in 1800, we started using coal and oil and fossil fuels. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2581.58s)]
*  And then we jumped to 200 people within that time. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2586.2599999999998s)]
*  So we jumped seven billion within the time of 200 years. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2589.3s)]
*  Right. So you know what? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2593.02s)]
*  So you'd have to just think, well, if Ige signed a bill [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2595.54s)]
*  that we can't burn coal anymore in Hawaii and. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2599.1400000000003s)]
*  And oil, we're still using gasoline, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2604.9s)]
*  but they want to push these electric cities now with electric cars and all these things. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2608.9s)]
*  But you would just have to think if it oil and coal [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2613.7400000000002s)]
*  made this much people, what's this going to do? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2618.34s)]
*  Because we're not going to have enough electricity or, you know, we're we're not there yet now. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2620.98s)]
*  Well, it's not just that. But is it what they're doing in Oregon? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2625.58s)]
*  You know what they're doing in Oregon? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2628.3s)]
*  They're they're making people think it's one of their state to [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2629.6200000000003s)]
*  they're going to have these GPS devices. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2632.7400000000002s)]
*  They attach to your electric car. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2635.54s)]
*  So it taxes you for the amount of electricity that you use. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2637.6600000000003s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2641.1800000000003s)]
*  So for every mile that you go, you have to pay a certain carbon tax [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2642.02s)]
*  because electricity is being generated by something that generates carbon. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2645.98s)]
*  Yeah. Like, so the idea that this is supposed to be carbon free is fucking stupid [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2650.86s)]
*  because you have oftentimes coal powered electric plants [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2655.18s)]
*  that are firing up extra because so many people need electricity for their electric cars. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2660.22s)]
*  So you're putting more particulates in the air. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2666.42s)]
*  You're putting more carbon in the air. And it's bananas. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2668.7400000000002s)]
*  Isn't that why they say you should buy an electric car to put less carbon in the air? [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2671.82s)]
*  But now they're going to tax you for it. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2675.62s)]
*  The whole thing is so crazy. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2677.86s)]
*  Like, you certainly do while you're driving, right? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2679.2200000000003s)]
*  While you're driving, you personally, while you're driving, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2681.54s)]
*  if you drive an electric car, you're not polluting. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2684.58s)]
*  But what did it take to make that car? [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2686.58s)]
*  What did it take to get that car here if you bought it from another country? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2688.42s)]
*  I mean, just the amount that one of those giant ships [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2691.46s)]
*  that moves cars over from Germany. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2696.1s)]
*  Do you know how much fucking fuel those things burn? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2699.02s)]
*  It's insanity. It's insanity. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2701.82s)]
*  Oh, and you get here. Look, we're green. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2704.18s)]
*  Bitch, you aren't green. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2706.02s)]
*  What made that thing? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2707.2599999999998s)]
*  What if you got one from China? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2708.8999999999996s)]
*  What made that thing? [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2710.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. It's crazy. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2711.94s)]
*  Yeah. It's crazy. I mean, and how are all of these people going to stay warm? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2714.8599999999997s)]
*  What about their air conditioner? [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2719.74s)]
*  I mean, do we have enough energy for these people? [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2721.02s)]
*  Well, you'll be trapped. You'll be trapped. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2723.2599999999998s)]
*  So just so if we had oil and and coal to bring us this far, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2725.02s)]
*  does that mean we're just going to have to go this far now? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2731.06s)]
*  As far as the population? [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2733.5s)]
*  Well, there's also this talk of 15 mile cities. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2734.7s)]
*  Tell me about those. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2737.9s)]
*  I don't know much about the ideas you'll essentially say. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2738.7s)]
*  What this city is. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2740.82s)]
*  That's what this city is. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2741.74s)]
*  But it will essentially be contained unless you get permission to leave. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2742.9s)]
*  That's true. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2746.98s)]
*  How do you put this in the idea that they're starting to roll out in Europe? [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2747.58s)]
*  They're talking about I think they've already implemented this somewhere. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2752.22s)]
*  Well, you would you would think you would think, well, I'm just thinking about Lajana [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2755.18s)]
*  when you're talking about this, because you would think, well, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2758.34s)]
*  how are they going to put us on that land of these 15 minute cities? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2760.7799999999997s)]
*  But then you would think, well, how are they going to get us off our land? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2763.7799999999997s)]
*  But they just have in Lajana. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2766.58s)]
*  They just got these people off their land. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2767.9399999999996s)]
*  And if you go. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2770.14s)]
*  Well, they're talking about they haven't done it. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2770.8999999999996s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2772.5s)]
*  They can't they cannot go on their land now because there's a there's a 80 year old fella. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2773.54s)]
*  And he he wants his house burned down and his safe is in there. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2778.3399999999997s)]
*  And he wants to go check on his safe, but he can't get in. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2782.74s)]
*  He can't get in the property. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2785.7799999999997s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2787.18s)]
*  But we're assuming eventually he can get in. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2788.54s)]
*  Right. They haven't kicked the people off their land. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2790.66s)]
*  If FEMA doesn't if FEMA doesn't steal his safe first or whoever is working [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2792.46s)]
*  or any workers and that kind of stuff, if everything doesn't disappear. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2796.62s)]
*  Right. But it's just interesting. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2800.82s)]
*  You would think you would be able to go there and say, no, get off your trespassing. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2802.5s)]
*  I'm going to go on my land. Right. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2806.74s)]
*  You would think, right. How can it be any different? Right. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2808.26s)]
*  There's no fire anymore. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2810.62s)]
*  Can it be any different? [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2811.7s)]
*  It's impossible for these people to be keeping them off their land. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2812.98s)]
*  It's not it's not a thing that you negotiate about. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2816.14s)]
*  It's not this or that. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2819.1s)]
*  No, that's your land. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2820.38s)]
*  Get off trespassing. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2821.26s)]
*  Trespassers will be shot or whatever it is. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2822.62s)]
*  I mean, you know, I understand not wanting tourists to go view it. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2825.22s)]
*  Yeah. But if you can show identification, this is my land. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2828.42s)]
*  They should let you right through. Yeah. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2832.5s)]
*  100 percent. I know. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2833.78s)]
*  So far after that, your safe is there. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2835.3s)]
*  You're an 80 year old man. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2837.42s)]
*  You just want to see if your money's there. Yeah. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2838.58s)]
*  I know an initial concern was the the toxicity of what happened there. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2840.7s)]
*  But the reality is with all of the the recovery teams [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2847.6600000000003s)]
*  that have been going through there, all the federal officials, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2851.78s)]
*  like all of the the government visitors that have gone there, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2853.78s)]
*  there is no excuse why they can't tell this 80 year old guy, hey, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2858.34s)]
*  here's a mask that will protect you from breathing in all this crap. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2862.42s)]
*  Go to your land. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2867.7000000000003s)]
*  It is funny, because as kids, we played in asbestos our whole lives. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2868.5400000000004s)]
*  We've cleaned it up thousands of times, put it in trash bags. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2872.42s)]
*  Jumping was on the ceilings before when we were kids, that white stuff. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2876.1s)]
*  I haven't heard of anybody with asbestos. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2881.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I could be wrong. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2883.3799999999997s)]
*  I just don't know who it is. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2884.8199999999997s)]
*  People got cancer from it, for sure. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2886.1s)]

*  Very. We used to be we literally used to play in that stuff. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2890.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Well, they said off the roof and not and all that. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2893.8199999999997s)]
*  And we're still here. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2897.74s)]
*  Well, listen, there was lead paint in people's houses. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2899.2599999999998s)]

*  What are those 15 minutes? [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2905.1s)]
*  Yeah, I'm curious. What are the plans for these? [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2907.1s)]
*  So I I've heard of it. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2909.2200000000003s)]
*  But as I look it up, there's an article from Canada [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2910.7000000000003s)]
*  that says it's a little bit of a conspiracy theory. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2913.5s)]
*  Canada is a conspiracy theory. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2915.98s)]
*  Canada is literally a functioning conspiracy theory. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2918.02s)]
*  It's just a concept to bring things to within 50. Right. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2920.6200000000003s)]
*  But but isn't there something going on a 15 minute city that they tried in the UK? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2923.34s)]
*  Is there something along those lines? [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2927.58s)]
*  Just just Google that 15 minute city in UK. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2930.86s)]

*  Just Google that 15 minute city in UK. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2935.7s)]
*  15 minutes, I know it's going to come up. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2938.62s)]

*  Electric Electric City or something. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2943.66s)]
*  Right. Well, I mean, they've talked about walkable communities for a long time. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2945.9s)]
*  I don't know. 15 minute hysteria. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=2949.06s)]

*  from going out or having checkpoints, that's what gets people concerned. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3113.18s)]

*  They should be. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3121.58s)]

*  where, you know, you had to have a vaccine to even fly into this country [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3124.58s)]
*  as recently as very recently ago. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3128.14s)]
*  I mean, is it still the case? [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3130.7s)]
*  Do you still have to be vaccinated to fly in? [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3131.94s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3133.86s)]
*  My friends just came from Australia and they said you do. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3135.06s)]
*  And it's going to start back up, right? [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3137.5s)]

*  The White House press secretary lady, she was just talking about the vaccines. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3144.18s)]
*  The vaccines work like have a seat. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3147.46s)]
*  Have a seat. They work. How? [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3150.78s)]
*  You see the Cleveland Clinic study that shows that the more vaccinated you are, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3152.58s)]
*  the more likely you are to get COVID. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3155.54s)]
*  Means that as of 12, 1 a.m. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3158.1s)]
*  on May 12, 2023, non-citizen, non-immigrant air passengers [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3161.2999999999997s)]

*  Well, maybe they made you have proof in Australia to leave. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3168.62s)]
*  I don't know. Maybe it's an Australian thing. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3172.02s)]
*  I mean, non-citizen, non-immigrant. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3175.98s)]
*  It was because if you come across the border, they just let you come in. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3178.98s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3181.18s)]
*  If you come across the border. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3182.02s)]

*  And thing, by the way, American National volunteer program. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3188.7s)]
*  What? Which Oregon thing? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3192.22s)]
*  The Oregon GPS thing for EV vehicles. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3193.3s)]
*  Yeah, but the idea is the tax people. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3196.14s)]
*  It's to tax them. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3198.18s)]
*  Well, because according to this, they weren't. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3199.42s)]
*  It's like a way to supplement the people who are being taxed at the gas pump [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3201.14s)]
*  versus people who are not being taxed when they pump their EV cars. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3205.1s)]
*  Yeah. But you're still. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3208.74s)]
*  Who would volunteer to pay a few? [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3209.74s)]
*  No one's going to volunteer. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3211.66s)]
*  But the idea is they're setting up this eventual precedent [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3212.7s)]
*  where you're going to get taxed on the carbon that you use. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3216.3s)]
*  Period. Right. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3219.94s)]
*  So you'll have some sort of an app and we have to really fight against this. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3221.3s)]
*  If you're going to have an app that shows your carbon footprint. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3225.38s)]
*  Now, it's really ironic is when you have guys like Bill Gates, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3228.5800000000004s)]
*  who owns four private jets. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3231.9s)]
*  Yeah. Just one of those jets in one day spews out more carbon [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3233.9s)]
*  than your car does in the whole fucking life you use. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3239.6200000000003s)]
*  And this guy is flying all over the place, telling everybody [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3243.02s)]
*  that they're going to have to eat fake meat. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3245.38s)]

*  When you look at people like Bill Gates, you look at people like John Kerry. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3248.5s)]

*  They're starting to see through these politicians lies [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3460.74s)]
*  and and are actively looking for leaders who actually care about the people [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3465.22s)]

*  See if you can find the Facebook tweet where he's talking about Facebook [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3500.26s)]
*  censoring people for ad revenue, even in and limiting their post, [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3503.86s)]
*  even if what they're saying is true, which is which is where it gets really creepy. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3509.58s)]
*  Yeah. You know, because it's one of the things that happened with Tucker Carlson. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3513.54s)]
*  They they demoted his video. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3517.2200000000003s)]
*  So it was seen by approximately 50 percent less people. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3519.94s)]
*  They limited the reach. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3522.86s)]
*  And what he was saying was absolutely true. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3524.5s)]
*  Nothing he's saying is inaccurate. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3526.38s)]
*  And they got a note from the federal government. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3528.06s)]
*  You need to do something about this to take it down. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3530.7000000000003s)]
*  They said, we can't take it down. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3532.54s)]
*  Yeah, because it's true. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3533.58s)]
*  And they said, well, you need to demote it. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3535.34s)]
*  Here it is. The Facebook cave to far left pressure groups [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3536.9s)]
*  and now allows them to silently dictate policy in exchange for ad money. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3539.54s)]
*  I think that the big news [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3544.54s)]
*  that people should take away from what you just said, Joe, is [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3546.7799999999997s)]
*  that the excuse that these corporations always give is like, hey, we're private companies. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3550.18s)]
*  We can do whatever we want. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3554.02s)]
*  But the fact that we are now seeing more and more evidence [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3555.82s)]
*  that they are censoring people at the direction of people in the White House [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3558.38s)]
*  and people in the federal government or the FBI or other law enforcement agencies [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3562.54s)]
*  is is the most chilling violation of of our First Amendment rights. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3566.94s)]
*  So this is says that the advertising boycott battering Facebook is unlike [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3571.6200000000003s)]
*  anything the social media giant has faced in 16 year history. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3575.78s)]

*  With pullouts mounting, the company's name constantly tied to racism [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3594.06s)]
*  and hate in the news coverage, CEO Mark Zuckerberg responded by live streaming [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3597.14s)]

*  Then on Wednesday, Facebook's powerhouse policy and communications chief, [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3609.22s)]

*  The boycott emerged as a crucial test for a company that has become a key [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3622.3399999999997s)]

*  Because when people people screenshot what they see when they try to follow my account [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3690.58s)]
*  or when they try to at mention me in a repost, [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3696.5s)]
*  they get this warning screen that comes up from Metta or from Instagram that says, [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3700.38s)]
*  are you sure you want to follow this person who has repeatedly been found to be [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3705.42s)]
*  spreading disinformation? [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3710.18s)]
*  And I've gone through the things and looked at some of the examples of of what Instagram [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3712.66s)]
*  has deemed to be disinformation. And and here it is right here. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3717.98s)]
*  Exactly. The account has been repeatedly posted false information that was reviewed by [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3721.66s)]
*  independent. These fact checkers are independent. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3726.2599999999998s)]
*  Of course, independent fact checkers are one against our community guidelines. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3729.62s)]
*  Do you want to add to this account when you try to tag Tulsi Gabbard? [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3733.02s)]
*  They for the account holder for me, they don't allow any any means to appeal or [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3735.98s)]
*  you know, provide counter evidence to these fact checkers. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3741.3s)]
*  And some of these posts provide you with the posts are they in the one example I'm [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3744.5s)]
*  thinking of is one where I cited the UN article and it was an actual article reporting [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3749.5s)]
*  the UN statement essentially legitimizing pedophilia, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3754.3s)]
*  saying that sex with minors shouldn't be demonized. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3760.46s)]
*  And I'm paraphrasing. I don't remember the exact article. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3763.1000000000004s)]
*  But that was that was the statement. And I posted a shot of the headline and the [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3764.9s)]
*  article, which was clearly cited. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3769.0600000000004s)]
*  And the independent quote unquote independent fact checkers said that I have [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3771.5800000000004s)]
*  misinterpreted the article. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3778.1400000000003s)]
*  And therefore, that was, you know, what can we see with that? [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3781.6200000000003s)]
*  The actual article says what does the actual article say? [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3784.34s)]
*  Let me see if I can find it. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3788.0600000000004s)]
*  Jamie can probably find it. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3790.5s)]
*  The it was a UN. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3791.6600000000003s)]
*  It was a UN statement or policy that was was passed. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3793.1000000000004s)]
*  Were they trying to use the term minor attracted people? [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3798.1400000000003s)]
*  I don't know that they use that term, but they insane. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3801.3s)]
*  Yeah, that one's it is. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3805.0600000000004s)]
*  It is insane. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3806.5s)]
*  And that's like saying a murder is a murder attracted person. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3807.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Someone attracted to killing people. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3809.94s)]
*  The criminals do more than us to take care of the pedophiles. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3812.1s)]
*  And it's sad. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3815.14s)]
*  Right. Once you're in jail. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3816.58s)]
*  Criminal. Yeah. They do more than us. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3817.66s)]
*  We do nothing. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3819.38s)]
*  I don't know what I'm looking for again. I have something. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3820.7799999999997s)]
*  But I would I would look for like United Nations sex with minors. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3822.5s)]
*  I found this is from a few months ago. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3829.7799999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. They legalized it. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3832.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, they're not in the business of legalizing things, but they're in the [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3835.02s)]
*  business of advocating for policy changes. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3838.18s)]
*  And so the idea was on their side was what to stop demonizing people that are [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3841.5800000000004s)]
*  attracted to minors. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3846.86s)]
*  Right. That it should not be. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3847.9s)]
*  How scary is that? [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3850.26s)]
*  Yeah. And every one of their policies is the kind of stuff that somebody like [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3851.5400000000004s)]
*  Governor Green follows. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3855.7400000000002s)]
*  He follows. I mean, from what I've seen. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3857.5s)]
*  But that's insane. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3859.7000000000003s)]
*  I know that's insane. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3860.98s)]
*  All the politicians, they push. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3862.34s)]
*  It's like that's how you get to the next level. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3865.6600000000003s)]

*  AP claims claim a new United Nations report calls for decriminalizing sexual [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3873.82s)]

*  AP's assessment false report published in March by the International Commission of [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3880.54s)]

*  It did not call for decriminalizing all sexual activity between minors and adults. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3892.26s)]
*  Spokesperson for the UN and the Commission confirmed the facts. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3896.9399999999996s)]
*  The claim began when an April 14 blog post entitled UN report calls for [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3900.2599999999998s)]
*  decriminalization, decriminalization of all sexual activity, including between [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3904.58s)]

*  on Twitter, Instagram and TikTok. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3918.7s)]
*  Is that it? Does it show the actual what actually the UN said? [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3921.58s)]
*  That's all it shows on this website. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3925.8599999999997s)]
*  Oh, well, that's not. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3927.14s)]
*  I think it's interesting. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3928.06s)]
*  I mean, I'm seeing a whole lot of parsing of words, like the bridge, the bridge [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3929.2599999999998s)]

*  people to believe that they said that, that they said that that seems just [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3938.4599999999996s)]
*  insane as it is. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3943.66s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3953.74s)]

*  Try this in duck, duck, go. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3955.74s)]
*  Well, it won't be curated, Jamie. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3957.74s)]

*  uncomfortable. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3968.22s)]
*  The very first things that come up. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3968.8999999999996s)]
*  The UF. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3969.8999999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3970.3799999999997s)]
*  Well, that's good. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3970.8999999999996s)]
*  That means it's probably not true. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3971.62s)]
*  Let's find out if it is true. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3973.3399999999997s)]
*  Fact check post misrepresents post. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3975.1s)]
*  What is. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3977.5s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3978.3399999999997s)]
*  So scroll down to that one. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3978.8199999999997s)]
*  New UN report advocates for decriminalizing sex with minors. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3980.7s)]
*  So this is one of those websites is from April 16th. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3984.86s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3988.82s)]
*  What does it say? [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3990.3s)]
*  Principle 16 titled consensual sexual conduct reads consensual sexual [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3992.42s)]
*  conduct, irrespective of the type of sexual activity, the sex gender, [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=3998.62s)]
*  sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression of the people [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4004.02s)]
*  involved or their marital status may not be criminalized in any circumstances. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4008.58s)]
*  Consensual same sex as well as consensual different sex, sexual relations, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4013.46s)]
*  or consensual sex relations with or between trans non-binary or other [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4018.9s)]
*  gender diverse people or outside marriage, whether premarital or extramarital may [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4024.5s)]
*  therefore never be criminalized with respect to the enforcement of criminal [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4029.86s)]
*  law, any prescribed minimum age of consent to sex must be applied in a [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4033.5800000000004s)]
*  non-discriminatory manner. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4039.38s)]
*  Enforcement may not be linked to the sex, gender of the participants or age of [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4041.14s)]
*  consent to marriage. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4045.86s)]
*  Moreover, sexual conduct involving persons below the domestically prescribed [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4046.98s)]
*  minimum age of consent to sex may be consensual in fact, if not in law. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4052.58s)]
*  In this context, the enforcement of criminal law should reflect the rights [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4060.02s)]
*  and capacities of persons under 18 years of age to make decisions about engaging [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4064.2200000000003s)]
*  in consensual sexual conduct and their right to be heard in matters concerning [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4071.02s)]
*  them. Pursuant to their evolving capacities and progressive autonomy, [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4076.02s)]
*  persons under 18 years of age should participate in decisions affecting them [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4081.6600000000003s)]
*  with due regard to their age, maturity, and best interests and with specific [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4086.98s)]
*  attention to non-discrimination guarantees. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4091.54s)]
*  Now, that to me could be interpreted as like you say that 16 year old people [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4094.98s)]
*  should be allowed to have sex with other 16 year old people, which doesn't [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4101.0599999999995s)]
*  necessarily, you know what I'm saying? [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4105.46s)]
*  Like they're not saying older people are allowed to have sex with younger people. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4107.46s)]
*  Why not 10 years old? [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4114.18s)]
*  What we according to this statement, why wouldn't that apply to a 17 year old [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4116.5s)]
*  who's 10 or however old saying, well, hey, it was consensual. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4122.18s)]
*  Does a 10 year old have the ability to make that decision? [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4129.38s)]
*  Says the laws should reflect the rights and capacity of persons under 18 years of [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4131.62s)]
*  age to make decisions about engaging in consensual sexual conduct and their right [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4136.740000000001s)]
*  to be heard in matters concerning them. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4140.34s)]
*  But the thing is, it's saying people under 18 engaging in sexual conduct, it [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4144.06s)]
*  doesn't say them engaging in sexual conduct with people older than that. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4151.18s)]
*  If it did, then I would say, yeah, you're legalizing pedophilia. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4158.3s)]
*  But what I think you're doing is you're allowing people under 18 to have sex, [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4163.18s)]
*  which they're going to do anyway. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4167.34s)]
*  I guess here's the issue with this statement and why I raised it as a [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4170.26s)]
*  concern is it does not, I mean, it doesn't say, well, okay, as long as you have two [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4174.7s)]
*  kids under the age of 18, but above the age of whatever 10 or 12 or, you know, is [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4182.3s)]
*  the consensual, it's so vague as to say, well, why shouldn't a 12 year old have [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4188.5s)]
*  that capacity to make their own autonomous decisions about consensual sex, [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4195.22s)]
*  whether it's with a 17 year old or a 20 year old or a 40 year old or a 60 year old. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4200.66s)]
*  It says it shall not be criminalized. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4205.42s)]
*  So it could open the door for someone interpreting that and saying that sex with [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4209.3s)]
*  someone under 18 years of age isn't criminal anymore. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4216.1s)]
*  And it's and this is the problem here is it speaks to, I mean, we've seen over and [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4220.86s)]
*  over again, well, you know, from pedophiles, well, hey, she wanted it or she agreed to [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4226.139999999999s)]
*  it or whatever, you know, or or vice versa. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4231.0599999999995s)]
*  You know, teachers who are sexually abusing kids in their grade schools, middle schools [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4233.98s)]
*  or whatever, saying, well, it was consensual for a teacher to have sex with their 13 [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4238.38s)]
*  year old student. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4243.179999999999s)]
*  Right. But when you posted this, what did you what did you find? [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4245.42s)]
*  I got to look and see what you posted. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4249.78s)]
*  Yeah. It's weird to make a law like that. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4251.82s)]
*  Like, what are you saying? You're saying that young kids can have sex legally. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4256.179999999999s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? Like, I don't know what you're saying there, because it [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4260.62s)]
*  like if they're saying that, you know, it shouldn't be a crime for 17 year olds to [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4264.0599999999995s)]
*  have sex with each other. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4269.86s)]
*  OK, I agree with that. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4271.54s)]
*  But if you're saying other people can have sex with them, like I think 18 is a good [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4273.98s)]
*  number. 18 is a good number. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4279.26s)]
*  It's a good legal, especially for men. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4281.62s)]
*  It's a good legal cutoff number. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4284.1s)]
*  When you start. If they're saying that you should be able to have sex with people who [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4286.14s)]
*  are minors, I would imagine it would be like way more laid out than that. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4292.46s)]
*  Which is kind of which is basically what they're saying is that. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4297.62s)]
*  The capacity for anyone under the age of 18 to make their own decisions. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4302.58s)]
*  Right. To provide consent. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4309.74s)]
*  And that's where it just like, you know, you get into the whole power dynamic again of [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4311.9400000000005s)]
*  teachers and students, right. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4315.9400000000005s)]
*  Boss, you know, I mean, not actually not bosses, but people who are in positions of [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4317.3s)]
*  authority or power. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4321.1s)]
*  How you know, OK, yeah. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4323.1s)]
*  How does a 10 year old or a 12 year old have the capacity to make that decision for [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4325.820000000001s)]
*  themselves or to see through this person who is an authority figure in their lives, who [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4330.900000000001s)]
*  has somehow manipulated their minds to convince them that this is the right thing or [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4337.02s)]
*  this is the best thing or whatever. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4340.860000000001s)]
*  And that statement. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4342.900000000001s)]
*  About not not allowing that to be criminalized and not recognizing the parents, the [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4346.540000000001s)]
*  need to protect children. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4354.22s)]
*  Yeah. The need to protect children. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4356.540000000001s)]
*  And then you look at that statement within the context of what's happening across our [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4358.26s)]
*  country and the world where our kids are being sexualized in like kindergarten, first [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4362.42s)]
*  grade, second grade, third grade, shown these picture books that I've seen myself that are [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4367.9800000000005s)]
*  more sexually graphic than anything I've ever seen in my life that are targeted for middle [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4374.18s)]
*  school kids. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4379.14s)]
*  Yeah. Then you you match that with this policy statement coming from the UN and you see the [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4380.3s)]
*  danger here of the normalization of sexualizing our kids, of the normalization of minor [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4385.62s)]
*  attracted people, of people in positions of authority. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4391.86s)]
*  And there are leaked videos showing this saying, hey, these minor attracted people should [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4395.7s)]
*  be allowed to serve as teachers in our schools where they're they're in a position to I mean, [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4400.82s)]
*  that they are supposed to protect our kids in that position. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4407.259999999999s)]
*  And yet these minor self-identified minor attracted people are in a position where they [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4410.099999999999s)]
*  can very easily abuse that trust that parents place in them and act on their sick [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4414.46s)]
*  desire. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4422.3s)]
*  Are there any examples of minor identified people identifying themselves as minor [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4422.820000000001s)]
*  attracted people teaching kids? [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4428.780000000001s)]
*  Yes. I mean, there I've seen TikTok videos of these people. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4431.9800000000005s)]
*  There was there was a leaked like hidden someone took with their iPhone video of like a I [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4436.62s)]
*  don't know if it was a school meeting or a teacher meeting or whatever of someone from [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4442.26s)]
*  the school saying, hey, you shouldn't be you shouldn't be discriminating against someone [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4448.1s)]
*  because they're a minor attracted person. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4451.9400000000005s)]
*  What? [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4453.66s)]
*  That's what. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4454.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4455.66s)]
*  So someone who was working for the school, like in some sort of capacity to make decisions, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4456.34s)]
*  was justifying was justifying having someone who is a legitimate pedophile. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4463.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4468.34s)]
*  On staff. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4469.02s)]
*  And that's you know, of course, they'll never use that term. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4469.42s)]
*  That's so crazy that that term is like they did changing the terms changes what it is. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4471.66s)]
*  And but that's that's the power of language, though. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4476.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4479.26s)]
*  That's bananas. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4479.78s)]
*  That is that is so insane that they would go with that because I remember that was going [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4481.3s)]
*  on a few years ago and people rejected it. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4485.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4487.94s)]
*  Someone had made the term minor attracted persons and everybody blew up left and right. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4488.18s)]
*  And now it's sort of like it's OK. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4492.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4495.3s)]
*  All right. And that's why they call it a spelling rate. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4496.02s)]
*  Casting a spell. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4499.18s)]
*  It kind of is in this case. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4502.5s)]
*  Did you find out what you actually posted? [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4504.86s)]
*  But I can see taking the right away from the parents. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4507.46s)]
*  I mean, just being parents ourselves. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4510.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4513.7s)]
*  Taking the right away from parents and. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4514.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4519.38s)]
*  Taking the right away from parents. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4520.38s)]
*  That's the whole thing. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4521.54s)]
*  Here's what I said. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4522.58s)]
*  That's the whole thing. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4522.98s)]
*  In a taxpayer funded campaign to push quote unquote woke ideology onto the world, the [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4524.3s)]
*  UN is advocating for the decriminalization of adults having sex with children regardless [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4531.34s)]
*  of the child's age, so long as the child quote unquote consents. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4536.34s)]
*  At the very least, American taxpayers should not be underwriting the UN until it stops [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4541.26s)]
*  all promotion of pedophilia and sex trafficking. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4545.660000000001s)]
*  And I posted a screenshot of an article from the Washington Free Beacon that says [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4550.42s)]
*  headline UN says minors can consent to sex, which is essentially the statement that you [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4554.86s)]
*  read. And then it quotes sexual conduct involving persons below the domestically prescribed [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4562.0599999999995s)]
*  minimum age of consent to sex may be consensual if in fact, if not in law, the UN says. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4567.219999999999s)]
*  Well, that way, if they said it that way, that's that sounds to me like an adult having [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4574.139999999999s)]
*  sex with someone who's under 18 and that they can consent to that. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4580.5s)]
*  That sounds like what that says. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4584.46s)]
*  Now, why would anybody with all the problems in the world, if you're really worried about [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4586.58s)]
*  climate change, you're really worried about Russia taking over Ukraine, you're really [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4591.02s)]
*  why are you so concerned with young kids being able to consent to sex? [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4594.7s)]
*  Right. That seems insane. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4601.74s)]
*  And here's what the here's what one of the whole agenda is last. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4603.62s)]
*  But it's like you're just trying to destroy people's faith in life. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4607.22s)]
*  I mean, if I really wanted to go full tinfoil hat, you know, Yuri Besman off like [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4612.18s)]
*  conspiracy from 1984, where he was describing how the breakdown of American demoralization, [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4618.74s)]
*  the breakdown of democracy was engineered by Russia. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=4626.74s)]

*  and blows the fucking the vape smoke right out of the mask. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5009.9800000000005s)]
*  It's like we're playing a game. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5013.580000000001s)]
*  This is this is like cosplay. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5015.22s)]
*  A special interest group. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5017.26s)]
*  It's just well, and one of the most powerful of all in big pharma. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5019.02s)]
*  Every time they announce, oh, there's a new variation and we're working on [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5024.780000000001s)]
*  the new booster and it's going to be ready in six months. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5028.740000000001s)]
*  And well, there's going to be a new variation of covid by then. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5031.46s)]
*  And they're going to work for the next boost. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5035.14s)]
*  It'll be ready in another six months. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5036.46s)]
*  And I don't even think they've tested this new one on people. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5038.22s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5040.78s)]
*  It's got to be big farmer over big pharma. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5041.86s)]
*  Yeah. We got to get all that food. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5045.38s)]
*  I like that. We got to get all that food. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5047.54s)]
*  Nutrition because we're not. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5049.54s)]
*  I remember watching this thing back when I was training and it said clearly, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5051.54s)]
*  we are not homo sapiens, we are bacteria sapiens. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5055.66s)]
*  And we need to eat all that food. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5059.54s)]
*  I think the best nutritionist was Colonel Sanders when he said, [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5061.900000000001s)]
*  finger licking good, you know, don't wash your hands. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5065.46s)]
*  Eat the food, eat the poi, you know. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5069.02s)]
*  Yeah. You know, bacteria. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5071.820000000001s)]
*  I think there's something, the fact that I never get sick to the fact [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5073.22s)]
*  that I shake so many hands. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5075.66s)]
*  Yeah. Like, I used to do shows. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5076.74s)]
*  I used to do shows like I did the Chicago theater, two shows. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5079.3s)]
*  And after the 3700 people each show after the shows, [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5081.66s)]
*  I shake hands with as many people who want to take pictures. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5085.26s)]
*  I waited for hours. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5088.0599999999995s)]
*  The fucking staff hated it. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5089.379999999999s)]
*  But I should. You got to stay there. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5091.58s)]
*  I was shaking thousands of people's hands. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5093.419999999999s)]
*  I'm hugging thousands of people. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5095.339999999999s)]
*  That's how you get strong. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5096.54s)]
*  But I wasn't I wasn't getting. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5097.98s)]
*  Also nutrition, also exercise, also sleep, all those good things. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5100.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. But on top of that, there's a little bit of something [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5104.259999999999s)]
*  to being exposed to a bunch of different people's biome. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5106.54s)]
*  And when you're not like when you're locked in your house, [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5110.0599999999995s)]
*  it's actually detrimental to your immune system. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5112.339999999999s)]
*  On top of it, great creates anxiety, which is detrimental [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5114.58s)]
*  to your immune system. You're freaking out social isolation. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5117.5s)]
*  All the things are bad for your mental health, which is bad for your physical [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5120.38s)]
*  health. All those things are connected. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5123.14s)]
*  One hundred percent. And to ignore that is fucking silly. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5125.26s)]
*  Yeah. And it's crazy. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5128.14s)]
*  It was so insane to me when during the height of Covid, [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5129.5s)]
*  Jen Psaki was still the White House press secretary at that time. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5133.98s)]
*  And somebody asked her, [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5137.26s)]
*  are you in the White House going to start advocating for people to [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5140.18s)]
*  I don't know if it was exercise and eat healthy or one of the other [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5145.3s)]
*  a combination of both. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5148.42s)]
*  And she couldn't just say yes. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5150.06s)]
*  Like, of course, people should be trying to to be healthy, [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5153.14s)]
*  eat healthy and exercise. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5156.38s)]
*  All she said was we will we are we are advocating for what [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5158.06s)]
*  you know, our health experts say and our health experts say, take the vaccine. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5163.7s)]
*  Period. Right. And imagine that that lady goes from there. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5167.22s)]
*  And where is she at now? [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5169.78s)]
*  She's got her own show on MSNBC. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5170.82s)]
*  That is hilarious. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5172.9s)]
*  That's no different than someone working at the FBA and then getting a job at [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5174.98s)]
*  Pfizer. None. It's the same thing. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5178.7s)]
*  Now you're on the propaganda wing. Right. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5181.46s)]
*  And that's how the propaganda wing is created. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5183.54s)]
*  And it's no different, different than a governor signing [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5186.339999999999s)]
*  a bunch of bills to screw us all over and getting to president. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5190.74s)]
*  It's all the same stuff. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5194.299999999999s)]
*  And while we're talking about that, let's I want to ask you, Tulsi, [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5195.379999999999s)]
*  what what is the legal precedent? [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5198.62s)]
*  Like, what are you what is a governor allowed to do when the governor [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5201.66s)]
*  saying we might acquire that land and build a monument, which is fucking insane? [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5205.0599999999995s)]
*  Is that legal? Is that possible? [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5210.62s)]
*  Has that happened? [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5212.58s)]
*  I don't know that that it's happened in any other state. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5214.3s)]
*  Every state has its own state constitution and its own laws that govern [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5217.7s)]
*  what the governor what the executive branch of the state is or isn't allowed to do. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5222.54s)]
*  The concerning thing is that the governor, I think, again, [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5227.3s)]
*  it was about a week after this happened, said, I'm having my attorney general [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5231.7s)]
*  look into the legalities of the state taking ownership of the land. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5236.26s)]
*  I'm not aware that that an answer has come back on that. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5241.139999999999s)]
*  Governor Green, after the after people were rightly outraged at his statement, [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5243.9s)]
*  he tried to walk it back and saying, OK, well, we're not going to allow [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5249.5s)]
*  big developers to come in and steal the land from the people. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5252.7s)]
*  But the fact that the people's sovereign [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5256.459999999999s)]
*  right to have the decision making power over their own land and their homes [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5260.54s)]
*  has not been expressly stated is why everyone there and why all of us are so concerned. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5265.7s)]
*  Well, you should be so concerned that that's his initial statement. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5271.179999999999s)]
*  Yes. The initial statement is not, how come we can send so much money to Ukraine [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5273.98s)]
*  and we can't send that money to Maui? Right. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5278.82s)]
*  How come? Because they want us to see that, to lose faith in what's going on. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5280.7s)]
*  I believe they're not hiding it. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5284.9s)]
*  I just think there's nothing hid. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5287.099999999999s)]
*  I just think what it is, is there's no financial interest [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5289.299999999999s)]
*  for them to send money to Ukraine or, excuse me, to send money to Maui. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5292.339999999999s)]
*  There's a financial interest because of the defense contractors. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5296.139999999999s)]
*  The amount of money that's being spent. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5298.82s)]
*  There you go. Like that's propping up the people that are behind the deep state. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5300.219999999999s)]
*  And I believe just like you in Hawaii. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5304.58s)]
*  Why don't we have a hundred casino boats down Waikiki and NASCAR tracks [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5307.62s)]
*  and another stadium on the big island and jobs so our people don't have to move away [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5312.06s)]
*  because nobody has to leave the big island. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5315.900000000001s)]
*  You can fit 15, 20 million people over there. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5318.3s)]
*  That place is huge. It's huge. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5320.54s)]
*  Nobody has to leave. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5322.02s)]
*  But I believe, you know, different things. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5323.46s)]
*  You know, you got a place like if we had a economy worth like a trillion dollars, [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5326.9400000000005s)]
*  what would what would Pearl Harbor have to pay every five years? [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5333.22s)]
*  You're talking about real money. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5336.14s)]
*  You're talking about a lot of money. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5338.42s)]
*  Pohakalua, the military base on the top of the big island, [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5339.74s)]
*  that's bigger than the island of Kauai, that one base. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5343.34s)]
*  And so they're building a residential area right now. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5346.139999999999s)]
*  But how much would that residential area cost them? [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5348.7s)]
*  You know, if we actually had an economy, we need every dollar we can get. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5352.0599999999995s)]
*  Hawaii is poor. It's a it's a completely reliant on people coming in and spending money. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5356.26s)]
*  And yeah, that's all it is. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5363.0199999999995s)]
*  And that didn't happen for years. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5364.42s)]
*  But why can't we take that to the next level? [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5365.9s)]
*  100 casino boats in Waikiki. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5368.06s)]
*  I mean, everybody with money in their pockets. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5370.02s)]
*  And because I believe the military industrial complex, [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5372.34s)]
*  they'll have to pay so much just for Pearl Harbor. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5376.5s)]
*  You know, and it gets scary when they start changing because that was the Pearl River. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5379.820000000001s)]
*  When they start changing the name from river to harbor, [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5383.38s)]
*  they're doing that in Hilo now with the Wailoa River. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5385.700000000001s)]
*  It makes you wonder what's coming next. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5388.42s)]
*  You know, has anybody tried? [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5390.700000000001s)]
*  Has anybody tried to stop casino boats? [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5392.46s)]
*  Has anybody tried to put in casino boats? [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5395.3s)]
*  The debate around whether or because what do they call Vegas? [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5397.58s)]
*  The Ninth Island, right? [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5401.14s)]
*  Because a lot of people from Hawaii go to Vegas. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5402.54s)]
*  They'll go for the weekend. They'll gamble. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5404.66s)]
*  Then they'll come home. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5406.02s)]
*  I haven't I don't know the numbers recently, but for a long time, [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5407.54s)]
*  there's been this debate in Hawaii whether or not to legalize gambling in the state. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5410.94s)]
*  We are one of two states that does not allow legal gambling of any sort. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5414.54s)]
*  Do you have a lot of Hawaii and Utah? [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5419.1s)]
*  We don't have a lot. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5421.02s)]
*  We don't got nothing because of these things. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5422.06s)]
*  And so even even, you know, Department of Hawaiian Homelands, [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5424.54s)]
*  there are native Hawaiian homestead lands. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5428.94s)]
*  There have been proposals to build casinos on Hawaiian homestead lands, [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5431.86s)]
*  similar to how they have on Indian reservations in other states. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5436.74s)]
*  And even that has not passed in the state. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5440.62s)]
*  And again, I don't know. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5444.82s)]
*  I don't know. There there is something in Hawaii where. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5445.94s)]
*  Again, this is not based on current data, [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5449.62s)]
*  but the arguments I've heard in the past is people are like, hey, [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5452.7s)]
*  we see that there's a lot of negative elements that can go along with casinos. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5455.3s)]
*  We'd rather fly to Vegas, gamble there and then come back and keep Hawaii. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5459.78s)]
*  Hawaii. There are two sides to the argument. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5465.22s)]
*  I get it. But that it's not a universally supported concept, I guess is my point. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5467.66s)]
*  I guess when do you feel I mean, of course, anything will bring crime. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5471.900000000001s)]
*  I guess people bring crime. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5475.9800000000005s)]
*  But, you know, when you think about Vegas or whatever, you know, [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5477.820000000001s)]
*  I haven't been there for a little bit, but I mean, is there the crime? [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5482.46s)]
*  And the crime in Vegas had a bit of an uptick during the pandemic. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5485.339999999999s)]
*  But that's like everywhere in the world. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5489.9s)]
*  People were out of work. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5491.98s)]
*  And also the cops weren't around. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5493.379999999999s)]
*  And it was because of the George Floyd protests. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5495.46s)]
*  There was a lot of defund the police talk everywhere in the country. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5497.86s)]
*  And, you know, just like things are just more wild. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5501.179999999999s)]
*  That's calmed down. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5505.0599999999995s)]
*  Vegas seems like Vegas now just seems normal. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5505.9s)]
*  Like they do a great job in kind of squashing as much crime and violence [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5509.1s)]
*  as they can, considering the massive amount of people that fly in. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5514.38s)]
*  Look, if you are going to have a casino, you're going to have more trouble, [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5518.34s)]
*  but you're also going to have more money. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5523.5s)]
*  Yeah. So the question is, like, do you believe that people should have the freedom to gamble? [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5524.860000000001s)]
*  I do. I don't even gamble at casinos. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5529.26s)]
*  Me neither. But I believe you should be able to gamble. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5531.580000000001s)]
*  And Hawaii, when we had the 2008 financial collapse, [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5533.820000000001s)]
*  they were talking about and they were ready to put it on the ballot [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5539.06s)]
*  to start letting 18 year olds drink. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5541.660000000001s)]
*  So, I mean, we're considering letting 18 year olds drink. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5543.9800000000005s)]
*  We you know, we just we need jobs, though, either way. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5547.1s)]
*  No matter. We're not here to talk about the moral issue of all of that. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5549.620000000001s)]
*  But we need jobs. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5552.900000000001s)]
*  None of our people have to leave. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5554.9400000000005s)]
*  Hawaii is I always say that Hawaii's biggest export is our people. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5556.620000000001s)]
*  The tourists come in on the full plane and the plane leaves empty because we said nothing. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5561.900000000001s)]
*  Only thing we send is our children to move away, to use their labor in another. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5565.94s)]
*  Yeah. Their labor and their love in another state. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5570.14s)]
*  And it's hard. I mean, there was a report that just came out that showed Hawaii's [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5572.86s)]
*  highest cost of living in the country and a living wage in Hawaii. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5579.22s)]
*  In order to just live, not not do well or be wealthier. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5583.58s)]
*  The living wage in Hawaii is around one hundred thirteen thousand dollars a year. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5587.82s)]
*  Holy shit. One hundred thirteen grand. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5591.9s)]
*  We have to take care. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5594.82s)]
*  And I'll tell you, people working at the valet stand at, you know, Hotel X in Hawaii, [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5596.9s)]
*  I can pretty much guarantee is not making one hundred thirteen thousand dollars a year. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5602.74s)]
*  Are the woman who's going in and cleaning the hotel rooms as people say, how do people make it? [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5606.58s)]
*  People make it because you've got three or four generations living under one roof. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5610.42s)]
*  There you go. And that's most people working two jobs. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5613.78s)]
*  And that's why they moved to Las Vegas, because they can live by themselves [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5616.34s)]
*  with their wife and their two kids in a four bedroom house. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5619.0599999999995s)]
*  Or they're going to live with their mom. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5621.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's what they're looking at. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5623.14s)]
*  Yeah. Wow. Yeah. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5625.38s)]
*  Has there been talk about Hawaii seceding from the United States? [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5627.780000000001s)]
*  Well, that's there. There's always been talk about always there. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5632.5s)]
*  I mean, there's there's always been a sovereignty movement in Hawaii [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5635.780000000001s)]
*  who point to the overthrow of the queen, that they don't have a treaty or whatever. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5639.54s)]
*  And these things. But and and their their their effort to return Hawaii back to [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5644.5s)]
*  a sovereign. It's kind of crazy that it's America and it's five hours over the ocean and in a plane. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5649.98s)]
*  Right. It is strange. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5657.0599999999995s)]
*  That's so crazy. That's so crazy. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5659.98s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5663.78s)]
*  I mean, wondering, I mean, because I hear it all the time. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5665.78s)]
*  There is no treaty. There is no treaty signed and this and that. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5668.259999999999s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's tough. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5671.98s)]
*  We hear all our whole lives growing up as a kid. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5673.78s)]
*  But, you know, right now, I think I just my heart directed at we got to do something now. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5675.9s)]
*  I mean, the property assessment tax, that's if the guy next to you buys a house for 20 million dollars. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5684.299999999999s)]
*  Now you pay the same tax level as this guy. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5690.139999999999s)]
*  And if you were just a generational family with all your kids, just look, just like me and her. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5692.94s)]
*  And we're in the house hanging out. How are we going to pay the taxes? [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5698.259999999999s)]
*  There's no way. So the property tax has to stop now. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5701.94s)]
*  Based on the property value. Yeah. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5705.54s)]
*  So the property value goes up, your taxes go up and it essentially pushes people out. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5707.38s)]
*  And nobody can nobody can withstand this. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5711.46s)]
*  And it's it's when we saw this during Covid two is is a lot of, [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5714.3s)]
*  you know, a lot of very wealthy people from the mainland were seizing on the opportunity. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5720.7s)]
*  Like, hey, if I got to be at home and stuck at home and work from home, I'm going to go do it in Hawaii. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5724.78s)]
*  And they were throwing down, you know, a house, a single family home, not built recently, not fancy, [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5728.82s)]
*  is on the market for nine hundred grand. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5734.86s)]
*  They would throw down like one point five million dollars cash to scoop that house up off the market. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5737.54s)]
*  And this was happening over and over and over again. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5743.46s)]
*  How does any local family compete with people from the mainland coming in and throwing down millions of dollars cash? [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5746.139999999999s)]
*  And that and that drives all of the prices up. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5752.54s)]
*  I do admit, though, with all of these problems going on in America and, you know, with President Biden and everything going on, [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5756.0599999999995s)]
*  I see a lot of people who aren't Native Hawaiian trying to go over to that to that Native Hawaiian movement, [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5762.78s)]
*  because they're scared and they're, you know, they're scared themselves about what everything that's going on and [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5770.06s)]
*  what are you know, so everybody are kind of keeping them open mind to different things. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5777.14s)]
*  I mean, sure, when all the coronavirus coronavirus stuff was happening, so was Texas. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5781.22s)]
*  So was Florida. You know, everybody had a more open mind is kind of a more independent [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5786.3s)]
*  attitude is moving forward. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5792.46s)]
*  It's interesting to see that it is interesting. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5794.86s)]
*  What's interesting is if there wasn't Florida and if there wasn't a Texas, there wasn't places that were open. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5796.86s)]
*  You know, when I came here, I came here in May of 2020. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5802.78s)]
*  That's when I was already I was already like, fuck this. I was already like it was only a couple months in. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5806.42s)]
*  I was like, what happened in two weeks? Right. Like everything shut down. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5812.42s)]
*  Everything's staying shut down. All my friends that were in the restaurant industry were [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5815.02s)]
*  struggling hardcore. They lost somewhere in the neighborhood of 70 percent of the restaurants in Los Angeles. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5818.900000000001s)]
*  And now they're coming for the rest. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5824.58s)]
*  And so when that happened, I started looking out here in May and I went to a restaurant with my kids and they were like, [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5826.900000000001s)]
*  we don't have to wear a mask. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5834.06s)]
*  Like they were sitting down like we needed a restaurant like in two months. They were already like [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5835.42s)]
*  everybody was already freaked out and then we went to the lake and people are playing music and jumping in the water and [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5840.34s)]
*  they were like, we want to live here. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5846.459999999999s)]
*  Right. That'll do it. That was it. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5848.259999999999s)]
*  That's two months later I lived here. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5850.299999999999s)]
*  Isn't it crazy how Dr. Evil runs New York, California and Hawaii? [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5852.54s)]

*  Well, the concern that people have here is that people are going to move here and vote the same way. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5866.9s)]
*  And they're going to vote some totalitarian asshole and to sort of impose the same sort of laws here. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5870.259999999999s)]

*  But even on the other side, the fact that we don't heal the childhood trauma from the kids, I mean, in ninth grade, fifth grade, [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5879.9400000000005s)]

*  resentment and self-pity. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5901.219999999999s)]
*  And some some are so good, they could blame you for it and tell you that's why they hate you. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5902.62s)]
*  And that's why they're in the position they're stuck in in life. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5906.62s)]
*  Yeah. And I believe we have to do something about that. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5909.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't know if it's a therapy thing. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5912.66s)]

*  They're definitely not teaching people how to think, you know, and that's a real problem. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5931.66s)]
*  And they're certainly not teaching people about all the lies that have already been told. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5936.1s)]
*  They're not the idea that you're supposed to trust the government, which consistently lies about almost everything. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5940.14s)]

*  When you were running when you were running for governor, like, what was your experience [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5974.98s)]
*  in terms of like bumping heads with these people? [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5979.66s)]
*  I think I think the Republican Party really went against me when I [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5982.620000000001s)]
*  when I went into the Department of Education, because that's why I was running. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5988.02s)]
*  I mean, I was running for the children and I was running because if you can print [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5991.42s)]
*  all the money you could possibly ever need, why the hell are you asking us for taxes? [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5995.660000000001s)]
*  You know, type of thing. And and, you know, I I would say that's when it started. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=5999.620000000001s)]
*  When I went into the education and I told the guy today, [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6008.3s)]
*  you got to go, you got to go. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6011.62s)]
*  You walked into the Department of Education building, right? [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6013.5s)]
*  Yeah. And I said, you got you guys got to go. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6016.14s)]
*  And I think from that time, you know, whoever the powers that be behind the [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6018.58s)]
*  it's like the Women's League of Republicans, they run the Republican Party there. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6024.38s)]
*  So I think it's Lingo, Duke, [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6028.46s)]
*  Duke, Iona, Linda Lingo, Pat Syke and whoever else they put in the top of that thing. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6031.42s)]
*  And, you know, people say deep state. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6036.98s)]
*  I don't really use that word. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6039.0199999999995s)]
*  People say different things, but, you know, special interest groups. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6040.62s)]
*  But you think about it, I walk I'm walking in thinking to try to help [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6044.5s)]
*  help people and, you know, the Republicans own the businesses [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6048.94s)]
*  and the Democrats keep the money coming from Washington. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6052.62s)]
*  So they're going to love these guys. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6055.7s)]
*  They got their little hooey up on the top of a group, [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6057.459999999999s)]
*  you know, that these guys bring all the money, these guys own businesses. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6060.9s)]
*  So you're really getting shot from both sides. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6064.0199999999995s)]
*  But I think where my me and my mother talk a lot about different things. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6066.26s)]
*  And I think she was just kind of bummed out because they came to her for years. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6071.22s)]
*  The Republican Party asking for money, asking for money, asking for money. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6074.62s)]
*  What did you guys give us when we when we ran? [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6079.62s)]
*  You know, just just just an enemy. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6082.22s)]
*  So so what were you trying to do with the Education Department? [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6085.14s)]
*  Well, to get the mass off the kids, stop all of that stuff. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6089.62s)]
*  Because it was people, I mean, people would say, [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6094.66s)]
*  well, they're not speaking as good and this and that. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6096.94s)]
*  But we know what that was all about. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6099.3s)]
*  It was all about making us illiterate. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6100.66s)]
*  They don't want us to read because then we'll know what's going on. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6102.7s)]
*  You know, and that's what if you ask me, why would you keep that thing on there? [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6105.9s)]
*  But they were also getting, of course, special interest groups. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6110.7s)]
*  They were getting money, 200 and extra. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6113.18s)]
*  Yeah, but unfortunately, a lot of people believed in masks back then. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6114.82s)]
*  They did. And then people that believe in it now, they're not. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6118.54s)]
*  They're not like the purveyors of propaganda, [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6122.38s)]
*  a sense that they're not trying to control people. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6124.98s)]
*  They're just terrified people that are filled with anxiety [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6127.26s)]
*  that wear masks all the time and think you should, too. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6129.82s)]
*  You know, and I know people like that. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6132.58s)]
*  I think that's a misery enjoys company thing. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6133.98s)]
*  A little bit of it, too. Yeah. You know, there's a little bit of it, too. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6136.139999999999s)]
*  But it's also there. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6139.62s)]
*  They were under the erroneous. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6140.98s)]
*  And I've had arguments with people about this. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6142.38s)]
*  They don't have many more because now the data is out. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6143.78s)]
*  But people that were saying that masks work like, yeah, they don't. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6145.9s)]
*  They don't. They're saying it on CNN now. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6150.1s)]
*  So you tell me why you think kids should wear masks, [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6152.38s)]
*  because that's fucking bananas. Yeah. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6156.06s)]
*  But if they don't work and the statistics show they don't work, [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6158.02s)]
*  are you just doing this as like a theater? [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6160.820000000001s)]

*  Is it to make people less anxious? [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6164.620000000001s)]
*  They were they were getting a lot more money. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6166.14s)]
*  The the Department of Education in Hawaii was getting a certain amount [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6168.540000000001s)]

*  ultimately what's at the heart of this fomenting of fear by people in power [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6237.86s)]
*  is control, that if they make us afraid as a people, [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6241.46s)]
*  then we will be more accepting of them taking away our civil liberties [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6245.98s)]

*  they have to do a press conference themselves and announce this. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6397.66s)]
*  I mean, announce the results of the election, announce the results of the elections. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6401.42s)]
*  I mean, when I was there, KITV, they did a good interview with me [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6405.820000000001s)]
*  and then they kept begging me over and over, hey, can we come for the live [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6410.46s)]
*  night election night at your house? [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6414.06s)]
*  And I said, no, maybe it's not a good idea. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6415.9800000000005s)]
*  I didn't maybe my brothers might be drinking or something. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6418.42s)]
*  I don't want anything, any bad press or anything. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6420.62s)]
*  So they came over and. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6423.5s)]
*  No, they didn't come over. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6426.900000000001s)]
*  We stopped them from coming over, but they kept asking us for an interview. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6427.820000000001s)]
*  So I sat down and I did the interview with them. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6431.38s)]
*  And then I got up and my friend, my buddy goes, hey, that was a good interview. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6434.7s)]
*  The next thing I walk out the door, the next thing they play [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6439.42s)]
*  is an already edited video. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6442.820000000001s)]
*  Oh, the primary is over. Here it is. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6444.5s)]
*  We got the winners, Duke and Green. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6446.7s)]
*  So they'll they'll go on to the final. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6449.06s)]
*  And I thought, sat there for a little bit. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6450.74s)]
*  I thought maybe I should have told them to come over KITV. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6452.900000000001s)]
*  Then I would just go, hey, this is fake and slam their camera on the ground or something. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6456.26s)]
*  But I thought, huh, the news, the news runs the election. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6460.54s)]
*  These guys run the election. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6464.5s)]
*  You know, that was the first time I ever thought that. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6466.18s)]
*  And and then I thought, you know, different things, because here's the ball. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6467.900000000001s)]
*  And these guys have criminal or civil and criminal liability. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6472.1s)]
*  If if they say anything, that's why I wonder why they don't do press conferences. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6476.42s)]
*  So here they got the ball. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6480.700000000001s)]
*  Now they pass the ball to somebody who has no civil and criminal liability, [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6482.02s)]
*  which is the news. Right. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6487.06s)]
*  And now the news is holding the ball and they're the ones they're the messenger. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6488.94s)]
*  You know, they say kill the messenger, different things, but they're the messenger. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6492.5s)]
*  They're the guys who is going to tell everybody about it. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6495.9s)]
*  So you never hear from this guy. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6498.78s)]
*  The ball's over on this side. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6500.62s)]
*  And that's what I mean, I felt that I saw. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6502.139999999999s)]
*  And anybody who said and the news will be going like, no, they got the ball. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6505.339999999999s)]
*  And look, these people are lying, saying it all there or Trump in them [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6509.46s)]
*  are telling more lies about the election voting machines or Lindell or everything. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6513.74s)]
*  But I don't know who is who in the zoo. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6518.22s)]
*  We don't know who's a good guy. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6520.740000000001s)]
*  We don't know who's a bad guy. We know nothing. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6521.860000000001s)]
*  We know we don't know too much of our history. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6524.02s)]
*  You know, it just it's life's tough to kind of sift through everything going on. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6526.38s)]
*  And most people don't have the time. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6530.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And we're all stuck in the rat race. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6532.18s)]
*  There's so many bills going through every day. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6534.780000000001s)]
*  And and I'm kind of I kind of like to think about political stuff. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6536.900000000001s)]
*  But I don't have the time to find out every bill [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6542.18s)]
*  getting passed through the city county council. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6544.820000000001s)]
*  And I and I grew up with these people. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6547.299999999999s)]
*  And still you'll see different things. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6549.099999999999s)]
*  They were trying to pass this bill. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6550.94s)]
*  It's a what they're going to do is they clean up the downtown, [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6552.66s)]
*  but they put a lien on the owner of the property. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6556.62s)]
*  He gets a lien put on his property. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6558.66s)]
*  So so all the commercial people kind of went went along with it. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6560.62s)]
*  And and everybody were like, hey, we're just going to pass that bill to you. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6564.139999999999s)]
*  You're going to pass that bill to your your employee. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6568.94s)]
*  And now they're going to put parking stalls out there. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6571.86s)]
*  Everybody's just going to go to Walmart. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6574.54s)]
*  Nobody's going to come to Hilo's downtown anymore. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6576.06s)]
*  Everybody got to kind of wake up, you know, [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6578.660000000001s)]
*  and kind of figure out what's going on a little bit. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6581.18s)]
*  And these and so as soon as they were done with Hilo, they didn't get it passed. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6583.860000000001s)]
*  My mother had to jump on the downtown improvement agency [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6587.820000000001s)]
*  just to get the council to not bring the bill up again, [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6590.740000000001s)]
*  because they kept bringing it up. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6593.38s)]
*  And all they did was pick up and move to Pahoa to get the that bill passed in Pahoa. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6594.860000000001s)]
*  And then Ka'u or whatever else, whatever else they do, these things. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6599.06s)]
*  It's a nonstop. It's an onslaught. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6603.820000000001s)]
*  It's just constantly going, going. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6606.14s)]
*  And you can't be on top of all of it. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6608.02s)]
*  You can't be on top of none of it because we're all we're busy. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6609.9800000000005s)]
*  There's all this talk about it's fascinating. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6613.780000000001s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen this, but there's a video that shows like 20 minutes [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6616.620000000001s)]
*  of the Democrats denying the results of the elections. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6620.1s)]
*  Yes. That's all you've seen. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6622.620000000001s)]
*  Yes. It's really crazy because it's Hillary Clinton. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6624.06s)]
*  That's you know, he's an illegitimate president. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6627.3s)]
*  He lost the election. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6630.46s)]
*  The Russians hacked the election. All this crazy stuff. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6631.580000000001s)]
*  But when Trump says it, then it becomes a serious threat to our democracy. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6635.18s)]
*  Well, and as we're seeing now, a prosecutable offense. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6639.46s)]
*  Yes. Is in your eyes to say that the question is one of the things [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6643.900000000001s)]
*  that he's being charged with. Oh, wow. What? [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6648.66s)]
*  How much veracity is it is there to these claims? [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6652.26s)]
*  It seems like at least on some local levels, [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6655.38s)]
*  there's a constant theme of catching something. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6659.58s)]
*  There's there's people that are concerned about the voting machines. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6664.58s)]
*  There's people concerned about ballot dumping. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6668.22s)]
*  There's people concerned about mail in ballots. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6670.42s)]
*  What is your thoughts on that? [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6673.3s)]
*  There's there is no doubt there are improvements that need to be made [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6676.06s)]
*  to ensure the integrity of our elections. Period. Full stop. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6679.740000000001s)]
*  This is something that that I sought to address while I was in Congress [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6684.860000000001s)]
*  with a very, very simple piece of legislation that would have said [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6688.54s)]
*  or that would have implemented federal funding for each state [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6693.58s)]
*  to require either a paper ballot or a paper record [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6698.099999999999s)]
*  of an electronic vote that's cast. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6704.42s)]
*  That way, if there are any questions about the integrity of the election [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6707.58s)]
*  or the vote count, you would have the ability to conduct a paper [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6710.74s)]
*  audit of that election. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6714.179999999999s)]
*  We've seen time and again through these DEFCON hacking conferences [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6717.0199999999995s)]
*  they have in Vegas almost every year, how, you know, children, 12, 13, [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6720.66s)]
*  14 year old kids go in and they do these demonstrations. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6725.139999999999s)]
*  Hey, we're going to time you. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6728.26s)]
*  Can you hack into this voting electronic voting system from whatever state? [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6729.42s)]
*  And these kids are able to hack into these systems within minutes. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6734.46s)]
*  Kids, what to speak of somebody who may try to do [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6737.0199999999995s)]
*  a concerted attack and manipulate the outcome of an election. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6742.22s)]
*  So my bill is very simple. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6745.94s)]
*  We know these vulnerabilities. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6747.54s)]
*  States and counties have the federal government does not have the authority [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6749.3s)]
*  to administer elections, period. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6753.58s)]
*  That is run by the counties and the states, and that's why the laws [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6757.66s)]
*  are very different and how they choose to do it. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6760.14s)]
*  So my bill said, OK, well, there is funding that the federal government [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6762.3s)]
*  provides to these counties and states to administer these elections. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6765.42s)]
*  This federal funding should come with a baseline requirement that these elections [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6768.54s)]
*  are auditable by having some form of a paper record. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6772.86s)]
*  Nobody in Congress was interested in passing that legislation. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6776.66s)]
*  Of course not. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6780.42s)]
*  Even though we had statistics, and I believe this was in 2017 [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6781.22s)]
*  where the state of Virginia has the Commonwealth of Virginia, as they say, [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6786.42s)]
*  has off year elections. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6791.34s)]
*  So they they don't hold their statewide elections on the same year, [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6792.58s)]
*  even numbered years. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6796.26s)]
*  And that year they had was the first year that they had implemented 17 or 19. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6797.78s)]
*  But they had first implemented having some form of a paper record. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6803.54s)]
*  And it was the the year that they did not get a single question. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6807.58s)]
*  The state office of elections did not get a single question [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6812.94s)]
*  or complaint about the integrity of their elections. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6815.14s)]
*  And they did it because they saw, oh, gosh, these electronic voting systems [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6817.22s)]
*  are really vulnerable. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6821.42s)]
*  We need to do something about it. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6822.82s)]
*  And they took action. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6824.18s)]
*  The fact that this is not the case across the country is very concerning. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6825.94s)]
*  It is concerning that that you see so many of the Democrat elite [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6830.26s)]
*  dismiss people who merely ask questions about voter fraud. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6833.7s)]
*  Well, no, no, no, it doesn't occur. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6837.78s)]
*  When when I was in Congress, I shared a house with my sister [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6840.18s)]
*  and her husband there in D.C. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6843.3s)]
*  when when election time came around, they got a few ballots [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6846.58s)]
*  from the previous owners of the home who had since been deceased. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6849.9s)]
*  I don't know how many people in the country are getting ballots [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6855.26s)]
*  mailed to them to be filled out at home and returned [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6858.42s)]
*  with the names of people who died. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6862.38s)]
*  And there's no there's no verification of that. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6864.46s)]
*  So there are very clear steps that can and should be taken [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6867.1s)]
*  to increase and improve the integrity of our elections that [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6871.66s)]
*  you know, the the whole. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6877.18s)]
*  Oh, gosh, the ballot stuffing where, you know, they pay people to go out [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6879.9400000000005s)]
*  and get get ballots filled up, you know, in like [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6882.9800000000005s)]
*  older care homes and these other places. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6885.62s)]
*  You know, there are a lot of questions around that process [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6891.46s)]
*  and ensuring the integrity that need to be addressed. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6895.26s)]
*  But even if you won, let's say you did win, even though you don't know. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6898.099999999999s)]
*  Say you won. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6901.34s)]
*  What forces the news to tell the truth of who won? [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6903.14s)]
*  There's no election law. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6907.46s)]
*  There's no election law that the news is under. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6909.14s)]
*  Under there's no there's no law of anything, right? [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6911.14s)]
*  That they that they have to they have to say this. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6915.02s)]
*  They're under no civil or criminal liability to say anything. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6917.660000000001s)]
*  So even if you win the election, that's why I wonder, you know, when [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6920.9400000000005s)]
*  when even Trump or Lindell come in and they start talking about the [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6925.3s)]
*  the mail in ballots or the voting stuff is that [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6930.780000000001s)]
*  how come nobody's talking about the guy who tells everybody who won? [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6933.820000000001s)]
*  We never our whole lives, we never got to see the phone call [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6937.540000000001s)]
*  that they say they got when, oh, they just called us right now. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6940.38s)]
*  And so and so won. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6943.58s)]
*  Now they even do it before. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6944.94s)]
*  Now they even do it like a project projection style before the counting is even done. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6946.66s)]
*  They what they they say who won. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6950.9s)]
*  I mean, we got to kill the messenger. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6953.0599999999995s)]
*  We have to make a law that has a press. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6954.94s)]
*  If you're going to announce something, if Dana is going to announce something, [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6958.7s)]
*  everybody, we've always done press conferences. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6961.3s)]
*  That's what we do. That's what people do. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6964.0599999999995s)]
*  They do press conferences and the press comes. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6965.98s)]
*  But this one, they call the press behind our backs and the press says it, [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6968.5s)]
*  you know, is that is that an accident or, you know, [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6972.9s)]
*  and the whole time we're looking here, the ball's over here. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6976.38s)]
*  But what about these guys? Are we never going to look at these guys? [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6979.42s)]
*  I'm waiting for Trump to, you know, say, well, let's go look at these guys [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6982.5s)]
*  for a little bit. You know, we we didn't see what happened. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6985.74s)]
*  And it makes you wonder why does CNN Google, like you said, [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6988.54s)]
*  it's been curated and Fox and all these people. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6992.34s)]
*  Why do there's nothing that holds them to that? [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6996.22s)]
*  They got to tell the truth. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6998.9s)]
*  What we need is the press conference. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=6999.86s)]
*  So if the guy doesn't tell the truth, he's incriminating himself right there. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7001.66s)]
*  He works for the he works for the government. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7006.179999999999s)]
*  I'm sure he has to have signed some kind of oath, [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7008.0199999999995s)]
*  some whether civil or criminal liability that he has to tell the truth [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7011.099999999999s)]
*  and then have all that was the case. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7015.42s)]
*  Just if that was the case with the news, they had to tell the truth. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7016.7s)]
*  Like they would be in a lot of trouble. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7019.86s)]
*  Like just just imagine just the war in Iraq, just the weapons of mass destruction. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7021.54s)]
*  Just the I mean, the Russia collusion scam that they talked about forever. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7025.34s)]
*  Yeah. The people responsible for that are totally being taken seriously in other [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7029.219999999999s)]
*  matters. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, you know, that that is I mean, that [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7033.58s)]
*  it is not when people in the mainstream media talk about, [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7037.9s)]
*  you know, the elections and election fraud and, you know, outside forces [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7042.259999999999s)]
*  coming in and trying to undermine and usurp our elections. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7046.259999999999s)]
*  They obviously never talk about themselves and how much propaganda [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7051.9s)]
*  they put out to create this facade of a democracy where essentially [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7055.54s)]
*  they work with the power elite in Washington from one party or another. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7059.7s)]
*  And they they basically decide, hey, here's the people that we we [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7063.58s)]
*  were OK with voters being exposed to. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7067.7s)]
*  These are the acceptable people. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7069.9s)]
*  And here's the people who are unacceptable to the elite. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7071.54s)]
*  And therefore we got to destroy them. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7075.26s)]
*  And this is what I went through when I ran for president in 2020, [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7077.7s)]
*  the Democratic primary from the very first day I announced through the entire campaign. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7080.26s)]
*  It was it was already decided that I was not a candidate that they found acceptable. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7084.54s)]
*  We are seeing the very end. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7091.62s)]
*  So they did everything they could to discredit and smear and, you know, [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7093.02s)]
*  media blackouts and all this. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7095.900000000001s)]
*  You are a Russian asset. Exactly. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7097.54s)]
*  And no member of the media ever said, oh, really? [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7099.3s)]
*  What evidence do you have of that? Right. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7101.9800000000005s)]
*  They just they they repeated the line over and over and over again. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7104.58s)]
*  And it worked. People believed it. Yeah. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7108.18s)]
*  And you're seeing the same thing happening now with RFK. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7110.54s)]
*  They decided, hey, this guy is speaking way too much truth. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7112.9s)]
*  And so we're going to do everything we possibly can to block voters [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7116.82s)]
*  from from hearing him. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7121.54s)]
*  And we are going to try to smear and discredit him with lies [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7123.9s)]
*  so that if they do hear him, they're not going to believe what he says. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7127.7s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, anything. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7131.94s)]
*  So many things are you wonder from the news. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7134.179999999999s)]
*  So if the news isn't true, what about history? [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7137.66s)]
*  And and it's the funniest thing. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7140.66s)]

*  The thing that that [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7227.06s)]

*  and President Biden's [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7319.78s)]

*  No one is saying, hey, we should we should probably look into this. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7325.5s)]
*  They're dismissing it all and saying, oh, you know, [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7328.78s)]
*  the only thing Joe Biden talked about with Hunter Biden's, you know, [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7332.06s)]
*  Ukrainian, Burisma executive counterparts, they talked about the weather. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7337.74s)]
*  Yeah. I heard a congressman say this, like to the media. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7342.14s)]
*  It's like, what are you guys even worried about? [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7344.580000000001s)]
*  All he talked about was the weather. Yeah. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7346.06s)]
*  They flew over to Ukraine. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7348.740000000001s)]
*  He flew over to Ukraine in 2015 with his son to talk about the weather. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7350.580000000001s)]
*  And then when they came and visited Hunter in D.C. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7354.14s)]
*  and Hunter called his dad and they talked about the weather. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7357.1s)]
*  And isn't there somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 million dollars [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7359.860000000001s)]
*  that they got from that? [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7363.580000000001s)]
*  From the. Yeah. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7365.780000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think that's that's what I've heard has been accounted for. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7366.620000000001s)]
*  But then, you know, you hear all kinds of things like, oh, well, how is it that, [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7371.0599999999995s)]

*  in their trust account? [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7379.179999999999s)]
*  Like, where does that like who? [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7380.9s)]
*  I don't know. But the fact that they're not even that there's not just an accepted [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7382.9s)]
*  standard in Washington saying, well, these accusations are being made. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7389.0599999999995s)]
*  There is evidence in communications, written evidence [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7393.42s)]
*  that couldn't have been fabricated. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7396.86s)]
*  We as elected representatives of the people have a responsibility [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7398.98s)]
*  to objectively investigate this and see where it leads. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7403.179999999999s)]
*  And same in Hawaii. Right. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7407.219999999999s)]

*  I mean, you you think about there was millions when they were talking [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7413.58s)]
*  with Hunter Biden and that was before he was a president. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7417.219999999999s)]

*  It's much easier to make that money disappear than it is to [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7425.9s)]
*  to make it disappear in Hawaii. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7429.42s)]
*  And and, you know, they have what's that that's saying? [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7431.54s)]
*  Well, just at the best, the government's a money laundering machine. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7435.54s)]
*  And at the worst, I mean, the devil himself sometimes. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7438.54s)]
*  You know, a friend of mine was telling me that [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7442.74s)]

*  Well, the industry doesn't have high ethical standards. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7564.54s)]
*  So it's like if you're the ethical ethical standards of the industry of pimping, [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7566.98s)]
*  you know, you know, you have to have high ethical standards. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7571.0599999999995s)]
*  And does not disclose the name of the buyer to Hunter Biden. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7575.54s)]
*  But just what they did with the laptop story, the fact that they suppressed [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7579.339999999999s)]
*  it from Facebook, they suppressed it from Twitter. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7582.179999999999s)]
*  They did all that. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7584.379999999999s)]
*  And when Zuckerberg was on the podcast and he said the FBI [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7585.62s)]
*  had contacted them about that, that was a sobering moment. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7588.62s)]
*  I was like, wait, what? [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7591.78s)]
*  And then when the Twitter files come out and then you read that [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7593.78s)]
*  you know, then the 51 intelligence, former intelligence agency [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7596.94s)]
*  guys that had signed off on that, that this was Russian disinformation [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7600.86s)]
*  when they had known it wasn't that that right there. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7604.54s)]
*  When you talk about interference with our elections, yeah. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7607.7s)]
*  When you when you look at some of the stuff the media is talking about [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7610.94s)]
*  and you see what happened there weeks before that twenty twenty election. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7614.26s)]
*  I think that the whole [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7619.3s)]
*  that letter came out from the 51 former senior intelligence [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7621.66s)]
*  officials in October, just prior to the November election in 2020, stating [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7624.94s)]
*  this laptop has what is it is like has all the hallmarks [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7632.74s)]
*  of of Russian disinformation based on nothing. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7637.0199999999995s)]
*  And then you go back and you look at where why was that letter instigated? [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7640.66s)]
*  Well, then, you know, whatever campaign senior advisor Tony Blinken [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7644.62s)]
*  to president to vice then vice president or vice president, former vice president Biden. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7649.379999999999s)]
*  Made a call. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7654.94s)]
*  He made a call to Mike Morrell within within the CIA [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7656.419999999999s)]
*  or former former deputy of the CIA. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7661.259999999999s)]
*  And then he called a friend and there was a CIA staffer, an active CIA staffer [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7663.86s)]
*  who helped orchestrate that letter within like a 24 hour period of time. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7668.66s)]
*  And this is all on the record. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7674.419999999999s)]
*  This is this is all Mike Morrell said this to Congress in private testimony [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7675.98s)]
*  that's since been released. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7682.26s)]
*  But this was instigated because the Biden campaign told him, [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7683.3s)]
*  hey, we need president, we need Joe Biden to have a good talking point [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7687.26s)]
*  to use in this next debate against Trump, because we know Trump is going to bring up [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7692.22s)]
*  Hunter Biden's laptop and we need to give Biden a talking point [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7696.66s)]
*  so that he can immediately dismiss the whole topic of the Hunter Biden laptop. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7700.06s)]
*  That letter from the 51 senior former intelligence leaders [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7704.34s)]
*  gave him that talking point. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7710.02s)]
*  He used it in that debate. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7712.18s)]
*  And it's what was used as the excuse to shut down the New York Post [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7714.900000000001s)]
*  and to shut down anyone who tried to publish the contents of that laptop. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7718.860000000001s)]
*  For national security reasons. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7723.82s)]
*  It's wild. And there's no repercussions. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7725.18s)]
*  There's no repercussions. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7727.14s)]
*  But you want to talk about interference in our election. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7728.46s)]
*  You withheld information from voters that may have some would say [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7730.46s)]
*  very likely would have persuaded them to not vote for Joe Biden. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7734.82s)]
*  And the people on the Democratic side, they are so against Trump [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7740.0599999999995s)]
*  that they would happily take that. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7744.58s)]
*  Yes. And that they don't care. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7747.3s)]
*  No qualms. It doesn't bother them. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7749.259999999999s)]
*  No. They're like, look, they did what we wanted to do. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7751.099999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden got into office. Right. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7754.78s)]
*  Better than Trump. It's about them. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7756.259999999999s)]
*  It's about their power. And that's it. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7757.62s)]
*  And the true believers are like, yes, better than Trump, better than Trump, [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7759.54s)]
*  better than Trump. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7763.06s)]
*  Trump's a Russian agent. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7765.660000000001s)]
*  They'll say all this crazy stuff that they've they just also heard [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7767.18s)]
*  spit out by the propaganda. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7771.34s)]
*  The facts don't matter at that point. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7772.860000000001s)]
*  Are we living in a movie? [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7775.02s)]
*  I heard people talk about the Matrix. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7776.860000000001s)]
*  Well, what is that that spoiler alert? [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7778.9800000000005s)]
*  The Matrix or whatever. We're living in a matrix. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7782.780000000001s)]
*  Well, the idea is that this is well, that's where it gets really complicated. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7785.38s)]
*  The idea is that we're involved in a simulation [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7788.5s)]
*  that all life is really just a simulation. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7791.74s)]
*  And the real problem is when you go to probability theory [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7795.1s)]
*  and when you talk to which I don't totally understand, [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7799.22s)]
*  but when they talk about the probability, [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7801.18s)]
*  it's more probable that we're living in a simulation than we're not. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7803.7s)]
*  And if the simulation can exist and if it likely as technology advances [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7807.26s)]
*  will exist, it will probably be undiscernible from reality. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7813.1s)]
*  And the idea of an entire universe [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7818.9400000000005s)]
*  that's most likely filled with intelligent life forms, [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7822.46s)]
*  that this simulation hasn't been created is smaller than the idea [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7825.58s)]
*  that a simulation doesn't exist. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7829.58s)]
*  Wow. But then again, you know, I'm a moron. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7831.26s)]
*  You talk to me about things like that. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7834.3s)]
*  I'm like, I'm just saying words that sound smart. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7836.14s)]
*  But my puny little brain is like, wait, what? [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7839.3s)]
*  What? What exactly? [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7842.9800000000005s)]
*  What are you saying? [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7845.58s)]
*  So this is not real, but it is real. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7847.66s)]
*  But there's real consequences. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7849.98s)]
*  I mean, we know that, right? [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7851.3s)]
*  The fire was real. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7852.54s)]
*  The consequences of people's lives is real. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7853.54s)]
*  That the war in Ukraine is real. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7855.18s)]
*  The people are dying. It's real. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7857.3s)]
*  You know, the propaganda machine is real. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7859.0199999999995s)]
*  East Palestine is real. Yes. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7861.0199999999995s)]
*  You know, whether it's real in a simulation or whether it's real [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7863.139999999999s)]
*  in a carbon or there is there is no carbon reality. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7866.42s)]

*  Everything is a simulation. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7871.54s)]
*  I mean, if you really get down to like what atoms are, [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7872.54s)]
*  most of atoms are empty. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7875.46s)]
*  You know, it's just massive empty space that's very confusing. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7877.62s)]
*  And then when you get to subatomic particles that exist [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7881.7s)]
*  in different spaces at the exact same time [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7884.58s)]
*  and somehow another can be both in a superposition [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7887.78s)]

*  what is this thing that we're we're arguing about? [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7895.74s)]
*  Yeah. What is this life that we're living? [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7899.26s)]
*  You know, and you know, how much of this is how much of this is like [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7902.54s)]
*  concrete and real and how much of this is it just we're just like, [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7905.9s)]
*  you know, you're talking about childhood trauma and people that are fucked up. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7910.299999999999s)]
*  And most people, most people are a little fucked up [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7913.339999999999s)]
*  and they're just swimming through this world of possibilities [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7916.62s)]
*  and anxiety and not knowing what's and then you're being lied to [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7920.78s)]
*  by the people that are supposed to be there to take care of you. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7925.0599999999995s)]

*  They're concerned with. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7931.58s)]
*  I mean, from the moment they get into the White House, [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7933.14s)]
*  they're concerned with reelection. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7935.66s)]
*  They're concerned with. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7937.54s)]
*  I mean, this is what happens. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7938.54s)]
*  Donate, donate, donate. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7940.9s)]
*  We need money. We got to fight off this and that. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7942.38s)]
*  Donate to the Democratic Party. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7944.18s)]
*  I mean, this is this is, you know, when our founders kind of form [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7945.9s)]
*  these founding documents of the United States of America, [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7951.18s)]

*  you know, the Queen of England and these authoritarian leaders. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7959.9s)]

*  And you look at the Constitution, Bill of Rights, [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7974.46s)]
*  it's limited to saying what the government can't is not allowed to touch [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7976.42s)]
*  what they're not allowed to do. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7980.46s)]
*  You look at there's a reason for that, for us to to express [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7983.139999999999s)]
*  our individual sovereignty, to think for ourselves, to live our lives, [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7987.82s)]
*  to be able to truly live free. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7990.98s)]
*  And you look at, for example, what what actually happened [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7993.98s)]
*  after the the Lahaina fire blew through and destroyed [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=7998.0599999999995s)]
*  the entire historic town of Lahaina. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8002.86s)]
*  What happened? Government didn't show up at all. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8005.219999999999s)]
*  It was people helping people. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8008.62s)]
*  That was the most beautiful thing that rose up from this disaster. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8011.299999999999s)]
*  And we've seen it in other in other major disasters as well. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8015.54s)]
*  You know, in Hawaii, we call it the aloha spirit, that love, that care [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8019.34s)]
*  and that compassion that we as people have for each other, [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8022.74s)]
*  whether we are friends or family or total strangers, [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8025.3s)]
*  recognizing someone in need. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8028.54s)]
*  And even if you have nothing at all yourself, stepping up and saying, [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8030.14s)]
*  here, I'm here for you. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8034.86s)]
*  And and that's what we saw in an incredible way happening all across [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8037.3s)]
*  all across West Maui, Maui County, [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8042.9400000000005s)]
*  but but also the support and help and heart and prayers [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8045.54s)]
*  that was coming in from people all over the country and around the world. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8048.1s)]
*  When you when we when we talk about going back to the basics [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8051.82s)]
*  of limiting government's control, of limiting [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8055.02s)]
*  the responsibilities that that they have and instead [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8059.9s)]
*  allowing people to live and take care of each other. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8064.42s)]
*  I mean, this this has application. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8067.26s)]
*  In every respect, you talk about education, BJ, [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8068.74s)]
*  and how little choice parents actually have in being able to choose [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8071.179999999999s)]
*  what kind of education is best for their kids. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8076.139999999999s)]
*  Is it a home school? Is it a charter school? [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8078.3s)]
*  Is it a religious school? It's like, what what is it? [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8080.139999999999s)]
*  Parents in so many cases and increasingly so under the Biden administration [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8082.62s)]
*  are seeing their rights as parents to care for their kids in the best way [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8087.0599999999995s)]
*  that they know being taken away. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8091.46s)]
*  And school officials and education unions literally [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8093.94s)]
*  and the Biden administration literally saying that [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8097.74s)]
*  we we have the right to determine your child's education. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8101.82s)]
*  You as a parent do not. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8106.34s)]
*  Parents getting arrested by going to board of education meetings, [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8107.7s)]
*  having themselves be silent. Exactly. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8110.74s)]
*  That's what the parents getting arrested [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8112.66s)]
*  while they're going to these meetings is wild. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8115.0599999999995s)]
*  Not even BJ Penn got arrested. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8117.5s)]
*  But parents go into these meetings to complain about the education [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8122.139999999999s)]
*  their children are receiving and the propaganda the children are receiving. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8125.58s)]
*  And then them getting arrested and also and being labeled terrorists. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8129.14s)]
*  Yes. By by the federal government. Yeah. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8133.3s)]
*  That's insane. That's insane. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8137.78s)]
*  It's it's you know, did you not think that the parents are concerned? [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8139.86s)]
*  Do you not think that their concerns are valid? [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8143.9s)]
*  Like that's that's supposed to be open for debate. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8145.78s)]
*  And when when that debate gets said, then people get to decide, [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8147.98s)]
*  well, which side is right? [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8151.38s)]
*  But when you silence debate, all that tells me is you're scared to lose. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8152.58s)]
*  Yes. And you don't want to lose this. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8155.86s)]
*  But the question is, like, why? [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8157.5s)]
*  Why would the government not want people to be involved [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8160.0199999999995s)]
*  in the education of their children? [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8162.94s)]
*  I can see not my parents to be in not my parents, [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8164.74s)]
*  rather to be involved in the education. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8167.14s)]
*  You know, why would that doesn't be because they they want [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8168.54s)]
*  a generation of people to be raised who are conformists, not critical thinkers. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8173.22s)]
*  Yes. That's what it comes down to. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8178.86s)]
*  It is it is about exerting that control and making sure these little kids [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8181.299999999999s)]
*  from the very beginning know, hey, yeah, I'm on a tight leash. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8184.86s)]
*  And these are the boundaries. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8188.62s)]
*  And this is how I must live my life and operate under the authority [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8189.7s)]
*  of these people who have appointed themselves. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8193.58s)]
*  We don't need no education. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8196.14s)]
*  Boom. I love that. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8200.699999999999s)]
*  And when when do we when do we say enough is enough? [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8202.26s)]
*  I mean, they say they're going to put [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8206.66s)]
*  say Trump, they're going to put I think they're going to put Trump back in [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8210.22s)]
*  because I think that's why they're doing this whole pandemic. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8213.02s)]
*  So everybody's going to say, you know, that's a believable story. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8215.7s)]
*  And I and I hope Trump goes out there and says [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8219.5s)]
*  Johnson and Johnson, a Pfizer, Moderna, all you guys are going to prison. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8223.1s)]
*  You know, I did Warp Speed to help the people and you guys made a myocarditis [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8228.42s)]
*  shot for you to, you know, and I want to see, you know, something like that. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8231.86s)]
*  You think that they're going to let Trump get into office? [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8237.86s)]
*  I think that's why maybe they're doing this pandemic. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8240.460000000001s)]
*  I don't know. And I think that no one's buying it. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8243.02s)]
*  And then I think it's not it's not that, you know, it [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8245.34s)]
*  I think they are doing. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8248.74s)]
*  And by they, I mean, Dr. Evil. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8250.18s)]
*  Well, no, it's bigger than that. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8252.78s)]
*  It's bigger than that. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8254.66s)]
*  By they, I mean, the Democrat elite that have vast control. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8255.980000000001s)]
*  It's not just the present Biden or the Biden administration. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8261.82s)]
*  It's the media. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8264.7s)]
*  It's the politicized Department of Justice. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8265.62s)]
*  They are doing that. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8267.980000000001s)]
*  The timing of all of these charges against Trump is not an accident. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8269.5s)]
*  The fact that they want to hold multiple court hearings [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8275.66s)]
*  for these charges the day the day before Super Tuesday, [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8280.62s)]
*  which is a major turning point in any candidate's election, [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8286.18s)]
*  they want to kick off these [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8289.86s)]
*  court hearings the day before Super Tuesday. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8292.46s)]
*  It's not an accident. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8295.46s)]
*  This is all happening right now. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8296.3s)]
*  It's banana republic stuff. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8298.66s)]
*  It really is. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8300.3s)]
*  And that's what they're doing is, again, these [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8301.46s)]
*  these terrible things that are happening in our country are happening [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8304.699999999999s)]
*  because we have people in power who care more about themselves [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8307.699999999999s)]
*  and their power than they do about the people, [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8310.1s)]
*  this country, our constitution, our democracy. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8313.02s)]
*  They are setting this incredibly dangerous precedent [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8315.14s)]
*  that now, much like many banana republics in the world, [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8318.74s)]
*  whoever's in power has the ability to politicize and weaponize that power [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8322.58s)]
*  to go after their political opponent. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8328.18s)]
*  That's that's that's the real take away whatever people think about Trump [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8332.26s)]
*  or whatever the consequences and implications of what what is actually happening [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8335.66s)]
*  and what so many of the Democrat elite are justifying [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8340.46s)]
*  in the name of protecting democracy is actually destroying it. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8343.699999999999s)]
*  And when you look at the charges, like when he gets indicted, [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8347.460000000001s)]
*  where the day before there's a scandal, [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8352.22s)]
*  it's there's a chart of the revelations [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8355.42s)]
*  of Biden about Biden. Yeah. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8358.74s)]
*  And then day after Trump gets reigned. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8360.58s)]
*  You guys got some power gets indicted, right? [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8364.460000000001s)]
*  It's crazy. Yeah, it's crazy. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8366.86s)]
*  It's just the whole thing is just so. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8369.9s)]
*  So how much do we take? [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8372.54s)]
*  I mean, what what do we do? [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8374.18s)]
*  What can be done? [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8375.66s)]
*  What can be done? [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8377.06s)]
*  You know, I mean, I don't know at this point. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8378.699999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, it does. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8381.539999999999s)]
*  It starts with us. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8382.539999999999s)]
*  It starts with us as Americans taking our own responsibility seriously. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8385.06s)]
*  You know, in the in the Constitution and Bill of Rights, it talks about [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8392.779999999999s)]
*  our government exists with the consent of the governed. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8396.859999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's us. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8401.5s)]
*  There is no people. That's us. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8403.859999999999s)]
*  But these guys. Yeah. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8406.18s)]
*  Yeah. But then when you have things like the deep state, like they're there. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8407.42s)]
*  There's no question. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8410.699999999999s)]
*  There's no question that the the the these powerful entities are very real [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8411.58s)]
*  and they they want nothing more than to hold on to their power. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8416.619999999999s)]
*  But isn't it fascinating that that was not generally discussed before 2016? [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8420.34s)]
*  Before Trump got into office, that was not like a concern [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8425.22s)]
*  that people had, like the CIA or the FBI broke through. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8428.58s)]
*  Right. Right. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8432.42s)]
*  He's the I mean, you know, you look at what the FBI [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8433.62s)]
*  and what the government was doing during before that election even happened [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8436.74s)]
*  to try to take him off the field, to try to eliminate him [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8442.02s)]
*  from being a choice that voters could seriously consider. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8445.46s)]
*  You look at what the mainstream media, even Fox News did at that time [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8447.66s)]
*  to try to make it so people didn't take him seriously. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8451.02s)]
*  He's the guy that broke through. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8453.62s)]
*  And so what did they do every single day of his presidency? [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8455.38s)]
*  And now for years beyond, they're continuing to try [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8459.34s)]
*  to make sure that he is not allowed to carry out, [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8462.9s)]
*  you know, the things that he was talking about. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8468.46s)]
*  And he is the guy who's as you've talked about, he's the guy who talked [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8469.82s)]
*  very openly about the military industrial complex and their power [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8472.46s)]
*  and the deep state and these entities. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8476.14s)]
*  It's going to be really wild to see what happens in November. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8478.9s)]
*  I'm very nervous about it. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8481.38s)]
*  I'm very nervous about the country just as a whole. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8482.7s)]
*  I'm really worried that people are going to lose their fucking minds, [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8485.3s)]
*  you know, and that that's going to be the tipping point. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8488.14s)]
*  And then people are going to agree to even more stupid shit. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8490.42s)]
*  And then it just it seems they just want us to fight with each other all day long. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8492.94s)]
*  And that's and that's in the right to fight. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8499.14s)]
*  That's where so much of of what I'm dedicating my my time and energy to is, [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8501.02s)]
*  you know, using every platform I have available to [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8506.82s)]
*  talk about the fundamentals of who we are as a country, as Americans. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8510.539999999999s)]
*  What is it? What was what were the values and principles? [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8513.98s)]
*  This country was founded upon and we can have different ideas [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8515.94s)]
*  on political issues here and there. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8518.539999999999s)]
*  But if we're standing on a common ground of recognizing [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8520.78s)]
*  our fundamental rights and freedoms, that is a pathway forward [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8523.980000000001s)]
*  for us to make sure that we do all that we can to protect it, [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8528.66s)]
*  that we be critical thinkers, that we seek out the truth, that we speak the truth, [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8531.86s)]
*  that we're willing to to have conversations with people [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8535.86s)]
*  who we might disagree with and know that, hey, you know what? [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8539.42s)]
*  I still respect you. You're still my friend. Right. It's cool. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8541.78s)]
*  And and by doing so [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8544.900000000001s)]
*  and exercising our responsibility to vote for people [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8547.820000000002s)]
*  who actually care about the people versus more of these same politicians [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8552.820000000002s)]
*  who clearly only care about themselves and their own power. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8558.5s)]
*  We we can and must start to make that shift to save our country. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8562.62s)]
*  Tells you what what's in your future politically. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8567.7s)]
*  It's a good question. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8571.980000000001s)]
*  I have seen I have experienced [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8574.66s)]
*  of what the power elite and all of their propaganda arms are capable of [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8577.94s)]
*  and how they how they tanked my candidacy in in 2020. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8583.66s)]
*  If there were a viable path [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8592.66s)]
*  forward, I would take it. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8596.18s)]
*  There are different there are different possibilities that I'm looking at, but [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8600.42s)]
*  my my goal is to serve our country and my goal is to be in a position [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8604.300000000001s)]
*  to make the most positive impact to serve the American people in our country. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8608.1s)]
*  Beautiful. We need more people like you. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8612.78s)]
*  Yeah, we really do. We really. Yeah, there's not. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8615.42s)]
*  There's not a lot of people like you. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8617.980000000001s)]
*  And it's you you exposed the system in so many ways [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8619.74s)]
*  because you were everything that everybody claimed they were looking for. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8623.58s)]
*  On its face, right? [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8627.26s)]
*  All the superficial things. Everything. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8628.86s)]
*  Everything eloquent, a leader, a person who served [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8631.58s)]
*  Congresswoman, everything, everything. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8635.859999999999s)]
*  Impeccable record, everything. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8639.02s)]
*  And still they're like, not her. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8641.26s)]
*  No fucking way because I didn't do what they wanted. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8643.46s)]
*  There you go. I wouldn't be a puppet. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8646.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8648.38s)]

*  you got to look at BJ in his prime. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8664.06s)]
*  I say that all the time. Yep. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJomguV-tU&t=8666.06s)]
