# Joe Rogan Experience #1428 - Brian Greene
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [February 19, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wQsmAtZoc)
*  3, 2, 1. Brian Green, ladies and gentlemen. How are you, sir?
*  Good, thank you. How are you?
*  Thanks for doing this, man.
*  Oh, it's my pleasure.
*  I've enjoyed your work for many, many, many years. So, I really appreciate you coming in here.
*  Well, thank you. I appreciate that.
*  Like I was telling you, I just started your new book.
*  And how's it going?
*  It's going well. It hasn't confused the shit out of me yet, but I know it's coming.
*  It will be coming. No doubt. No doubt.
*  With all your work. So, the beginning of time, the beginning of the universe to the end,
*  that's essentially what you're summarizing.
*  Yeah, that's the backdrop to the entire narrative of the book. I basically want the reader to get
*  a feel for the whole thing. How it started, how things like you and me rise up, how consciousness
*  emerges, issues of free will and whether we have it, and then on to the future. What's going to
*  happen to us and the world and the universe as time elapses to the far, far future?
*  It's, I'm just getting to the part where you're talking about how entropy and evolution sort of
*  co-mingle to create life. And when you think of entropy, a lot of people think of something
*  dissolving into chaos.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  But that's not necessarily the case.
*  It's only part of the story. I mean, entropy kind of gets a bad rep, right? It's the thing
*  that you want to avoid, but somehow the laws of physics don't allow you to avoid it. It's
*  this disintegration, it's this decay, it's this drive toward disorder. And that's kind of true.
*  But the reality of the situation is more subtle because overall, entropy needs to go up. But that
*  doesn't mean there can't be little pockets of order that form along the way. And in fact,
*  the universe is incredibly clever. Stars, the ubiquitous feature of the heavens, they are
*  pockets of order that naturally form, but as they form, they increase the entropy in the
*  surroundings. So the net entropy goes up even though this beautiful, orderly, bright object
*  in the sky appears. And it's only because of the appearance of stars that the universe is an
*  interesting place. Without stars, the particles of the universe would just disperse, the universe
*  would get bigger and bigger, colder and colder, and that would be it. There wouldn't be any
*  structure in the universe if it wasn't for the force of gravity. Stars themselves, just the fact
*  that they exist is very strange that you have this thing, and ours is fairly small, right? It's a
*  million times larger than Earth, and it's going to burn for billions of years, and it's just hovering
*  there. And it creates all the life. Literary is responsible for all the life. And when they supernova,
*  that creates the actual ingredients for life, which is even more strange. You can't have
*  biological carbon-based life if it's not for a star exploding. Yeah, I mean, we often, in a poetic
*  way, say that we are made of star stuff. I guess that was Carl Sagan's, but you can also say that
*  we are made of nuclear refuse, right? We are the detritus that the death throes of a star
*  puts out into the universe, and it rains down on planets, and at least on one such planet,
*  that stuff comes together and yields life. So it is a cycle. I mean, I don't want to sound like
*  the Lion King here, but you know, that's really what it is. Well, what I'm so interested about
*  in getting into your book is the fact that you are sort of detailing all these steps that have to
*  take place in order for all this life, in order for this universe to be what it is, and then where
*  it's going to go. Yeah, exactly. And the remarkable thing, and sort of the main point at some level is
*  that, look, we're special entities. We can think, we can reflect, we have emotions, but ultimately,
*  you and I and everybody else, we're just bags of particles that are governed by physical law.
*  And so there's this continuity between the stuff of the world, the inanimate stuff of the world,
*  the inanimate stuff of the heavens, and us. We all come from the same fundamental ingredients and
*  the same fundamental laws. Now, some people find that that gives them, I don't know, a sense of
*  desperation, a sense that we're not special, a sense that somehow the universe is pointless
*  or meaningless. But you know, my view on this is it's spectacular that we're made of the same stuff
*  that makes up this bottle of water or any of the wonderful little statues you have on this desk,
*  because that means that how remarkable that collections of particles can do what we do.
*  And I think that's really the way of looking at the continuity. We don't need to be endowed
*  with some special quality by some external entity. You don't need that. Particles can do
*  miraculous things. And that is the message that I think you can draw from a more complete
*  understanding of where we came from and where we're going.
*  Pete Slauson That the fear of death and the attitude of the finite life being insignificant,
*  that like, what is the point? This sort of existential angst that many of us struggle with,
*  right? That's something that you touch upon really early on, that this thing that makes us unique is
*  that we know that we're going to die. Pete Slauson
*  Yeah, yeah. That to me is the vital distinguishing feature of our species. You know, we can
*  reflect on the past, we can think about the future and recognize that we're not going to be here
*  in the future, at least for some period of time. And it's an idea and it's powerful motivating
*  influences, one that has been explored throughout the ages. Otto Roeink, who was one of the early
*  disciples of Freud who ultimately broke with Freud, developed this thesis that our awareness
*  of our own mortality is one of the driving factors in what we do. And then when I was,
*  I don't know, I was in my 20s or 30s, I read a book by a guy named Ernest Becker called Denial
*  of Death. I don't know if you've ever heard of this book. It was big in the 70s and won actually
*  the Pulitzer Prize in the 70s. And it's a wonderful distillation of this way of thinking
*  about why we humans do what we do. And in many ways, in my own book, the one that's coming out
*  actually today, until the end of time, it's extending this notion that Becker developed
*  in Denial of Death, but now seeing it in a cosmological setting because it's not just
*  we that are going to die, it's every structure in the universe is going to disintegrate in time.
*  Our best theories suggest to us that even protons, the very heart of matter, there are quantum
*  processes that in the far future will ensure that every proton disintegrates, falls apart into its
*  constituent particles. And at that point, there's no complex matter around at all.
*  What timeline are we talking about here?
*  Well, pretty big, long timeline. In fact, I like to use a metaphor to try to give you a feel
*  for the times involved. I like to use the Empire State Building. And imagine that every floor of
*  the Empire State Building represents a duration 10 times that of the previous floor. So like on the
*  ground floor, it's like one year, first floor, 10 years, second floor, 100 and so forth. So you're
*  going exponentially far in time as you climb up the Empire State Building. And in that scheme of
*  things, everything from the Big Bang until today, you're about at the 10th floor, 10 to the 10 years,
*  10 billion years. And as you go forward, you are looking at things very far in the future.
*  And to answer your question, we think, and I underscore think, because we're now at the
*  speculative end of our theoretical ideas, protons will decay roughly and say by the 38th floor.
*  So 10 to the 38 years into the future.
*  So we can relax for a little bit.
*  You can relax for a little bit. But here's the thing. The amazing thing obviously is,
*  it sounds trite, but time is relative, right? So any duration that seems long, it's only long by
*  comparison to another duration. And on say the scale of the entire Empire State Building, up to
*  say 10 to the 100 years into the future, which is what the peak would represent, 10 to the 38 years
*  is like less than a blink of an eye. I mean, it's nothing on those scales. So you sort of have to be
*  careful with your intuition if you're willing to entertain the kind of fantastically long
*  time scales that you necessarily need to if you're going to think about the very far future.
*  Pete is there speculation as to what happens when protons do cease to exist?
*  Jared Yeah. We anticipate that all complex structure will fall apart. So if there are any
*  stars left over, we believe that by the 14th floor, most stars will have used up their nuclear fuel.
*  There'll be dark embers just sort of, you know, smoky out there in the cosmos. But if they're
*  still hovering around by the 38th floor, they will all just dissipate into their particulate ingredients.
*  So it's hard to imagine past say floor 38 that there's going to be any life or any mind or any
*  complex astronomical structures out there in the universe. So the window within which the universe,
*  as we know it, exists is kind of small when you think about it in terms of the entire cosmic timeline.
*  Pete So, impossible to understand the actual span of it because it is so long,
*  but yet so small, like in the human mind.
*  Jared Yeah. It's very hard to hold these durations in mind. I mean, I don't feel like I've been
*  thinking about this stuff for a long time. I don't feel like I have an intuition for the durations
*  that we are talking about. In fact, the Empire State Building, that little analogy helps me
*  to sort of give some relative sense of when things of interest will happen in the universe. But,
*  you know, we're good at understanding days, weeks, months, years, the times of, you know,
*  conventional experience. We have no basis for understanding the universe over these scales that
*  we've never experienced. You know, and that's true not only for time, it's also for space, right?
*  I mean, we have very good intuition about everyday phenomenon. I mean, if I was to take this bottle
*  of water and I throw it at you, you'd catch it. You know where to put your hand. You wouldn't have
*  to calculate its Newtonian trajectory to figure out where the water is going. But if I was to do
*  the same thing with electrons, you don't have, and neither do I, a quantum intuition about the
*  wave functions and the probabilities that govern how a particle like an electron behaves. And that's
*  simply because we were unfortunately or fortunately born as big creatures
*  relative to the scales of quantum mechanics. And because of that, our intuition was never
*  under any evolutionary pressure to understand how electrons behave. In fact, I like to say those of
*  our forebears wandering around the African savanna who started to think about electrons and quantum
*  mechanics, they got eaten, right? They're the ones whose genes didn't propagate onward. And therefore,
*  those of us who are the beneficiaries of the survival of our ancestors, we're good at
*  understanding Newtonian physics, but we're not good at understanding anything else about the deep
*  reality of the world.
*  Pete Slauson Do you anticipate that someday in the future, whatever is next after human beings will
*  be able to understand these concepts? Because if you stop and think about what a human is,
*  we've only really been this for X amount of 100,000 years.
*  John Ligato That's right. And it's a good question and it's a tough one. I like to imagine
*  that as we get ever better at creating virtual worlds, virtual reality or whatever augmented
*  reality, whatever version of that kind of technology takes us over in the far future,
*  we might be able to experience these distinct realms in such a powerful way that our innate
*  intuition may begin to shift, to change so that we grasp the quantum realm the way we grasp
*  Newtonian physics. I can at least imagine that as a possibility. What it would take to actually get
*  there and whether our species will ever last long enough to actually have that kind of an impact on
*  our intuition, I don't know. But it's all about experience and survival. We have been programmed
*  by evolution not to understand the true nature of the world. We've been programmed by evolution to
*  survive. And those are two radically different propositions because you don't need to know the
*  true nature of reality to survive. It's a distinct attribute and one that is not necessarily one that
*  has any survival value to understand black holes or the Big Bang or general relativity or quantum
*  mechanics or entropy or thermodynamics. These qualities we develop as we go forward and try
*  to understand the world, go beyond mere survival and figure out things that excite us. But it's
*  not something which obviously has any survival value. It may someday. It may. What's interesting
*  is also how relatively recently people have been pondering these ideas in a sort of a
*  quantifiable way where you can write things down and sort of express it with other scientists and
*  try to figure out who's right and who's wrong in terms of these calculations. But human beings,
*  when did we really start pondering the scope of the universe?
*  Pretty recently. I mean, if you think about the beginnings of modern physics, you can start with
*  Galileo, you can start with Newton, but in any event, we're talking on the order of hundreds
*  of years. And the amazing thing, in hundreds of years, we've gone from a complete lack of
*  understanding about how anything in the world actually works to the development of Newton's
*  equations where you can make fantastically accurate predictions about solar eclipses or
*  lunar eclipses or motions of the planets and so on. And then, you know, a couple hundred years
*  after that, we migrate from that understanding, which is basically an encapsulation of the patterns
*  that we can all discern with the naked eye. We develop a whole new body of physical law
*  called quantum mechanics, which is so completely counterintuitive, which describes the world in
*  terms of qualities that we don't ever see with the naked eye. But nevertheless, we can use the
*  math to make predictions, and the predictions are born out by experiment. And that progression
*  only took, say, a couple hundred years. And that's where we've gotten. So it's kind of spectacular
*  that, you know, we beings who are just coming of age here in the Milky Way galaxy can sit down with
*  a piece of paper and a calculation, a pencil, and we can figure out magnetic properties of
*  particles like electrons to 10 decimal places. That's shocking. I mean, it's stunning. And it's
*  something that I think all of us should be very proud of that our species has been able to accomplish
*  that. Some way or another, I don't think I'm responsible. I don't feel proud. I don't feel
*  like any of my people were involved. You've contributed your part. No, it really is a collective
*  effort. And that's the beauty of science. In the end of the day, it's not that most scientists are
*  ever going to be remembered. You stop someone in the street and ask them to name a scientist. Yeah,
*  they may say Hawking. They may say Einstein. That's kind of it, I think, for most people.
*  And I don't think that's a bad thing per se, because it's not about the personalities or the
*  people that have pushed the frontiers of understanding. It's the fact that we've got this body of insight
*  that continues to grow and continues to allow us to manipulate and understand the natural world.
*  And I think that's really what it's all about. Don't you think that there are some personalities
*  like yourself, like Feynman, like, I mean, Neil deGrasse Tyson, that because of their personality,
*  because they're sort of they're charismatic people, it actually makes more people intrigued
*  about these possibilities and makes more people attracted to the ideas? Yeah, no doubt. And I think
*  that's a vital point, because without that impetus from outside the traditional educational system,
*  I don't think we would have the kind of interest in science that I can feel growing, you know,
*  in the world around us. I mean, the unfortunate thing in the educational system is that we teach
*  toward examination. We teach toward assessment. And if you want to figure out how to flatten a
*  kid's interest in these ideas, just teach them stuff and tell them you're going to be tested on
*  this on Tuesday, you're going to have to spit out, you know, everything that you've learned.
*  So I find it kind of heartbreaking, the way in which so much intrinsic interest in these ideas,
*  you can see it a five or six year old, right? I mean, I like to say we begin as little scientists,
*  we're exploring the world, we're trying to figure things out. And then we go into the educational
*  system. And it's not by malice, it's just by the nature of how we teach in the current,
*  you know, approach to educational philosophy, that so many kids wind up seeing these ideas as a burden.
*  So I don't want to have to spend time learning about parts of the sale or how to balance
*  reactions. I see with my own kids, I've got a 15 year old son, a 12 year old daughter.
*  And all they are motivated by is next Wednesday's quiz. And I'm like, hey, these ideas,
*  they're kind of exciting. They're kind of wonderful. Like, no, no, dad, dad, dad,
*  I just want to know enough so I can, you know, do well on the quiz. And once the quiz is over,
*  they just sort of leave the ideas behind.
*  When did these ideas become attractive to you?
*  Well, I was, I don't know, not unusual for a scientist, but unusual, I think, in the spectrum
*  of kids in the world, because at five or six years old, I was just captivated by mathematics.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Five or six?
*  Definitely. Yeah. My dad, my dad was not an academic. My dad was a composer. He was a vaudevillian.
*  He was a comedian. You know, he was in the early days would go around the country and
*  with a harmonica group and a stage show that that's what he did. You know, he liked to say
*  that he was an S.P.H.D. a Seward Park High School dropout, you know, so at 10th grade,
*  he just hit the road. But he loved scientific ideas. So he taught me the basics of arithmetic
*  when I was about five years old. And then I would ask him to set me problems. And he'd give me these
*  30 digit numbers by 30 digit numbers. I'd write them out on big construction paper. And I'd
*  spend the weekend just calculating away on these huge, you know, arithmetical problems of no
*  interest to anybody on planet Earth. But to me, the fact that you could learn a little
*  piece of math and then do something that nobody had ever done before, that was exciting to me
*  as a kid. And that's really what got me going.
*  So you chose the right path, clearly.
*  Yeah, you know.
*  Your personality, whatever it is that attracted you to those ideas.
*  Well, you always wonder about that. I don't know if you wonder, you know, I always wonder,
*  how can you not? What would have happened if X would have transpired instead of Y?
*  In fact, I have to say, when I graduated college, I had sort of a period of, I don't know,
*  depression is too strong a word for it, but a period of what have I done? I went to college,
*  I could have studied all the great ideas of the world. And all I did was get a technical education
*  where I could solve Schrodinger's equation and solve Einstein's equations. And I felt like,
*  wow, have I just like squandered the greatest educational opportunity that one could have ever
*  had because I was so completely focused on just trying to understand physics and mathematics.
*  How did you get past that?
*  Well, I was lucky. I was given a second chance. I won a scholarship to go to England, to Oxford,
*  and ostensibly it was to study physics. But when I got there, I realized that I was completely
*  free to do whatever I wanted to do at that point. And so I took a year to study literature.
*  I went to the physics classes, so I was sort of showing up, but I wasn't focused on it at all.
*  And instead I was focused, I got a, you know, in England, it's a tutorial system. So I got a
*  tutor, which is somebody at the college that sets you assignments and you write papers.
*  You literally go in and you read your paper out loud. It's not something where you just turn it
*  in and it gets graded. So it's a very personal experience. You write something and you're actually
*  delivering it to this individual that is going to help you in your educational journey.
*  And so that's what I did for a year. And at the end of that year, I kind of said to myself,
*  okay, I've got it. I understand now what it would mean to study these other subjects.
*  And I sort of felt like I'll be able to do this on my own if I continue to be excited about it.
*  And I went back to physics with a vengeance. And basically in that second year, completed my
*  doctorate in that year and moved on from there. So this time that you took off this year, well,
*  you didn't really take it off, but you changed paths. Yeah, it changed paths. How beneficial was
*  that for you? Do you think that it helped you sort of appreciate what your original subject of
*  interest was as well? Yeah, hugely so because, you know, it's funny, it's the flip side of something
*  I often encounter with people that are interested in science but don't know the math. And they always
*  say, or some say, I'm never really going to understand this body of science because I don't
*  know the mathematics. And I try to convince them, look, at some level that's true. If you really
*  want to do research in the general theory of relativity, you've got to learn differential
*  geometry and all the tensor calculus. But if you are really interested in the ideas, you really can
*  grasp the ideas without the technical background. So I try to demystify something that can seem
*  impenetrable because you haven't entered the field. And I think the same thing happened to me in
*  reverse for the more humanistic explorations. It had this aura of grandeur that I was unable to
*  penetrate because I'd never really immersed myself in the ideas. And by spending a year
*  in those ideas, it didn't diminish them in any way, but I felt like it brought it back down to
*  earth as another journey toward truth, another pathway toward insight, and one that you don't
*  have to have a degree in. You don't have to know the ins and outs of the academic version of that
*  subject to understand it and grasp it and spend some time thinking about it. So do you think that
*  for people studying anything, particularly those studying science and mathematics,
*  very rigid disciplines, do you think that they all could benefit from sort of expanding their
*  education into philosophy or art or something that uses your mind in a different way?
*  BD Yeah, some. There are some people in the physics and mathematics community who
*  are so intensely focused that it would almost be a shame to pull their attention away from the deep
*  dive that they're going to do for the rest of their lives and the contributions that they're
*  going to make and have made are substantial and exciting. But I think for many others,
*  and certainly for me, I mean, look, I, as most people do, but not all, but I learned early on
*  that I'm not going to be an Albert Einstein. You know, I can make contributions and I have
*  had contributions to fails like string theory and cosmology, but they're never going to be at the
*  level of shattering our understanding of the world, things that people are going to talk about 500
*  years from now. That's unlikely. And I think for somebody like that, who's able to make contributions,
*  but pulling away from the technical work is not going to extract some vital insight into the nature
*  of the world that otherwise wouldn't be discovered. I think there is great value in doing exactly what
*  you're saying because by broadening your perspective on what the work you're doing is actually
*  revealing, it's part of the human quest for understanding and seeing it as an isolated
*  discipline where it's all about the next equation and the better unified theory or the deeper
*  understanding of the big bang. To see that as isolated from the human quest for understanding,
*  I think diminishes the work that we as physicists actually do.
*  Pete Slauson Was that a part of your initial ambition?
*  John Larkin Yeah, it was.
*  Pete Slauson To leave something that would just rock the world?
*  John Larkin Yeah, well, to go back to the comment that you made before about we being the only
*  species that knows that we're going to die, I think part of that instills in many people,
*  and certainly I see it in my own life, even though at the time that I was making various decisions,
*  I wasn't literally thinking about these kinds of issues of mortality, but how do you deal with that
*  recognition of the impermanence of your own life? Well, I think part of it is a symbolic kind of
*  immortality. You create something that will last. You create something that will have such impact
*  that it will stick around for a long, long period of time. So, I think yes. I mean, part of my
*  motivation in doing physics was not merely to get the next decimal place in this or that physical
*  quantity described in the natural world. It was to try to have some kind of insight that would rock
*  our understanding of the world and have reverberations that would echo out for many, many years to come.
*  That's interesting. Did that torture you somewhat? I mean, is that something that haunted you? Was it
*  in your head all the time? Not really.
*  But an ultimate ambition? But an ultimate ambition, yeah, for sure. And, you know, look,
*  I think when you're doing any work whatsoever, the day-to-day, the moment-to-moment is a grind.
*  I don't know how you find it in the work that you're doing, but if I'm working on a research
*  project, even if in principle the ideas are grand and wonderful and bold, the moment-to-moment
*  is calculating a way. It's trying to figure out that equation. It's putting an equation on a
*  computer. I mean, it is not sexy. It is not something that has that glorious quality that
*  you might ultimately describe when you're finished and you look back and you think about the
*  implications of your work. The moment-to-moment of almost anything that you do is a grind.
*  So I think that's ultimately what is the driver of whatever you're doing in your life,
*  the moment-to-moment. But yeah, there was certainly a part of me that would have a desire,
*  a hope that the work would reverberate in a powerful way. I think that's true for most
*  physicists, that notion that you can sort of sit at a table and think and change the way we
*  understand reality, the way Einstein did, the way Schrodinger did, the way Niels Bohr did.
*  But like what percentage of people have that revelation?
*  Yeah, I think it's pretty few and far between.
*  And everybody else is sort of just contributing.
*  Contributing.
*  And then occasionally someone, some light bulb goes off.
*  Just sort of powerful new insight and you're like, okay, everything has suddenly changed.
*  That's so exciting though.
*  And it's what keeps you going. It's what keeps you going.
*  To be the person who has the light bulb.
*  Yeah, but I tell my students, and especially young students who come in and are still trying
*  to figure out what they want to do, if you're not satisfied with just contributing, if you're
*  not satisfied with being part of the journey but not the person at the head of the breakthroughs,
*  it's probably not the field for you because it's so unlikely, because it's not just brainpower.
*  It's thinking of the right questions. It's thinking of things in the right orientation.
*  It's being at the right place at the right time with the right DNA that somehow is attuned to
*  the question that's being asked. So it's not even fully under your control.
*  It's not sort of a matter of exercising your mind and building up the muscles of the brain
*  in such a way that you are the strongest person to contribute to this and this idea.
*  It's luck. It's timing. It's being there when the question's being asked and you happen to see the
*  way forward.
*  Pete Slauson That's, it's so interesting to me that there's so many people working on all this
*  stuff and the average person that doesn't contemplate quantum physics or any of these
*  equations, we have no idea what's going on.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson And that this, all this work that's so critical to our understanding of what the
*  universe really is, the very fiber of the universe itself, all this is going on and most people are
*  just sort of, they're reaping the residual benefits of it but they're just wandering around not knowing.
*  John Sussman Yeah, hugely so. In fact, there's a number that's quoted that quantum mechanics is
*  responsible for something like 35% of the gross national product. So, it's like, it's in a very
*  concrete way. Now, the problem with that number is I recently looked it up to find the source of it,
*  so I sort of went online and checked it out and apparently, I'm the source of this number.
*  Pete Slauson And I assure you that I've not done a calculation that really fully justifies this.
*  But roughly speaking, you know, anything that has an integrated circuit is the result,
*  beneficiary of quantum insights. So, we use this stuff every moment of our technological lives
*  and yet, as you say, for the most part, most of us don't have a deep understanding of the reality
*  that's responsible for the gadgetry that the science has given rise to.
*  And it's a strange, quantum mechanics is an utterly strange reality.
*  John Sussman Too strange. I've tried many, many times to try to understand whether it's Sean
*  Carroll's books or yours or anyone's. It doesn't get in.
*  Pete Slauson Right. And again, it goes back to, you know,
*  our brains just weren't under pressure to think quantum mechanically. But I assure you, you give
*  me a couple hours. I mean, books are one thing because it's a one-sided conversation. But you
*  give me a couple hours and a back and forth and I will absolutely get you to a place where you
*  appreciate and have a sense of what these ideas really are telling us about the nature of the
*  world. John Sussman Here's the thing that I've always
*  wanted to ask someone like you. What do you think was happening before the Big Bang?
*  Yeah. It's a deep question and a subtle one. And there's sort of two ways that I'd like to
*  think about that question. One is it could be that the Big Bang was an interesting event,
*  but not the first event in the totality of reality. It could have been the first event
*  that sparked the expansion of our part of space. But it could be that there's a grander realm of
*  space within which we sit as a small part and that grander realm may have been there for a far
*  longer period of time. It may have experienced its own Big Bangs, maybe a collection of Big Bangs
*  that may extend infinitely far into the past. So it could be that the answer to the question of
*  what happened before the Big Bang is a lot of other Big Bangs or a lot of other quantum events
*  that were taking place in a larger landscape of reality than we have direct access to.
*  However, another answer is that the very question may not make as much sense as the words seem to
*  suggest. We know how to parse that sentence. We know what it means to talk about the moment
*  before the Big Bang because we know how to talk about the moment before your birth or the moment
*  before the Civil War or the moment before any event that happened in the world. We fully understand
*  the meaning of that kind of sentence. But it could be that when it comes to the Big Bang,
*  the sentence actually doesn't mean anything. It could be that the Big Bang was the place where
*  time itself started. And Hawking himself had a wonderful analogy to get this across. He said,
*  look, I'll dress it up a little bit. Imagine you're walking on planet earth and you pass by some and
*  you say, hey, can you point me in the direction of north? I want to walk in the northward direction.
*  They point you, continue to walk you, pass by somebody else. Say, hey, which way is further
*  north? And they point you in that direction. But when you get to the north pole and talk to somebody
*  there and say, hey, how do I go further north? They look at you and say, whoa, that question
*  doesn't mean anything because this is where north begins. There's no notion of going further north
*  than the north pole. And it could be that that spatial metaphor applies to time. Talk about a
*  billion years ago or 10 billion years ago. But if you go to 13.8 billion years ago, the Big Bang,
*  that may be where time started. And you can't go further back in time than the very origin of time
*  itself. That freaks me out. Yeah. See, that's one that gets in your head. What do you mean beginning
*  of time? Yeah. Why would time have a beginning? Good. And it could be the time is an emergent
*  quality of reality. I give you an analogy, boy, what I mean by that is we all know what temperature
*  means intuitively. Something's hot, you feel it. Something's cold, you feel it. Your body understands
*  those concepts. What physics has done is it's gone deeper into the concept of temperature and
*  revealed that it is nothing but the average motion of the particles making up the environment.
*  So if the molecules are moving really quickly, you've got a hot environment. If the molecules
*  are really moving slowly, it's a cold environment. So temperature emerges from the motion of
*  particles. So if you have like one particle, you can't really talk about it being hot or cold
*  because you need a conglomerate. You need an agglomeration of particles to be able to talk
*  about their average motion. And in that sense, temperature is this emergent idea that rests upon
*  more fundamental ideas, the molecules and atoms that make up reality. Maybe that's true of time.
*  Maybe time as we know it is a property that only makes sense in certain environments when there's
*  enough stuff arranged in the right patterns. But fundamentally, maybe there are atoms or molecules
*  of time, which when not arranged in the form that we are familiar with, don't yield time as we know
*  it. Time itself may be a quality of the world that exists here in this environment, but doesn't even
*  apply in other environments that are configured radically differently. Whoa. That's a heavy one.
*  Yeah. That's a heavy one. What also is a heavy one is what caused the Big Bang?
*  Why would something smaller than the head of a pin become everything that we see in the cosmos?
*  Yeah. So there are ideas for the answer to that question. Look, all of this is tentative because
*  it's very hard to do measurements that go all the way back to the beginning. We have astronomical
*  observations that we need to be sure are compatible with the predictions of our theories and so forth.
*  So we as good scientists do what needs to be done to try to test these ideas. But the idea that I
*  think most physicists or cosmologists buy into at the moment is that gravity can have two
*  manifestations. The usual form of gravity that you and I know about is the attractive version.
*  You drop something toward the earth and it moves downward because the earth and the object pull on
*  each other. That's the ordinary gravity that we experience every day of our lives. But Einstein's
*  equations actually allow gravity to also be repulsive. It can push outward as opposed to
*  just pulling inward. And this is something that we have never experienced because the gravity
*  created by a rocky object like the earth is always the attractive variety. The gravity created by the
*  sun, again, a compact object is always the attractive variety. But Einstein's math shows
*  that if you don't have a rocky object that's isolated in space but rather energy that is
*  uniformly spread through a region of space, that that kind of entity yields repulsive gravity.
*  Why is that important to your question? If the very early universe, that little
*  tiny head of a pin that you're talking about, if it was filled with a uniform bath of this energy,
*  we call it the inflaton field, the name doesn't matter, but if it was filled with that energy,
*  it would have been subject to repulsive gravity. What does repulsive gravity do? Pushes everything
*  apart, causes everything to rush outward. So the bang of the big bang may have been a spark of
*  repulsive gravity operating with a tiny region of space that pushed everything apart. And this
*  concept of repulsive gravity is just theoretical? Have we observed any sort of element in the
*  universe that- It is theoretical, but it's at a level of understanding that I think most physicists
*  would say causes it to migrate into the camp of established understanding of how gravity works.
*  So number one, Einstein's equations have now been tested over and over again in a whole variety of
*  circumstances. The detection of gravitational waves just a couple of years ago is like the
*  crowning triumph of Einstein's math. A hundred years ago, the math says there should be ripples
*  in the fabric of space. A hundred years later, we finally detect ripples in the fabric of space.
*  So we are very comfortable with any prediction that comes out of Einstein's mathematics. And
*  right in the mathematics is the prediction of what I was just describing. You've got uniform
*  energy in a region, repulsive gravity. The other thing is we currently witness that the expansion
*  of the universe is speeding up, not slowing down. Since the 1920s, everybody thought that, yes,
*  the universe is expanding, but it will slow down over time. Why? Because gravity pulls things back
*  together. You throw an apple upward, it doesn't go up faster and faster. It goes up slower and
*  slower because the earth's gravity pulls it back. Everybody thought that would apply to the universe
*  as a whole. It's expanding, but expanding ever slower. The observations in 1998 culminated in
*  1998, which won the 2011 Nobel Prize showed that the distant galaxies are moving away
*  ever more quickly. The expansion of space is speeding up over time. It's accelerating.
*  How do we explain that? The best explanation we currently have is repulsive gravity. We believe
*  even today, the universe is suffused with a bath of energy. We call it dark energy. We believe it's
*  uniformly going through space. I like to think of it almost like a Turkish sauna. It's like the
*  steam filling the sauna, this energy filling space. That repulsive gravity, we believe,
*  is responsible for the observations that the distant galaxies are rushing away faster and
*  faster over time. It's circumstantial, but the case for repulsive gravity is quite strong.
*  What would have caused it to co-alert? What would have caused it to compress initially?
*  Why would all that matter be in this tiny, less than a pin-sized object?
*  So, I have no idea, and nobody else on planet Earth has any real idea other, but we do have theories.
*  One of the theories suggests that in the very early universe, it was a highly chaotic environment,
*  very hot with all the fields fluctuating widely up and down. The idea would be that if you wait
*  long enough, where it's hard to know what weight means in this environment, but don't press me on
*  my definition of time back then, just sort of intuitively, if you wait long enough, on rare
*  occasions, the energy will just happen to flatten out in a region, become uniform, and then that
*  region explosively inflates, grows large. So, imagine you're looking at a pot of boiling water.
*  The surface is, of course, widely undulating up and down, but if you wait long enough, very long
*  time since you've never seen it, neither have I, there will be a little patch on the surface of that
*  boiling water that flattens out. Why? That only means that the water molecules happen for an instant
*  to be moving in just the right way to keep that little patch of water from wildly bubbling.
*  It will happen. It's rare, but if you wait long enough, it will occur. Similarly, the widely
*  undulating fields in the early universe, if you wait long enough, a patch will flatten out. You
*  get the uniform energy, plug it into Einstein's equations, that region explosively inflates, and
*  I mean explosively. It can go from a size that's much less than an atomic diameter to larger than
*  the observable universe in far less than a blink of an eye, in 10 to the minus 30, 10 to the minus 35
*  seconds. That's how powerful repulsive gravity can be. That is so baffling. Yeah. So before that,
*  before this happens, you just have, in this theory, you just have all of this energy
*  sort of randomly interacting with other energy in the universe with no physical objects. Yep,
*  yep. And that could have been forever. That could, and in fact, that's the main point. There's nobody
*  who is hanging around looking at their watch saying, good God, when is this big bang going
*  to finally happen? You know, so you can have this cosmological pre-show. You can have it last as long
*  as you like. The only thing that you need to happen is that sooner or later, a region flattens out,
*  and then the cosmological show begins. And if we're looking at this model of the universe being
*  this infinite universes with different characteristics and different qualities to them,
*  this could be happening throughout infinity all over the place. Yeah. And in fact, this so-called
*  inflationate cosmology is the technical name for the subject, says that. It says that it's quite
*  likely that this explosive inflation of the region that we currently inhabit, it was just one of many
*  such events. And therefore, there are other far-flung regions throughout this larger
*  cosmological landscape where things have also inflated, but the details can be different.
*  The physical details can differ from what we are familiar with. And the differences can be small,
*  temperature differences in one part of space versus another, or they can be far more significant.
*  Even the particles that make up that other realm may be different from the particles that make up
*  our realm. Their masses can be different, their charges can be different, their fundamental
*  physical features can be different. So out there in that wider cosmological landscape,
*  it can be the wild, wild west of realities. And they don't have to worry about proton deterioration?
*  There may be realms in which they don't have to worry about protons falling apart. The wild,
*  the really crazy idea is that if you're very careful mathematically in analyzing these theories,
*  you realize that there have to be realms out there that duplicate ours as well. Many can be
*  different, but there have to be versions of this reality that are also instantiated, occur out there
*  in other realms. So you come to these crazy sounding, sci-fi sounding ideas that you and I
*  are having this conversation out there in other distant realms.
*  And infinite number of times.
*  Perhaps infinite number of times. And moreover, small differences can also arise in these other
*  realms where maybe our positions are interchanged at the table, or maybe your name is Joe Green and
*  I'm Brian Rogan, or there's like strange realities that can be taking place. And this is not an
*  overworked theorist imagination. This is the careful, dispassionate analysis of the mathematical
*  equations. Now, I should say there are some physicists who see this implication and say,
*  whoa, you guys have fallen off the deep end. Your theory has imploded because any theory that
*  predicts that kind of a wealth of realities that are kind of untestable because they're so far away
*  that we will never interact with them. That's the kind of theory that we have been trained to avoid,
*  to excise. However, the more forward thinking I'd like to describe us physicists say, hey,
*  math has proven to be a very valuable guide over the course of hundreds of years.
*  And if this is where the math is taking us, it's at least worthy of our attention to investigate
*  it fully and possibly come to the conclusion that this is how reality actually behaves.
*  Pete Slauson Jesus. That's the weirdest one. The weirdest one. It's like when people talk
*  about intelligent life somewhere in the universe, that you're out there. Or a version of you or
*  infinite versions of you. Jared Slauson
*  Yeah. And it can be disturbing. Like, what do you mean by you if there are many of you's out there,
*  each of whom has an equal claim on being you because they've had the same experiences,
*  they have the same memories. Pete Slauson
*  And maybe have made infinite variations in the decisions that you've made through your life.
*  Jared Slauson That's right.
*  So, you could meet a Brian Greene your age somewhere out there in the universe that's
*  gone left. Or the wrong ones.
*  Pete Slauson Right. Exactly.
*  Jared Slauson Become a gambling addict.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, you know, it's like a Star Trek episode
*  where you've got like Spock and Evil Spock, you know, the one that had the little beard on.
*  Jared Slauson Right.
*  Pete Slauson So, there's going to be a little bearded
*  version of me, a goatee out there. So, yeah. And the thing I want to stress is, this sounds kooky.
*  Jared Slauson Yeah.
*  And the danger of kooky sounding ideas in physics is that there are people who then jump off for it
*  and say, well, if that's possible, then this is possible. Maybe I can, with my mind, you know,
*  affect what other people are, you know. So, there's all sorts of crazy ideas that can be inspired by
*  the weird insights of modern physics. And you've really got to keep straight what's real and what's
*  ridiculous. Jared Slauson
*  That's a problem, right? When people start using, especially if they're articulate,
*  they start using scientific lingo to describe things that are very unscientific,
*  sort of like What the Bleep. Pete Slauson
*  Yeah. Well, caught.
*  Jared Slauson Yeah.
*  But that was one of those movies where a lot of people, like, there was all this quantum talk and,
*  you know, Dr. Quantum was in it with a little cartoon, particles and waves and, you know,
*  like, there's science behind this. But then, at the end of it, really, it was something that was
*  created by someone who runs a cult, who believes they're channeling someone who's like a thousand
*  year old alien, like, that whole Ramtha thing. Pete Slauson
*  Yeah. Well, let me tell you, if you have a moment.
*  Jared Slauson Please.
*  Pete Slauson So, a couple years ago, I was in the middle of a big project. In fact, I described this
*  toward the end of the book, so you'll get to this little anecdote if you choose to carry on reading.
*  I was in the middle of a big project and a speaking opportunity came in and I didn't properly
*  vet it. You know, the money looked good and looked like a fine thing and I signed off on it.
*  And then, a few days before I'm going, I realize it's to go to talk to Judy Zebra Knight, who
*  channels Ramtha, the 35,000 year old Lemurian sage. And I said to, you know, the folks who
*  should have been checking in on this, like the lecture agent, I can't go. And they're like, hey,
*  Brian, it's tomorrow. It's too late to back out. You know, it's like, Jesus Christ. You know,
*  so I look at some videos online and I see her on like the Merv Griffin show, where, you know,
*  she channels Ramtha on live television. I don't know what year this was. You know, she snaps her
*  head forward and goes back. She changes her voice. It becomes like something between the queen and
*  Yoda. You know, it's a really weird place. Which is, oh, you know, hello being. And she's talking
*  to Merv Griffin, you know, and he's talking about like an airplane. She goes, what is airplane?
*  You know, it's that kind of thing. Anyway, so I go, you know, and I show up. And the first thing
*  I see is there are all these people walking around a grassy field with their arms out like this. And
*  I'm like, can they see? And I get closer, they're all blindfolded. And I'm saying that what is going
*  on here? And they describe that each person has a card around their neck where they've written down
*  their life's dream. And an exact copy of that card has been put out on this big field. And they have
*  to feel their way toward the matching card. And if they succeed, this shows that this goal or desire
*  is going to come to pass. Oh, boy. You know what I'm saying to those guys? Like, so how's it going?
*  He goes like, really good. You know, one person found their card, you know, in the last few months,
*  like, you know, the odds of probability of that happening are kind of not unreasonable, but that's
*  all that this is. And then they take me to the blindfolded archers. Oh, Jesus. Yeah. You know,
*  so they're taking bow and arrow, and they're firing at these targets. And like, man, I'm like,
*  standing way back on this kind of thing. And they asked me, you know, do you want to try it?
*  And I was like, you know, there's a photographer that's come along. I'm like, no, I'll avoid that.
*  And then they introduce him to this woman who is able to predict the next card in a shuffle deck.
*  And, you know, so she'd pull out these cards, and she'd say, okay, it's going to be seven of clubs.
*  And it's like a three of spades. And then the next one is a seven of diamonds. And she goes,
*  oh, well, there's the seven that I was talking about, you know, one card before. You know,
*  so it's this crazy circumstance where, and then I go to give my talk, okay, because that's why I was
*  there after all. This was just like the preamble. They were showing me what they do. I walk into
*  this barn, and I cross the threshold of the barn, and they all give me a standing ovation.
*  And I'm like, okay, appreciated, but like, why are you giving me a standing ovation?
*  And I go in and I start to give my talk, and I say to them straight out,
*  what I've seen here is nuts. Okay? You know, I say, you know, if you're going to try to predict next
*  cards in the deck, you know, one out of every four times, you'll get the suit. One out of 13 times,
*  you get the rank. There's nothing in there but the pure probabilistic laws of mathematics, you know.
*  They rise up and give me a standing ovation. And I say, it's appreciated, but why are you applauding?
*  I'm telling you that you're wasting your time. And they applaud me again. And I'm like, this is like
*  so totally weird. But then I go to the book signing. I finish my talk at the book signing,
*  and these people, they come up to me and they talk real softly and say, there's a lot of crazy stuff
*  that's happening in this place. But we come here because we feel that there's something else that
*  in the world, and we want to be around like-minded individuals that are searching for the deeper
*  truth. So thank you for calling out the silliness that's happening here, but we'll come here anyway
*  and spend our money because we want to be part of the journey. And I have to tell you, I had a degree
*  of sympathy for them because I get the motivation. I mean, as a physicist, what we do is we are
*  revealing strange features of the world. So I get the urge, I get the desire that the problem is
*  that the methodology that's being employed is something that will never take you closer to the
*  truth. However much you may feel that you're among like-minded individuals. So I get the motivation.
*  I get the sensation. I get the urge. But it's tragic that these individuals feel that this kind
*  of an undertaking is the pathway that will take them toward the deeper truth. And let me just
*  finish up. So after this, they take me to the dinner. And the dinner's in a mansion at the
*  top of the hill, and that's where Judy is. I'm probably going to get sued for this conversation
*  by the way. I don't know. But I've never spoken about that.
*  Rampel wouldn't sue you.
*  Yeah, well, they're quite litigious.
*  Are they really?
*  No, they definitely are. So anyway, this is just a one person's opinion. They take me to the mansion
*  at the top of the hill, and that's where she is. She doesn't come down and actually participate in
*  the talk. She's like watching it on closed circuit television up in the mansion.
*  Oh boy.
*  And I walk in and she hugs me. But it was too goddamn long of a hug. You know what I'm saying?
*  It was like, and she was like, thank you. It was like this big emotional thing. And I was like,
*  I don't get it. But I think that's the way that she brings people in to the fold and gets them to
*  spend the big bucks to enter on this so-called journey toward truth where she's channeling this
*  made up fictitious sage that somehow people buy into.
*  Is this all still going on?
*  It was just a couple of years ago, so I imagine it is.
*  I imagine if she's really channeling it. We're just missing.
*  That's right. That would certainly rewrite every rule of reality, every law of physics
*  that I understand.
*  I mean, wouldn't that be less weird than the Big Bang itself?
*  No, I tell you why. I tell you why. See, when it comes to the Big Bang, I can sit down with
*  the mathematics that I understand well, and I can follow the deductive chain of reasoning that gets
*  us to some of these strange implications that we're talking about, multiple Big Bangs, other
*  realities, and so forth. When it comes to channeling a 35,000 year old sage, I don't know what the hell
*  that even means. I don't understand the physical processes by which that could possibly happen.
*  I don't understand how there could have been a being of the sort that she's channeling alive
*  35,000 years ago because it doesn't have any agreement with the archaeological record.
*  There's a vital distinction between weirdness that emerges from careful mathematical analysis
*  and weirdness that emerges from an overworked imagination that possibly sees a business model
*  whereby a lot of money can be brought in if you can get people to buy into your vision of how
*  the world works. Well, it's sort of like what they do is they curate ideas and then they run them
*  through their sort of filter of woo woo. Yeah, exactly. And then they distribute it in a very
*  palatable way that attracts people. That movie, I tell a story, I've told this before, so I apologize
*  to people who've heard it. There was a friend of mine at the comedy store, had a friend that I don't
*  know her name, but she came to the comedy store and she was so happy. And she was like, I'm so
*  happy. I go, why are you so happy? She goes, because I found the secret. And now that I know
*  about the secret, I am going to be married. I am going to be this. I'm going to have this fulfilled
*  life. I'm going to reach my dreams. And I'm really excited about that. So at the time I had just
*  seen the movie and then I was just starting to understand the criticism of the movie. I was
*  reading all these accounts where scientists were breaking down all the things that were wrong.
*  And I didn't dash her dreams. I just was like, wow, okay. And then I saw her a year later,
*  outside of another one of my shows at a different comedy club. And I said, hey, how are you doing?
*  She's like, things are just not going the way I thought. I thought because of the secret that
*  everything would be great, but my dad is still a pain in the ass and you know, he's moved in with
*  me, doesn't have any money and I can't establish a good relationship and I don't have the job that
*  I wanted. I don't understand because I've been using the secret. I think about it every day.
*  Pete Slauson Right.
*  Jared Slauson And I said, here's my take on this. If you talk to someone who's very successful
*  and you say to them, hey, how did you get very successful? And they say, I thought about it all
*  the time. I have a vision board. I took that photo of the house that I wanted. I put it in the vision
*  board. That became my house. I took, you know, this idea, I want a beautiful wife, I want a family,
*  I want sports cars and this and that. And now I have those things because the mind is a powerful
*  tool and the mind can create reality. You're just talking to someone who is successful. How many
*  people thought like that and nothing happened? I bet millions. I bet there's so many. You have
*  a bias in successful users. Those are the ones you're talking to. And just because of the fact
*  that they've been able to have these extraordinarily successful lives while visualizing these things
*  does not mean that visualizing these things creates an extraordinarily successful life.
*  You have to think and you have to act and you have to do and there's trial and error and there's a
*  lot of lessons to be learned. But if you wanted to simplify it at the end, once you're successful
*  and boil it down to a philosophy that you could sell a course on, that's what it would be.
*  Yeah, no, that's exactly right. Look, there's nothing wrong with visualizing success. But that
*  is not the causal ingredient that will yield the success. And the thing that comes to mind is,
*  you know, I don't know if they do it any longer, but there was certainly a time when Olympic athletes
*  would be taught to visualize, say, jumping over that high bar, you know, and they'd run through
*  the whole thing. But that's not all that they were doing. They were doing, you know,
*  10 hours a day of training that integrated this visualization as part of the training program.
*  So it's kind of tragic when people buy into these crazy ideas. And I have to tell you,
*  when they were making that film, they called me to be in it. And I think it was the director,
*  one of the producers I was on the phone with, and, you know, they were describing what they were
*  doing. And I probed sufficiently hard, and some of my friends did not probe sufficiently hard,
*  nor in the film, and regretted it. But I probed sufficiently hard, and I said,
*  look, what you're doing to me sounds really dangerous. It sounds like a really bad thing
*  to be doing. And they took offense in that call back then. A year after the film came out,
*  it was either the director or producer, I can't remember the gentleman's name, called me up,
*  and said, I want to apologize to you. You are absolutely right. I have finally realized what a
*  bad film this was to be involved in, and I completely regret it. So that, I don't think,
*  is the point of view of, you know, the Romp, the School of Enlightenment, which is behind this,
*  or at least part of what was behind this, but at least the director or the producer, whoever it was,
*  saw the light and realized that this is not the kind of information that you want to put out in
*  the world because it can change people's lives in a very negative way.
*  You know, I think your comparison to Olympic athletes is very good because the Olympic athletes
*  are visualizing something that they already do. You know, there's a great benefit in visualizing,
*  for athletics, for martial arts, for a lot of different things, visualizing success,
*  visualizing potential problems, failures of your process, how you're going to adjust on the fly.
*  All those things are great because then when things do take place in real life situations,
*  you've already prepared for them. You know the path. That's what that's all about.
*  Jared Sussman I agree with that. And in fact, I have to tell you, you know, in one of the chapters,
*  later chapters of the book, I describe theories about why it is that we, for instance,
*  tell fictional stories. I mean, could there be any evolutionary value in two individuals
*  telling each other a story that they both know is false, that they know has no connection to the
*  world around them, but yet we've been doing that since the emergence of language?
*  Pete Slauson Right.
*  Jared Sussman And there are these interesting evolutionary scenarios in which what you're
*  saying is brought to bear in that unfamiliar context. We tell stories because it's the mind's
*  way of rehearsing for the real world, but it's a way of rehearsing for the real world that's
*  completely safe. So, you can go on all sorts of crazy journeys to the underworld, up into the
*  clouds, you can engage in all sorts of battles, you can fight gods or demigods. All these things
*  can take place within your imagination, so you're completely safe. And yet, when you encounter
*  something that's analogous to the stories that you've been told or retold or embellished or
*  told to others through other accounts, your brain is more attuned to respond in a beneficial way
*  because it's not as novel as it would have been had you not been engaged in this fictional
*  account of telling stories. So, there's value in visualizing. There's value in telling stories,
*  but it's not the causal part that some individuals would want us to believe it is.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah. The only thing that I would say,
*  contrary to that, is some people develop expectations based on fictional accounts.
*  Jared Sussman Yeah.
*  Pete Sussman And there's a real problem like romantic movies, where some people will expect
*  behavior that exists in these romantic movies only.
*  Jared Sussman Right.
*  Pete Sussman And it's not indicative of human beings in the real world.
*  Jared Sussman Yeah, yeah. Point well taken. I mean, I think the vital thing is that your brain
*  has had sufficient experience that it can weight these fictional accounts in a way that can enhance
*  your response to the world but not set undue expectations of things that are just, you know,
*  only going to be true in a fictional setting and not in the real world.
*  Pete Sussman It's just so strange to me that we desire those. I mean,
*  hero movies, right? Like, hero movies in particular, especially superhero movies.
*  Someone who possesses powers beyond anything known to human beings or any life form.
*  Jared Sussman Yeah. I get that.
*  Pete Sussman Yeah.
*  Jared Sussman I mean, the way –
*  Pete Sussman Sure. You would love to just snap your fingers and fix everything.
*  But I actually see it in a slightly different way relevant to what we were talking about before.
*  You know, I think that the whole hero worship that we have as a culture comes again from our
*  recognition of how powerless we are against the forces of nature, against the inevitable death
*  that is facing us all. And therefore, there's something deeply seductive about the possibility
*  of a being that can transcend the limitations that we mere mortals are always subject to.
*  Pete Sussman Yeah.
*  Jared Sussman So, I think it's built into our DNA to respond to the way that we do,
*  in the manner that we do when encountering a hero in the world. I mean, there's, you know,
*  Joseph Campbell.
*  Pete Sussman Yeah, I was just going to bring him up.
*  Jared Sussman Yeah. So, you know, in the power of myth,
*  but his more technical version, the hero with a thousand faces, you know, he goes through
*  the whole notion of what it is to have a myth. And it's basically an individual that's called
*  to action to rise above the kinds of activities that mere mortals will be able to undertake,
*  resist the call at first, but then rises to the challenge, goes out into the world,
*  conquers, comes back a changed individual and shakes up the reality from which that
*  individual initially emerged on this journey. And there is ample evidence that across cultures
*  throughout the ages, we have constantly been telling these kinds of mythological tales because
*  they speak to us. They speak to our urge and our desire to transcend the limitations that our
*  physical form and the laws of physics necessarily constrain us to.
*  Pete Sussman Yeah, it is fascinating when you think of how many different languages and how
*  many different cultures share those same archetypal themes.
*  Yeah, yeah. And I do think it all comes, if you look way back into the history of the ideas,
*  it comes from this initial recognition that we are mortal. And the fact that our brains are able to
*  not just fix on the moment, but can think about the entire timeline is the one that makes that a
*  poignant realization. And if we couldn't think about the future, what would it matter if we knew
*  that we were going to die? I mean, it would mean nothing. But the fact that we can innovate and
*  the fact that we have ingenuity that allows us to, you know, make the wheel, that allows us to build
*  the pyramids, that allows us to come up with quantum mechanics and Einstein's equations and
*  Beethoven's symphony and Picasso's work, the fact that we can undertake all of these expressions of
*  creative will and the desire to transcend the world around us has a downside. And the downside
*  is we recognize that we are not going to be here for very long. And I think that motivates a certain
*  kind of engagement with the world and hero worship is part of it.
*  Kurzweil is a fascinating character.
*  He thinks he's going to be around forever.
*  Yeah, that's why I was bringing him up. Have you discussed any of this stuff with him?
*  You know, I don't know him personally. I have certainly gone to some of his talks and I think
*  he and I had one exchange at some point in the past. And I totally get where he's coming from.
*  You know, he feels that we're perhaps the final mortal generation. And how sad it is
*  after, you know, 100,000 generations of humans, if we could only stick around for one more
*  generation, science would come to a point where we would be immortal. And that feels like a tragic
*  state of affairs. I don't think he's right. And I think most people who think about this deeply
*  don't think he's right either. However many vitamins you take and however much science is
*  progressing, the notion that we are just a generation or two from immortality, I think,
*  is wishful thinking.
*  This is a strange concept of immortality too, because it's not necessarily you. It's a downloaded
*  version of you that will exist in some sort of a computer, which is, what does that mean?
*  Right.
*  Like, that sounds like hell.
*  Yeah, it could be.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I-
*  How's REM sleep in that computer?
*  Well, I allow for the possibility that maybe it would be a way of being in the world that
*  would have upsides that are hard for us as flesh and blood individuals to appreciate at this point.
*  Um, but it raises the deep question, would that be a good thing? In fact, if you had that opportunity
*  to be downloaded in some form, and that would allow you to hold on to all your memories,
*  build new memories on top of them, have experiences, maybe there's an avatar that
*  you're able to drive through, you know, your mental machinations is out there in the world,
*  would you do it?
*  I might have said yes before I've had some pretty profound psychedelic experiences,
*  and then from then I've said, I'm gonna hedge my bets. I'm gonna see what's next.
*  Right.
*  I'm gonna see what happens when the lights go out.
*  Oh, really? So you think there may be something that happens when the lights go out?
*  I don't know. I don't know what, I mean, for sure, your body's going to decay,
*  and you are going to become a part of the earth. You're becoming part, unless they cremate you,
*  or unless they embalm you with some toxic chemicals, and then nothing can use your dead
*  tissue, which is really a shame. It's really a shame that we do that, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, unless someone murders you and you have to exhume you in the past to solve,
*  in the future, whether to solve a murder. But I don't know what, what do you think
*  consciousness is? Do you think consciousness is clearly just a factor of brain tissue and
*  an energy? Or do you think it's possible that what our brain is, is something that
*  tunes into consciousness?
*  Yeah. Well, I've spent some time thinking about this question. I think it's perhaps the deepest
*  question that faces science or even humanity at some level. And my own personal perspective
*  is that consciousness is nothing more than the choreographed motion of particles in various
*  quantum states inside a gloppy gray structure that sits inside this thing that we call a head.
*  Do I have any proof for that? No. Does anybody have any proof for what consciousness is? Not
*  at all at this moment. But the history of the reductionist program, where we've been able to
*  take some of the more spectacular creations that have emerged in the world and recognize that they
*  are nothing but the product of their ingredients in the laws of physics, leads me to extrapolate
*  that idea to the experience of consciousness. Now, having said that, there's a deep puzzle.
*  It's called the hard problem of consciousness, which is if electrons and quarks and particles
*  and laws of physics are all that there is, and if you buy into the fact that electrons don't
*  have an inner world, that quarks don't have an inner world, how can it be that by taking a
*  collection of those particles, you can turn on the lights? How can a collection of mindless,
*  thoughtless particles somehow yield mindful experience? And that's a deep question that
*  science has not yet answered. My own feeling is when we understand the brain better,
*  that question will evaporate. We'll look at the brain with our newfound understanding,
*  maybe it's a hundred years in the making, maybe a thousand years in the making, and we'll say,
*  aha, when electrons and quarks and protons move in this particular configuration,
*  one of the byproducts is an inner sensation that we call conscious experience. And that, to me,
*  is the likely answer that we will find. But there are some very smart, well-respected people who go
*  in a very different direction. There are some who say electrons and protons and quarks, they do have
*  a fundamental proto-conscious quality. They themselves are conscious beings of a sort.
*  Now, it's not like you're going to have electrons that are crying or quarks that are anguishing,
*  but if you have a little proto-element of conscious experience that is imbued into a particle,
*  and then you take a lot of the particles and put them together, the idea is that yields the
*  manifest conscious experience that we're familiar with. I don't buy into that, but there are people
*  who do. Why do you pick a position? Well, I take a position on this because I guess my view is,
*  you look out at the world, and what you do as a physicist is you move the smallest degree
*  required to explain the phenomena that you are observing. And to move from our current understanding
*  of the world to leapfrog to a place where electrons are conscious and quarks are conscious,
*  to me, is such a fantastically radical move that I don't consider it justified to make that move
*  with our current level of understanding. There was a time back in the 1800s when life itself was so
*  mystical that people basically said the same kind of thing. How could a collection of lifeless
*  particles ever come together and yield a living being? They said that they can't. You have to
*  induce a life force, you have to inject vitally, you have to inject a life force, and that's what
*  sparks the emergence of life on lifeless particles. I don't think any serious scientist
*  thinks that today. I think most serious scientists say, yes, life is wonderful, life is in some sense
*  miraculous, but life is nothing but the particles of nature coming together to yield the complex
*  molecules of DNA and RNA, the complex cellular structures, the cells come together to yield the
*  more complex multicellular organisms, and that's all that it takes to have something that's alive.
*  No life force is necessary. That way of thinking about the world has gone away, and my own feeling
*  is that that kind of progression is going to happen for consciousness. Today it's utterly mysterious
*  how it is that I have this inner voice talking inside my head, how it is that I look around the
*  world and I can see the color red and I can experience the color red. I don't just have
*  sensors that can call that red. I mean, an iPhone can do that. I actually have an inner world where
*  I feel that color red. Where does that come from? Hard to answer that question, but I think a hundred
*  or a thousand years from now we'll look back and smile at how we in this era invested consciousness
*  with such mystical quality when in the end it's nothing but particles and the laws of physics and
*  that's all there is to it. Well, what's interesting too to me is that as a human being,
*  my thoughts on consciousness are very deep and profound and this idea like what is this thing,
*  but if I really break it down objectively and animals have some sort of a consciousness,
*  I mean including they have instincts, right? They try to get away from danger, they try to survive
*  and procreate and we developed something far more complex in our ability to express ourselves in
*  language and in doing that language or during that creation of that language, we developed all
*  sorts of bizarre concepts and we've developed all sorts of different ways to describe feelings and
*  emotions and contemplate the future as well and these things are continually getting more and more
*  complex. If you go to single celled organisms, work your way up to early hominids and then get
*  to human beings, you just see this ever increasing form of complexity in every way and in the way
*  that the things see the world, of course it makes sense that there would be more complexity,
*  but we don't think about that when we think of a parakeet. We don't think of a parakeet as being
*  conscious, but a parakeet relatively speaking is far more primitive than a chimpanzee which is
*  relatively speaking far more primitive than a human being and it's just going to continue to evolve
*  or if we survive, things will continue to improve due to natural selection and random mutation and
*  all the other factors and will be something that makes this today look like the way we look at
*  single celled organisms or chimps or whatever. Yeah, I can well imagine that. I mean because
*  we see you know small changes in DNA, you know tiny fraction of percent yields a radical change
*  in what the being that has that DNA is able to accomplish, but at the same time you made reference
*  to psychedelic experiences and I trust you agree, but tell me if you don't, that those psychedelic
*  experiences were generated by a slight change in the chemical makeup of the particles coursing
*  through your brain and your body. Sometimes not even a change, sometimes a lot of them,
*  the heavier ones are actually produced by the brain. Right, so to me that's a great piece of data
*  that speaks to the fact that all it is is particles and chemicals coursing through a structure
*  because if the mind was somehow external to the physical makeup and the law is describing it,
*  then how would the injection say of some kind of foreign substance or as you say the brain producing
*  some sort of substance that it didn't ordinarily have within its makeup, why would that be able to
*  have such a radical impact on conscious experience? The way I would look at it if I was trying to
*  argue against that would be that your eyes and the organs of the human eye are taking in light
*  and through that light are able to perceive physical objects in the world that they would
*  not be able to do without light. It's something that allows you to see and it allows you to take
*  in depth perception and understand shapes that the human mind and particularly these glands that
*  produce these psychedelic chemicals, when experiencing these chemicals it allows the
*  brain to experience things that might be there all the time, but that you cannot perceive with
*  normal human neurochemistry. It needs to be enhanced or the levels need to be changed and
*  shifted and what's really perplexing about these chemicals is that these chemicals are produced by
*  your brain and if you do take these, like particularly dimethyltryptamine is the most
*  potent of all the psychedelic chemicals, if you take that you have these insanely profound visions
*  which leads to a lot of people having these religious spiritual epiphanies. Have you done
*  anything? Have you done any psychedelic experiences that you're allowed to talk about?
*  Yeah, I have. Not many and I'm a complete lightweight in this arena because I hardly drink,
*  you know, I hardly do anything that puts foreign substances into the body, but yeah, I was in
*  Amsterdam. I was there because I was giving a lecture to the Queen of Holland and I gave the
*  lecture and my wife and I were both there and after that was over we decided to do a little
*  experimenting and for somebody like me who doesn't experiment, I made a mistake because-
*  Did you eat it?
*  Well, the first night we went out and we went to one of these coffee bars and I guess I can
*  speak about this. You know, I-
*  It's legal here.
*  Yeah, totally legal, exactly. You know, we took the easy way in, like the novice version
*  and it did nothing to me at all that first night. So the next night when we went, I went right to
*  the bottom of the list where it was in Dutch or something, but it had like machine guns,
*  you know, pointed at a brain kind of thing. So I did that version and it was the most terrifying
*  experience of my fucking life. I didn't even say that either, but we were in a club,
*  we were in a club and all of a sudden the world changed and what started happening is
*  my brain started manufacturing versions of myself that would converse with me and convince me that
*  the reality that I was experiencing was real and then that version of me would destroy that reality
*  and the process would start over and over and over again.
*  Is this something you smoked or you ate?
*  Smoked.
*  Yeah, wow.
*  Definitely smoked. And again, I suspect that the impact was because my body has no experience.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  You know, and so I think that just enhanced the impact and, you know, it was terrifying.
*  I was in the hotel room and I was clinging to the bed and I actually said to my wife,
*  tie me up. Not in any, it sounds wrong. I mean, I mean, time it because I'm like terrified of
*  what I'm going to do. You know?
*  Wow.
*  You know? And so instead, you know, she called the doctor and I was like, she was like afraid
*  this would be like in the newspaper because I just like give a lecture to the queen, you know?
*  But, you know, they're so used to Americans getting in over their head with this kind of
*  experience. So it was something that they were completely used to. So, you know, they sent up a
*  doctor and the doctor basically just gives you sugar. And my wife knew that this was an extreme
*  circumstance for me because I don't eat any sugar, but I was like, he said, eat as much. I was like
*  taking the Milky Way bars.
*  So sugar is somehow another counteraction.
*  Sugar is somehow, I don't know, I don't know the chemistry behind this, but sugar is the antidote.
*  Caffeine is supposed to help as well.
*  Caffeine can help too, yeah, I guess. But it lasted eight hours. Even flying home on the plane
*  the next day, all I did is I sat in my seat and I put on the headphones and there was a Beatles
*  channel and I just like listened to Beatles for like seven hours and I was just, you know,
*  in this place that I had never experienced before. Now, you know, for our conversation, you know,
*  this just made it so intuitively obvious to me that my conscious awareness is totally dependent
*  on a few chemicals. That's all that's happening inside of the head. So in a way,
*  it was a valuable experience. It's not something that I want to ever experience again,
*  absolutely. But it was something that helped align my intuitive understanding of what
*  consciousness is with the scientific recognition that it all relies upon the stuff that's
*  circulating inside of your mind.
*  Yeah, what's interesting about these heavy-duty psychedelic experiences, because what you took
*  was by most people's idea very mild, but the more profound psychedelic chemicals that are also
*  produced by your brain, if you just shift that ratio, and not by too much really, you're not
*  talking about even, you're talking about little small doses of this stuff. Shift that ratio,
*  it produces these profound visions.
*  It's just like ayahuasca type stuff?
*  Ayahuasca is just an orally active version of dimethyltryptamine. They figured out how to,
*  your brain, your gut rather produces monoamine oxidase and it breaks down dimethyltryptamine.
*  And so they figured out how to combine an MAO inhibitor with the leaves of another plant that
*  has the dimethyltryptamine. But you could take it, there's synthetic versions of it. But the
*  point is, this is something that your brain produces, your liver produces. We know it's
*  produced in the lungs. The body makes it. But it's in there, but then if you shift the balance,
*  and all of a sudden you have these incredibly profound visions. It makes you think, what we
*  have now in terms of our balance and our chemicals must be different than what this fella must have
*  had, this chimpanzee thing. And primates before that, as the human, when you think of human
*  evolution, do you ever stop to think, what are we going to be like a million years from now if we
*  do survive? Have you ever done this sort of thought experiment where you say, okay, if things keep
*  going the same way, we used to be very strong and very hairy and we're getting progressively softer
*  as we don't need to use our bodies as much, our brains are getting larger, our heads are getting
*  bigger. Do you do that sort of thought experiment to see what we're going to be coming?
*  Not in a systematic scientific way because the process is so fraught with incredible detail that
*  I think it's hard for anybody, even experts in evolutionary biology, to really tell us anything
*  that will hold water that's really predictive. But on a general level, yeah, I mean, because
*  people often wonder, why is it that we haven't been visited by aliens, right? This is the thing
*  that comes up whenever you're talking about other life inside the universe.
*  I'm going to get to that in a minute.
*  Yeah, yeah, but the answer to that could be quite straightforward. Nobody out there cares about us
*  because we're so ill-developed, we're so young on the cosmic scene that there's nothing interesting
*  for them to find here on planet Earth. So to me, there's a natural explanation for why there can
*  be stuff out of their life out there and yet they don't hang out around planet Earth just the way we
*  don't hang around an anthill to try to have a conversation with what's going on inside
*  that particular structure.
*  I buy that argument the least.
*  You do? Really? Okay.
*  Because we're interested in butterflies. Butterflies are so boring. We're interested
*  in moles, we're interested in squirrels.
*  But interested in, we're interested in them for very specific reasons, right?
*  Sure.
*  So typically we're interested either because we want to see the evolutionary development that
*  yields this particular life form or because there's a general curiosity about how this
*  object is put together. If these other beings are so far beyond us that those kinds of taxonomy
*  questions are no longer of any interest, then hanging around here may not hold anything for
*  them to make the journey and stick around long enough for us to notice.
*  I don't buy that again for two reasons. One, because why would we assume that they're so
*  far beyond us that they wouldn't be interested in these talking monkeys with thermonuclear
*  weapons who dominate an entire planet? That would be fascinating. We found some planet
*  somewhere where people are, the politicians all lie to themselves, everyone gets video
*  through the sky, they fly in metal tubes that hurl over the oceans, they pollute the oceans
*  and eat all the fish. These people are fucking crazy. We've got to go there and check this out.
*  But imagine that this civilization, the notion of lording over a planet is like us talking about
*  the ant lording over a grain of sand. So they may be galactic as opposed to planetary in their
*  hegemony and the notion of some little tiny rock orbiting some nondescript star in the suburbs of
*  this completely ordinary galaxy off there on the side may not have the kind of pull that you
*  imagine that it does. Oh, I disagree. We think it's interesting when we see a chimp use a rock to
*  open up a nut. We think it's interesting that there's an amazing photograph of an orangutan
*  that's spearfishing. Have you ever seen it? I have seen that actually. Yeah, right. No, it is. He
*  learned it from people apparently, but it's still interesting nonetheless. Right. But I don't think
*  a hundred years from now we're going to be as interested in these kind of qualities or a
*  thousand years from now or 10,000 years from now. Well, why would we assume that these things that
*  come here from another planet are more than 10,000 years advanced? Well, that's a very good question.
*  And I think the answer to that is we look at the history of the cosmos until today and it's say,
*  let's just call it our universe to be concrete, 13.8 billion years. And we look at life on planet
*  Earth and it's a handful of billions of years old. So in a handful of billions of years,
*  you can go from some complex molecules to human beings. I like how you say it like it's not that
*  long. It's not that long because, you know, imagine that life began a few billion years earlier
*  in some other system, you know, stars and galaxies, they were starting up, you know,
*  a billion years after the big bang. So it could be that life in other worlds has a head start on us
*  by a few billion years. And we know what can happen in a few billion years. It can take us
*  from single cell to us. Sure. And you can imagine from a few billion years from now into the future,
*  it could be radically different. So to say it's 10,000 years ahead of us, that to me would be the
*  unexplained coincidence. How unlikely that they started and we started within 10,000 years in the
*  span of billions of years. That seems unlikely to me.
*  Does it seem unlikely when you're talking about the infinite size of the universe and there's
*  perhaps an infinite number of Brian Greens out there talking to an infinite numbers of me.
*  Good point. So you're absolutely right. We're almost guaranteed if the spatial
*  expansion of the universe is infinitely large, that there are going to be places where it's
*  within 10,000 years. But those are going to be a very small number compared to the places where
*  it's not 10,000 years. Is that true or would it be an infinite number of them? Not a small number at
*  all. But they're different kinds of infinities. So you mean in the space of the exact scope of
*  the universe itself, a small number relatively speaking to where we are physically. Yeah. So I
*  would say slightly differently. I'd say look at a finite size ball in this large spatial expansion.
*  So everything is finite now. So let's get a five billion light year ball.
*  Right. And within that ball, the number that are differing from us by 10,000 years will be very,
*  very small compared to the number differing from us by say a billion years or a couple of billion
*  years. So then- Simply by the law of numbers, if we imagine that the random processes that are
*  now there could be some physical principle that prevents life from emerging before say
*  four billion years ago. And if that's the case, and we're not aware of that principle,
*  then you'd be absolutely right. That we'd all be roughly at the same starting point and there's no
*  reason to suspect that they would be so far ahead of us. But I don't know of any such principle.
*  Pete Slauson But yeah, you almost have a reductionist view of this, right? Like
*  you'd, so if you had a guess, if you had $100 to bet, has alien life ever observed us? You would
*  say no. Jeff Snell Well, by observed, you mean could they just turn a big telescope in our
*  direction and gather some radio waves, you know? But yes, I would take that bet because frankly,
*  we've only been generating radio waves for the last, you know, 70 years. So it's only a 70 light
*  year ball around us and within that small radius, very unlikely that there's been some alien world
*  that's examining us. Pete Slauson So, it would have to be something that would be able to
*  recognize our signal and visit us. But don't we look at observable planets and solar systems and
*  discover Goldilocks planets? Jeff Snell We do.
*  Pete Slauson And we examine those planets from
*  vast distances away. Jeff Snell Yes.
*  Pete Slauson And wouldn't you assume that a life form that is perhaps thousands of years more
*  advanced than us with the exponential increase in technology, I mean, if they ever got to the point
*  where we are, that they would see these Goldilocks planets as well and recognize that Earth is one
*  of them? Jeff Snell Yes. However, if they are so far away, they're going to be examining Earth as
*  it was hundreds of thousands or millions or billions of years ago. So, if you truly want them to be
*  examining us in the sense of human presence on planet Earth, then it's a much more difficult
*  proposition to imagine that they've actually been doing that. Pete Slauson Is it possible there's
*  another way to examine things where you're not hampered by the speed of light?
*  Jeff Snell Not that I know of. I mean, any signal in the world that we're aware of is restricted by
*  the speed of travel, which is – now look, there's quantum entanglement, which is a strange property
*  of the quantum world in which distant objects can behave as if they are one and in some sense,
*  respond instantaneously to an influence in one location at a distant location no matter how far
*  apart they are. But that isn't really observing. That's more realizing correlations between
*  physical properties at widely separated locations, but I'm not aware of a means of leveraging that
*  to actually observe what's happening in some distant location, even if you do have quantum
*  entangled particles. Pete Slauson For a long time, my operating theory on aliens was when I see
*  something that's interesting, then I'm going to pay attention to it. Jeff Snell Right.
*  Because it just, it's too attractive. And it's part of the thing of whether it's rampha or any
*  of these wonky things, there's something about woo-woo stuff, whether it's psychics or channelers,
*  that's really attractive to people in some sort of a weird way. And so is, so are aliens. The idea
*  that if we were visited by something from another world, some far advanced space daddy or whatever
*  it is, that comes down here and is going to show us the way. That's so attractive that I think it
*  messes with your ordinary ability to observe and to objectively analyze what's real and what's not.
*  Jared Suellentrop Yeah, I totally agree with that. And I think it's an unfortunate feature
*  of the human mind that we tend to look outward for weirdness that will inject into the world
*  more than the everyday that we experience through common everyday encounters. We want there to be
*  more. We don't want it to be that we're just on this rock around this planet and we live for a
*  while and then we're gone. We want it to be more than that. And so we imagine that there's some
*  answer floating out there in the cosmos, that maybe that will be brought down to Earth through
*  our space daddy, as you referred to it. And my view of that is, it's much more noble to recognize
*  that there is no answer floating out there in space. There's no space daddy that's going to
*  come here and say, this is what it's all about. The answer is, you and I and everybody else,
*  we manufacture our own meaning, we manufacture our own purpose. And how much better is it that we come
*  up with our own meaning than having it bestowed or forced upon us by some external entity?
*  Jared Suellentrop Yeah.
*  Jared Suellentrop I don't think that diminishes things. I think it aggrandizes them because it's
*  coming ultimately from ourselves.
*  Pete Slauson That makes a lot of sense. I think the hope is that space daddy is going to prevent
*  nuclear war and figure out how to fix the ocean.
*  Jared Suellentrop Yeah, sure. No, I mean, and that I could certainly imagine happening.
*  Pete Slauson That's some technology.
*  Jared Suellentrop There's knowledge out there in the world that you could imagine that we haven't
*  yet encountered, that we could make use of. So, fantastic. But the other thing that's worth
*  keeping in mind, and this I think is surprising to some people, you can do a calculation as to
*  whether consciousness can itself persist indefinitely in the universe. You can ask yourself,
*  sure, Earth may go away, you and I, we're going to go away, we recognize all this, but is it
*  possible that some kind of conscious being can continue to cogitate indefinitely far into the
*  future or its progeny continue to cogitate? And you can pretty much establish that thought itself
*  will come to an end in this universe. Thought itself is a limited lifetime phenomenon in the
*  cosmos.
*  Pete Slauson So, when at least our universe, right?
*  Jared Suellentrop Yeah, so I'm going to focus just on our universe.
*  Pete Slauson So, the breakdown of protons when we get to that point, there's no room for thought to
*  exist.
*  Jared Suellentrop No, that's part of it, but I'm willing to go further. I'm willing to imagine
*  that even with the breakdown of protons, that there's some way that the particles that it spawns
*  electrons, neutrinos, photons, whatever, somehow through some configuration of widely separated
*  particles is able to have signals going back and forth that allows this group of particles to think.
*  I'm willing to posit that in order to be as general as possible. And with that assumption,
*  you can still prove that the relentless rise in entropy that we were talking about before
*  ensures that any cogitating being that happens to still be able to persist in this unusual realm
*  of particles will ultimately burn up in the entropic waste generated by its own process of
*  thinking. So, the process of thought itself in the far future will generate too much heat
*  for that being to be able to release that heat to the environment and to avoid burning up in
*  its own waste. When you think, you will fry.
*  Pete Slauson Dude.
*  Pete Slauson It's always been interesting to me when I've really stepped back and looked at it
*  that our ideas of the importance of thought are so egocentric. When we take into consideration
*  the vast scope of the universe and how majestic, so much of what we see in the cosmos that there's
*  no thought, at least as far as we know, whatsoever. Like hypernovas, like, you know,
*  star nurseries, all these different things that we see in the cosmos that are
*  infinitely larger than us and responsible for life itself.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson That these processes create the very elements that are needed to create life,
*  but we're so concerned with this one animal's ability to think and ponder and create and
*  emotions and write stories and to us, it is so egocentric because it is everything.
*  Jared Sussman How ridiculously self-centered.
*  Pete Slauson When you think about the infinite universe,
*  we are two finite beings sitting in the valley, you know, in front of a wooden desk.
*  Jared Sussman Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson It's really weird that we think about it as so important. It's everything to us.
*  Jared Sussman It is, it is. And it's hard to not think in those terms, but I encourage people,
*  and part of the point of this book is to encourage people to think in a cosmic way and recognize the
*  point that you're making, which are with these little tiny finite beings crawling around on this
*  planet. We're here for a brief moment of cosmic time and that's all there is to it. And some will
*  feel like, oh my god, that's disturbing, that's distressing. My point is, hey, extol, celebrate
*  the fact that you are here for this brief. I mean, think about the collection of quantum events
*  stretching back from the Big Bang until today that had to turn out exactly as they did for you
*  and for me to actually exist. Each one of these quantum events, and there are nearly infinitely
*  many of them, could have turned out that way instead of this, yielding a universe in which
*  neither you nor I nor anybody else would be here. And yet, against those astounding odds,
*  astounding odds, we're here. That is cause for celebration and you can go further. Not only are
*  we here, we can figure out how we got here. We can create art, we can write the stories that you are
*  referring to. We can create comedy, we can build monuments, we can create films, we can do things
*  that inanimate objects can't. So this, to me, is where the value and purpose and meaning comes from
*  as opposed to trying to look out and hope Space Daddy comes with the answer of, you know, flashing
*  a neon sign saying, aha, that's what it's all about. That's never going to happen.
*  It isn't, well, it might. You might have to eat your words.
*  I admit that it's possible. So every time I say it's not going to happen, I mean,
*  unlikely that it's going to happen.
*  Very unlikely, yeah. I agree with that. But it's interesting to me that that's the thing
*  that we look forward to the most. To the average person, if they think about space,
*  they think about intelligent life. That is far more interesting to them than the fact that there's
*  black holes out there that are devouring planets. They're sucking stars into its event horizon.
*  This infinite point of density that we can't even really begin to imagine with our own little brains.
*  Yeah, yeah. And the fact that all this arose without a guiding intelligence.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, that there are black holes and there are active galactic nuclei and there are black
*  holes slamming into each other, creating gravitational waves that we can actually detect. I mean,
*  it is a wonderfully rich reality that we are fortunate to be part of.
*  Do you experience much pushback or much conflict from religious people who don't like the fact that
*  you describe things in that way that didn't need an intelligent force or intelligent creator to
*  exist?
*  It's an interesting question because the biological community, people like Richard Dawkins
*  and the like, I think have really borne the brunt of the religious pushback because they're
*  dealing directly with phenomena of life and that's the precious commodity that somehow we
*  want to be sacred and therefore our religious sensibility will push back on it just being the
*  mindless laws of physics and evolution, yielding life on planet Earth. They haven't pushed as hard
*  on the quantum physicists and the cosmologists as they have on the biologists, but I have had
*  conversations, many of them are respectful as opposed to antagonistic where the view is that
*  I am wrong-headed, that I am missing the point and some of these religious folks are fantastically
*  accomplished scientists.
*  That's weird.
*  Yeah, I mean, I went to a gathering, I think I can talk about now, it was closed door gathering,
*  you weren't meant to describe it.
*  Probably don't get sued by this one too.
*  That's right, I'm really opening myself up. And I thought it was called Science and the Spiritual
*  Quest and it was a bunch of scientists that were being brought together and I thought it was going
*  to be an interesting but ultimately one-note meeting. I thought everybody's going to basically
*  say the same thing. There could be a God, there's no evidence for a God, we've got the laws of
*  physics and we're going to just press forward under the assumption that physics is all there is
*  until the clouds part and God reveals him or herself or itself to us and at that point we
*  may change our tune. It was not one-note. I was the only person who had that perspective in the
*  room. Everybody else was coming at religion from a very different way of thinking about the world.
*  In fact, there's one Nobel laureate in the room who got up and sang Psalms as part of his
*  presentation and I was sitting there and I was like, what is happening here? This is so unexpected
*  to me and what it really meant was I was so close-minded into the varieties of religious
*  engagement that happen in the world and it opened my eyes and this one Nobel laureate in particular,
*  I did say to him at the end, I said, when you look at me and you hear my view, what do you think?
*  And he kind of put his arm around me in an avuncular way and said, you know, you're a real
*  smart guy and you don't understand the true reality and I think ultimately you will because
*  you're open-minded and you're on a journey and I hope that your journey will finally take you to
*  the place where I have been for many years. That was so unexpected that this Nobel laureate who I
*  respected for his concrete mathematical and experimental work saw the world completely
*  differently. Now was there a spectrum of belief? Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. But I was the one
*  who was far out. You were untethered. Yeah, I mean, I came in and I was like, whoa, you know,
*  and now clearly they arranged the meeting to have a spectrum of perspectives. I mean,
*  this is not something that was randomly designed and it just so happened, but it was an eye-opener
*  and from that I went to read, do you know William James's book, Varieties of Religious Experience?
*  So, it's a book that William James, a great psychologist, wrote in 1902 and it was based
*  on a series of lectures I think he gave in Scotland and it is the most heartfelt and rational
*  approach to religion and science that I think has ever been written and yet most people don't
*  know much about it because what he does is he goes through and he documents through his own research
*  and through reading biographies and interviewing individuals the vastly different ways that people
*  think about religion and why they think about religion and the value that religion has in
*  their lives and when you read that book, it doesn't convert me. I haven't changed my views
*  on whether or not there is a God, but it has changed my views on the value of a religious
*  sensibility, the role that it plays in people's lives. Now look, it can be,
*  you know, you talk to people like Sam Harris and you know, it's a destructive force in the world
*  and it has been a destructive force in some ways, but that's not the full story. A fuller story is
*  that for some individuals, it gives a connection to a historical lineage that's deeply valued.
*  For some individuals, it puts their life in a larger setting that allows them to be in the
*  world in a more productive way. So there are a whole range of roles that religious engagement
*  can play. The problem is when you start to pit it against scientific insight, then you run into
*  trouble, but religion was never developed to give us factual information about the world. Religion
*  will never give us the electron magnetic moment to nine decimal places. That's the purview of
*  scientific investigation and if you can keep these straight in your mind, there's a definite
*  and powerful role for a religious sensibility in the world. Yeah, I feel like it gives people in a
*  lot of ways a scaffolding for ethics and morality and allows them some alleviation of anxiety.
*  Yeah, exactly. A feeling of purpose. But like you said, as long as it's not conflicting with
*  rigid scientific reality, like scientific provable scientific reality. Yeah, and I gotta tell you,
*  it's a funny thing. Richard Dawkins, I know you had him on the program. So you know that his
*  MO in the world is very anti-religious. I think he would agree with me on that. I don't want to
*  put words into his mouth. But I did an event with him in New York, the Beacon Theater, I don't know,
*  it was maybe a year ago or something like that. And it was very interesting because in a one-on-one
*  conversation, his views were very similar to mine. I felt like, look, we don't agree in totality.
*  But I was saying to him, there are times I go around the world and I will do things that are
*  utterly irrational. I'll knock on wood for good luck. I'll speak to my dead father. I know that
*  he's not really there. I'll pray to God on occasion if I think that I could use that backup. Not
*  because I think there's some bearded individual in the sky, it's just a behavioral tendency that I
*  find to be comforting and useful. And I said this to Richard, and he said, I totally get it. I was
*  like, what? He was like, I totally get it. He said, in fact, he said, I don't like to sleep in a house
*  that has a reputation as being haunted. And for me, it was such a beautiful human moment, it was
*  such a beautiful human moment where we were just like being human beings. And he said, we're both
*  sinners. And I agree, we are both sinners in that sense, because we know how the world works. We
*  know this doesn't make any sense. And yes, it's still part of somehow how we behave in the world.
*  And I think there's a value to recognizing that that is what it means to be human. You will engage
*  in the world in ways that are not necessarily strictly adhering to some rational perspective of
*  how the scientific world operates. I would love to see Richard Dawkins outside of a haunted house
*  saying, I'm not going in there. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. So, you know, it's all just to say that I
*  kind of feel like there are many pathways toward insight in the world. There are many ways to live
*  a life. There are many ways to come to terms with our own impermanence. And it's not as though
*  something is right or something is wrong. It's a question of, is it useful to you? And I think that
*  we have to be very open-minded in the kinds of behaviors that we allow to happen in the world.
*  You know, even rompta, it's nutty stuff. But if some of those individuals who go there
*  find that it allows them to live in the world in a more productive way, alleviating anxiety,
*  feeling like they're on a spiritual quest, so be it.
*  Yeah, that's the thing that's, I mean, it's hard for people to understand if you're not in that
*  space, that headspace that they are. You don't need this structure. But for some people, even
*  Scientology or something along those lines, it seems loopy on paper, can provide them with
*  legitimate structure and benefit their lives in a tangible way that they could describe to you.
*  Yeah, exactly. And my feeling is that if there was, and I don't know this to be the case,
*  maybe some biologists will push back on this, but if there was a race of, for want of a better word,
*  you know, Vulcan-like individuals who approach the world in a completely rational manner,
*  evaluating the data, figuring out the most sensible course of action, competing against
*  a crazy group of individuals like us who will come up with wild fictional ideas, gods in the
*  heavens, you know, demons haunting the world, I think it's the latter group that ultimately would
*  triumph because with that kind of freedom of thought, you get novelty, you get ingenuity,
*  you get creativity. And so I feel as though this is part and parcel of who we are and why we have
*  survived and to sort of come at the world with a scientific club that's meant to smash away
*  anything that disagrees with the scientific worldview is an unfortunate way of looking at
*  the world. Yeah, there's something about creativity that it doesn't necessarily have to abide by any
*  laws of logic and it can still be beneficial. Yeah, and that's why it's so stunning when somebody
*  comes up with something, it's like, where did that come from? It didn't come from a rational
*  approach to working out, you know, Brahms' Third Symphony. It emerged from the churning emotions
*  of an individual who happens to be made up of trillions of particles guided by physical law,
*  responding to the environment which is impinging his senses with an incredible array of influences
*  and through that world emerges this spectacular piece of music. That's breathtaking. Yeah.
*  Utterly breathtaking. Yeah, and it's amazing what that music can inspire as it reaches out to,
*  you know, X amount of people and then causes different thoughts in their mind. Yeah. And then
*  that causes in turn another branch of creativity, another new line of thinking that they might have
*  never pursued before. Yeah, and that to me establishes that the notion that language is
*  the only way that we can know about the world. You know, Wittgenstein had this perspective,
*  that the limits of my language, limits of my world, that seems to me utterly wrong. I mean,
*  the experience of music or the experience of cogitating about the world but not trying to
*  overlay a narrative upon it, just feeling your way into reality reveals things about the world
*  that I think are beyond linguistic. Do you ever listen to music when you're pondering an equation
*  or whether you're going over a problem? It's an interesting question. When I was in college,
*  I couldn't have any sound on when I was trying to say learn quantum mechanics or relativity. I would
*  find that it would capture my brain too fully and I couldn't focus on the equations that I was trying
*  to understand. But the funny thing is, in writing this book, for the very first time, I found that
*  there were passages that I couldn't write if it was quiet. I needed to have music playing because
*  in some sense, by focusing too directly on what I was trying to say, I couldn't say it. I only found
*  that I could make progress in certain kinds of descriptions by allowing my brain to fly off
*  through whatever musical experience I was playing and allowing the freedom of thought to then emerge
*  within that unusual, for me, environment. What kind of music reels do you mean?
*  Well, it varied incredibly. A lot of slayer?
*  No. So some of it was classical. I remember there's one vital passage when I was writing
*  was, do you know Pentatonix? They are a spectacular a cappella group who are able to take songs that
*  you have heard and transform them into sort of transcendent performances. So you should check
*  these guys out. But other times, it would just be loud rock, loud Beatles, loud Rolling Stones.
*  The soundtrack from The Greatest Showman, just blaring that thing. And somehow it just allowed
*  me a certain kind of linguistic freedom that I could not acquire in my normal way of being in
*  the world, which is everyone's quiet. Let me just work out my equations and I need total focus and
*  no distraction. So is this something that you sort of evolved over the course of your career?
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. It was not there early on. And there's this phenomenon, I don't know if this
*  is anything more than a metaphor or an analogy, but whatever. There are certain things in the
*  night sky that you can't see if you look at them directly. But by looking off axis, you're able to
*  invoke other qualities of the eye that are able to sense those features of the night sky. And I kind
*  of feel like it's the same thing. Sometimes by focusing directly on what you want to do,
*  you can't do it. And you've got to look obliquely, you got to look off axis metaphorically. And
*  that's the only way that you can accomplish what you set out to do. And certainly music is one of
*  the ways to take one's attention and shift it in a different direction to get that oblique view of
*  what it is that you're trying to do. And I have found that it allows for progress that otherwise
*  is unattainable. And is that the case also when you were writing this book? It absolutely was a
*  case writing this book. I have a very, a wife is very understanding. So we have a house up,
*  we live in Manhattan, I'm at Columbia, but she would let me go up to our house upstate with the
*  dogs and by myself, and I would disappear for weeks on end. And I'd hold myself up in this cabin in
*  the woods. And I would sometimes write deep into the night. And there were no neighbors around,
*  so I could turn on the music at whatever volume I found useful. And I would do it. And I would find,
*  you know, that it freed up a certain kind of creative thought process that to me was striking,
*  because I had never approached work in that way before. And it was really deeply interesting.
*  So how did you come to this idea of doing it that way?
*  I was struggling on certain things. And I felt as though I am approaching this in a very flat-footed
*  way. I want to write about this, you know, say want about write about human creativity, or want to
*  write about religious engagement. And I am just doing what I've always done, which is I have this
*  equation, and I want to solve it. So I'm going to bring the tools of mathematics to bear to solve it.
*  And I was approaching this writing project in exactly the same mind frame. And as it wasn't
*  working, I said, let me smack my brain around a little bit. And so one way of, you know,
*  it could be psychedelics, I didn't go that direction, but I smacked it around by forcing
*  myself to be subject to a great deal of distraction in the environment around me.
*  And it really made a difference.
*  It's interesting that you did it in a calculated manner.
*  Yeah, right. So I can't break free fully from my physicist training, you know.
*  But it's wise. I mean, that way of doing it is wise. And it's also a time tested, you know,
*  from Ralph Thoreau to, you know, beginning of time.
*  Yeah. And the funny thing is, it never worked for me in the past because the focus,
*  I think when I'm doing mathematics, it does need, at least for me personally,
*  to be that kind of non distracted total focus on what's going on.
*  As a writer, it's a very romantic notion too, to go to the woods in a cabin, that's what's up.
*  Yeah, right.
*  That's what everybody wants to do.
*  Yeah, right. Right. Exactly.
*  You know, and missing is whiskey. You're supposed to get drunk out there.
*  Yeah, that I didn't. I had the dogs and it's just, like I said, I hardly ever drink,
*  you know. But it was an unusual creative experience, which to me, opened up a different
*  way of going about trying to create things in the world.
*  As you write more and more books, do you find it to be more and more difficult or do you find it
*  to be easier?
*  Well, my early books were all focused on trying to bring scientific ideas out to the general
*  public. You know, the elegant universe was about string theory, fabric of the cosmos,
*  space and time, hidden realities about multiple universes. And so in that role,
*  I'm basically trying to translate from the cutting edge research into ordinary human language so that
*  people who don't want to go to graduate school can get the basic idea of what's going on.
*  And this book is a very different proposition. I feel like I've moved in a significantly different
*  direction through this book because, yes, there's science, you know, entropy, evolution,
*  the history of the universe from the beginning to the end, but the focus on why we humans do what
*  we do, why we tell stories, the emergence of language, why we tell myths, why we engage in
*  religious experience, why creative expression is so important to us. This felt like it was
*  drawing upon things I've been thinking about for decades but never put into writing. So it was a
*  harder exercise than anything that I did before because it was a different exercise. But in the
*  end, one that I felt was even more gratifying because it was making clear why these ideas matter.
*  As opposed to just trying to tickle the brain of the reader, I'm trying to actually,
*  if you will, touch the heart and soul of the reader. And that's something which, if it's
*  successful, feels very gratifying. I would imagine that would be very hard to end,
*  to feel how, like, to put the cover on it and to go, that's it. Yeah, right, it is. But that's true
*  almost with all books. You know, the famous adage is that you never finish a book, you abandon them.
*  That's all that ever happens. And that was true in spades in this particular case because
*  the subject was so big. And you can always imagine going further in this direction or enhancing that
*  description. But at some point you recognize that, you know, life is an ongoing process. And a book
*  is ultimately a snapshot of where the author was at the moment that the book was written. And that,
*  to me, is really what happens here. This is a snapshot of my view of the human conditions
*  set against the cosmological unfolding. And how much of your perceptions of these things has
*  evolved, you know, as an educator and as a scientist and as a person who's in the public eye?
*  How much of your perceptions on these ideas have changed over the course of your career?
*  Huge, huge. I think I was a very hard-nosed science thinker when I started out. I think part of this
*  may have been I became a professor at a relatively young age. I think I was 27 when I got my first
*  faculty job, so many of the graduate students were the same age as me. So I think I felt the need
*  to have a very rigid scientific outlook on the world because of that. And, you know,
*  as I've gotten older, that has changed. And my willingness to entertain a broader range of thought
*  and experience and ways of being has absolutely grown. The other thing that's had a vast and
*  vital impact on me are students. You know, for 30 years, the only thing I really taught was technical
*  physics courses, quantum mechanics or relativity, you know, thermodynamics. And what do you do there?
*  You're at the blackboard, you're putting equations up there, you're trying to get the kids to be able
*  to solve problems and understand what the mathematics is all about. So the only thing
*  that you're really ever doing is touching the cognitive part of their brain. For the last few
*  years, I've been teaching a course, the students didn't know it, that's actually based on this book.
*  So I wanted to try out the ideas with young minds. So I taught a course at Columbia called
*  Origins and Meaning. And in that course, I had students from across the campus, not just the
*  physics students, I had the neurosurgeons, the anthropology students, the linguistic students,
*  the theological students, you know, so it was a whole range of students. And to see how their
*  understanding of how their major or subject fits in to the cosmological unfolding changed many of
*  their perspectives on what it is that they're studying and what they're doing. And to have
*  students come to my office and to feel shooken up, shaken up, whatever the right form of that verb is,
*  where they're saying, you know, I've lived my life in such a way, but now when I think about religion
*  as perhaps an evolutionarily interesting and useful development as opposed to something from on high,
*  or when I think about creative expression as something that might seed ingenuity and
*  innovation as opposed to something that is just pure inspiration coming from the outer world,
*  I'm thinking about my life differently. And some of them frankly would be upset. I'd had students
*  come in tears. And I'd never had them when I teach quantum mechanics, you know, yeah, more than one,
*  more than one, because they'd say this course is kind of shaking my sense of who I am and what I am
*  in the world. What was the key aspect of it that was shaking them? Well, for some students, it was
*  it was the notion of religion because many of them, or at least some of them, had a traditional
*  religious upbringing, and their academic life and their religious life were completely separate.
*  And now when you have a course in which you're focusing upon how it would be that this institution
*  of religion might naturally evolve on planet Earth based upon what we know about humans and human
*  brains and the evolutionary pressures that we've been under, some of them began to think about
*  religion as a very different proposition than the one that they had when they were growing up.
*  And I was in a position that I'd never been before of basically counseling a student and saying, hey,
*  it's okay to have your world shake a little bit. It's okay to think about things. You may come back
*  to exactly where you were before this course, but if a collection of ideas can make you rethink your
*  life, at least it'll cast it in a different light. It'll illuminate it differently. Go with it. See
*  what happens. And I never had a conversation like that when teaching Schrodinger's equation,
*  and for me it was the most gratifying pedagogical experience that I've ever had
*  because you're reaching the whole person as opposed to just reaching this cognitive technique
*  of solving equations. If you can talk religion with a really intelligent person who's objective,
*  who has a belief, it's such an interesting subject because it requires suspension of disbelief in
*  order to absorb some of the stories, but there's clearly a history behind this of thousands of
*  years of translations and you're trying to get to the, what did they mean when they wrote this down?
*  How much did they know? And what were they trying to do? Were they just trying to get everybody to
*  calm down and stay in line? Or were they trying to find some means of gluing the group together
*  by a shared belief? Or there are folks who basically say that there are qualities of the human
*  brain that naturally leave it open to a religious sensibility. For instance, we have agency detection
*  systems in our brain where we look around the world and we tend to assign agency to things that
*  happen. That's useful, right? Because if you mistake a windblown branch for a jaguar, yeah,
*  it's fine. You thought it was a jaguar, but it's just a branch. But if the reverse happens,
*  you think it was a jaguar and you think it's a windblown branch, you're going to get eaten.
*  So we tend to over-endow agency into the world. There is evolutionary value to that. So when the
*  wind blows, we tend to think there's a mind up there. When the river gurgles, we tend to think
*  that there's a mind in there. And this is sort of the seed for the kinds of perspectives that
*  you'll find in many of the world's religions. So there's natural course of events that can lead to
*  the arising of the institution or at least the ideas behind the institution of religion.
*  And for students that have never encountered that idea before, it can really shake things up. And I
*  think in a very valuable way. So I think you're absolutely right. Having a conversation
*  with somebody who has a religious perspective is deeply interesting to understand where that mind
*  came to the place that it got to. And from a personal sensibility, I just give you one
*  little anecdote. My dad died, I was 23 years old. And unexpectedly, I'd been visiting home,
*  I was at Harvard at the time, I was visiting from Cambridge and we had a nice weekend.
*  And by the time I got back to Cambridge on the bus, my mom called me and said, Dad's dead.
*  It was so shocking. It was like so sudden. It was so complete. And I remember I went back home,
*  and my dad was not a religious man, but we knew that he would want to have a religious ceremony.
*  And we did it. And we had a minion of Jews coming to the house to recite the Kaddish prayer,
*  because we weren't religious, we didn't know what we were doing. And I had no idea
*  what these men were saying. But it was deeply comforting. In fact, I didn't want to know what
*  they were saying. To me, it was just a collection of ancient sounds. But the sounds connected me
*  across the generations to a culture that had been extended back 5,000 years. And in a moment of
*  crisis, that was a very comforting and useful connection to have.
*  Yeah, that is where I find people get the most out of religion. And the fact that it brings
*  communities together in this sort of cohesive ritual where everybody acts together and everybody,
*  you feel like there's completion to it. Like you're putting someone into perspective and
*  you're doing so with this religious ceremony. And when large groups of people get together
*  and engage in a ritual behavior, something magical happens. I've spoken to evolutionary
*  psychologists like Steve Pinker, who is a wonderful thinker.
*  I've had him in here too.
*  Yeah, okay. And Steve is skeptical that this kind of ritual behavior can yield the kind of
*  cohesive bonding that some people suggest that it does. But you probably have, I have on occasion
*  engaged in these ritual behaviors, you know, mass drumming and movement. And I gotta tell you,
*  you are quickly, I find, transported to a place where you are now part of a collective and you
*  feel yourself melting into the group and you are one. And if you've never had that experience,
*  I think it's something that you should have because I think it's a vital part of our heritage. It is
*  part of how we got to be who we are.
*  Yeah, there's something about group acceptance and a group of people acting and doing something
*  together that does create this very strange bond. It doesn't necessarily exist amongst
*  individuals. It's a weird bond.
*  It is a very weird bond because it has nothing to do with the individuals, nothing to do with
*  the personality of Jim or Mary. It's irrelevant at that point. It's somehow joining you together
*  into this mass of humanity that's all engaged in the same practice and somehow you feel as though
*  your identity melts into the larger whole. I don't know why it happens.
*  There's negative aspects to that sort of thing.
*  Of course.
*  Or that mob mentality.
*  Of course.
*  Like have you ever been in a situation where things got chaotic and you really had this feeling
*  like anything can happen at any moment?
*  I've seen it happen. I've never been part of it.
*  It's very weird.
*  But I have a sort of feeling in the air.
*  Yeah, I have an analogous one, which is, you know, my brother is a Hare Krishna.
*  And so, you know, he is 13 years older than me and left college in the 60s, which was a tumultuous
*  time and went to Europe and ultimately joined into what many people think of as some kind of
*  cultish activity. But he's not a cult thinker. He's an original thinker. He's a brilliant thinker.
*  And yet within this group mentality, you can imagine a certain kind of group think can take
*  over. At least people imagine that this happens. So yes, it has positive aspects and it can have
*  negative aspects. But in the end, I think there is a long lineage in which those of our forebears
*  who survived were the ones who could join together into these more potent, these more
*  powerful groups. And that way we're able to triumph over other groups, you know,
*  in the ancestral environment. You know, there's different readings of the archaeological record,
*  whether it was a dangerous place in the hunter-gatherer past or a sort of placid place.
*  But one reading says it was a very dangerous place and therefore those groups that survived
*  were the ones who were able to establish this kind of allegiance to the whole.
*  Yes.
*  And certainly, I think this kind of ritual behavior may have been part of that.
*  Bond together through shared experience.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  And belief.
*  Yeah.
*  And if you're all believing in the same supernatural entity, that's a powerful,
*  in principle, powerful glue.
*  Do you find that there's, I mean, I don't want to say an arrogance in some academics,
*  maybe it's not the right word, but this being too quick to dismiss any positive benefit at all
*  about religion.
*  Yes. It's the knee-jerk reaction among a certain group of academics. And
*  it feels deeply unfortunate to me. It almost feels like a religion of its own sort when
*  it's just the response as opposed to a careful, thoughtful, heartfelt analysis of the situation.
*  I frankly wish that more people would read William James's book because I do think that
*  it's the kind of, because here's a scientist, right, a deeply thoughtful scientist who knows
*  how to analyze data, knows how to rationally engage with the world, who was plumbing the
*  depths of religion in a very, very meaningful and sensitive way. And by the end of these lectures,
*  I think it was lecture number 20 or something, he describes religion as something that helps
*  the journey toward the terror and the beauty of phenomenon. He describes it as the voice of the
*  thunder, the gentleness of the summer rain. He described it in terms of the sublimity of the
*  stars and this kind of transcendent approach to the religious experience, I think, brings it out of
*  the academic guise that is often thrown upon it, which is something that is contravening everything
*  we know about the world. It's causing people to think in ways that are irrational. I mean,
*  this whole trope that you hear, it's not that there isn't some truth to that, but it's an
*  incomplete truth. And if you're willing to approach religion in a way where you discard
*  the pieces that offend you, throw away the parts that you think are utter nonsense,
*  only keep those aspects that are useful to you in your life, then there is a place for it.
*  Pete I think therein lies the problem with a lot of people. They're not willing to do that.
*  Jared Right.
*  Pete This need for suspension of disbelief troubles them so much that they feel like fools if they buy
*  into something. And we're also dealing with all religions except the ones that are super
*  questionable like Scientology or Mormonism that are very old. And the idea of maybe it would be
*  better if we came up with something that we could all agree on in 2020. Maybe it would be
*  wonderful if we have something that maybe has science in it, maybe something that has a genuine
*  understanding of how human beings react and what the benefits of community and having these
*  environments where loving, conscious people communicate with each other in a very positive
*  way. That this could be a new form of this thing that we seem to desire so greatly.
*  Jared Yeah, and I agree. And I have to say I make this point in the book. Because the point that I
*  make there is that to truly engage with the world, you have to use a variety of stories.
*  We're fundamentally storytellers. That's what human beings are. Now, there's the reduction of
*  story that physicists are well equipped to talk about with particles and laws of physics.
*  On top of that, you've got the chemist story, the complex molecules. You've got the biologist story
*  that begins to talk about cells and life. You got the psychological story, the neurophysiological
*  story that brings a mind and consciousness. And within that, you then have all of the
*  activities that conscious beings undertake, which includes religion and includes telling other kinds
*  of stories and includes creative expression. You need them all. And to sort of say that the
*  scientific account is the only account by which you're ever going to gain true qualities of the
*  world is a very, in my view, limited description of what truth is. There is objective truth in the
*  world that we can measure, that we can describe the equations of so forth. But there's also
*  internal truth, spiritual truth that you get to by self-examination. It's real in the sense that
*  you're understanding how you respond to the world. And that is something which is deeply personal,
*  but utterly real. And whether it's through psychedelics, whether it's through ayahuasca,
*  whether it's through a spiritual journey, whether it's through religion, regardless, all of this
*  adds color to the story of what it means to be a human being.
*  Pete Do you spend any time meditating?
*  Jared I do. I'm not particularly effective at it. And so –
*  Pete Most people are that way.
*  Jared Yeah, you know. But you know, years ago –
*  Pete Including the most effective ones.
*  Jared Well, years ago, a friend of mine bought me one of these Transcendental Meditation courses,
*  and I was like, okay, I'll just try it. He spent the money, I'm going to actually go and do it.
*  And it was kind of eye-opening. There was a lot of what you might call woo-woo stuff that was
*  happening in the lectures. And in fact, the funny thing is the guy giving the lecture,
*  he did recognize me. And you could, I could tell how uncomfortable he was giving his normal
*  description because he kept looking at me sheepishly as he would invoke quantum physics and
*  things of that sort. But I was like, I told him, I'm not here to judge you, I'm just here to sort
*  of see what's going on. But the idea of allowing the mind to be in a different mode of operation,
*  which is sort of how I summarize the experience. You know, if you're reciting the mantra in your
*  mind and allowing that to be a sort of pedal point, a driver of how your mind is behaving at
*  that moment, that's a very different way of being in the world from thinking about grocery shopping
*  or solving Einstein's equations. And I think that to me is the value of it. It's a systematic way
*  to put your mind in a different mode of operation. And at times I find it very useful to move into
*  that place. When you started doing Transcendental Meditation, what about it was weird?
*  Well, what was weird, number one, was doing this in this group setting, which is how you start on
*  this course. And moreover, it being framed in a manner that I had trouble aligning with my
*  understanding of how the world works by virtue of the lectures that were given to us for what it is
*  what we're doing. But through the practice, I sort of found, I'm sure I'm just translating from what
*  they were saying in the lecture into a language that I'm more comfortable with. And that made it
*  less weird for me because- Sort of like what you were talking about religion, just kind of cutting
*  out the thing- Cutting out the thing that didn't make any sense to me and saying, hey, what is this
*  really about? What this really is about is breaking the usual chain of thought that is 99.9% of the
*  time of how I live in the world and allowing my brain to have a chain of thought that is artificial
*  because I'm sitting here forcing myself to recite this mantra inside my mind. But that's a very
*  useful way of being because it's unfamiliar and it's novel and it allows my brain to operate in
*  a different way. So when I translated it into that language, it all of a sudden made a lot more sense
*  to me and became not weird at all. It became an interesting practice. And do you still do it?
*  I do it when I feel I need it. So either friends of mine who say, I cannot live in the world if I
*  don't do my 20 minutes in the morning. Simply, that's part of my routine. I don't feel that way,
*  but there are moments when I say, whoa, I need to do it. And based on circumstance, based on what's
*  happening at a given moment, it allows a kind of mental reset if that's a language that makes sense.
*  And that reset I consider to be a valuable thing to do. So do you do this?
*  I do. I don't do TM, but I do meditate. Regular basis.
*  Yeah, regular basis. And I also have a float tank here.
*  Oh, you do? Really? Like a deprivation?
*  Yeah. In this building?
*  Yeah, it's right over there. I'll show it to you after we're done.
*  Wow. Can I do it?
*  Sure. You could if you want. Have you done it before?
*  I've never done it before. I find it a little bit terrifying.
*  Do you live in Manhattan?
*  I do. Yeah.
*  There's plenty of them. There's a bunch of different float places. It's not terrifying at all.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. You just float, relax.
*  But it's complete darkness.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I have some claustrophobia. And that's like, for instance, I can't go into an MRI machine.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah. Yeah, totally.
*  But you're so smart. Why don't you get that out of your head?
*  I tried. I got to tell you, I trained. So I have a desk in my office where it's only about
*  like one foot high. And I'd slide my body underneath the desk, lock the door because
*  it looked too weird. And I'd stay under there as long as I possibly could just to train myself.
*  How long is that? Like 15, 20. But I get into the real machine and...
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  My wife's mom is like that. Like she did an MRI and she's like, it was the worst experience
*  of my life. I'm like, I did two of them last week. I fell asleep.
*  I totally understand her.
*  I totally do.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  I don't understand why someone as smart as you would not recognize, well, there's just this thing
*  around me and I can...
*  I do. I do. But it's like the irrational part of being. I get in there, my heart starts to pound.
*  Where do you think that comes from?
*  I don't know because it wasn't always there. And it has gotten worse in certain... There was a time
*  again, I'm going to come across like a nutcase in here.
*  Maybe it was that trip to Amsterdam.
*  Yeah, the trip to Amsterdam.
*  Wapped your brain out.
*  There was actually times when I couldn't even go in a tunnel in a car. The claustrophobia was that
*  bad.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. I was in a taxi cab. I had to go to New Jersey, Manhattan, so I had to take the Lincoln
*  Tunnel. And as the taxi's approaching the tunnel, I said to the guy, I can't do it. I can't do it.
*  And the guy says, well, I can't let you out. It's illegal to let you out. I said, you've got to
*  let me out. I can't do it. And I just opened the door and I got out.
*  Oh my God. That's so crazy.
*  But now I'm fine with tunnels. So I don't know what it is that...
*  Maybe you're too smart.
*  Accentuated it there.
*  Maybe you're too smart. And maybe your brain is playing tricks with you and giving you anxiety
*  to sort of...
*  Shake it up the world and yeah, maybe.
*  Because you're constantly contemplating the gigantic picture of the actual scope of the
*  universe and...
*  Yeah, but now I'm pretty stable about these things. So it's just MRI machines where it's
*  really close into your face.
*  Well, you got to just do a lot of MRIs. Get over that.
*  Right. Exactly. I'm sure that would do it. That would absolutely do it.
*  Probably, right? If you just do MRIs on a regular basis.
*  Then I'm sure you get used to it.
*  But yeah, I just do a real simple type of meditation. I probably am eventually going
*  to take a TM course because my friend Tom Papa, he's really into TM and he raves about it.
*  But I just sit down and I breathe. I just concentrate only on my breath. And it comes
*  and goes, but I concentrate only on my breath. And I find really good relief from that. Yoga
*  is the same thing. I do yoga. I try to do it at least twice a week when I...
*  Oh, you do? Okay.
*  Yeah. There's a lot of benefit in that in the same way in that it's so difficult and in the poses,
*  if you can only concentrate on your breath, just balance and concentrate on your breath,
*  you'll be filled with activity enough with things to concentrate on with the balancing
*  of the posture and then the breath that it acts as almost a brain scouring.
*  It cleanses the mind of unnecessary anxieties and a lot of other just...
*  But you've been doing that for a long time, is this a reason?
*  No, yoga has been... I've been pretty steady for the last four years.
*  Right. Right. Yeah, my wife does a lot of yoga. She keeps telling me that I need to do it.
*  It's great. It's great for the body as well. And I think the more comfortable your body is,
*  the better you're... At least for me, the better my mind works.
*  Yeah, I have a little doubt.
*  Do you exercise?
*  I do exercise.
*  You know, for the last year I've been doing Peloton bike.
*  That's good.
*  You know, but then I herniated a disc in my back and for the last two months,
*  I've basically been unable to move.
*  How did you do that?
*  Well, you know, I think it was throwing out the Christmas tree.
*  Oh, okay. That makes sense.
*  You know, the bending and the... And you know, my 92-year-old mother has used this opportunity
*  to say, because we're Jewish, we weren't allowed to have a Christmas tree going up.
*  This is meaningful right here.
*  Oh, that's funny.
*  You know, but my Christian wife is all too happy that I'm flexible on that count for sure.
*  What is going on with your back now?
*  Yeah, well, it's bad. It's bad.
*  Did you get an MRI?
*  I did get an MRI.
*  You went through the machine?
*  Yeah, so I'm...
*  Is it pushing against the nerves?
*  Pushing against the nerves.
*  Yeah. Have you heard of something called Regenekin? Do you know what that is?
*  No, I don't.
*  Regenekin is something that I used for a bulging disc and it's incredibly beneficial. It was
*  created by a doctor in Germany and it was illegal in the United States until a few years back. They
*  moved the process over here. It's not covered by insurance, but it's very, very beneficial for that.
*  And what they do is it's essentially a more advanced version of platelet-rich plasma.
*  So they take your blood out, they do this process, it takes about 12 hours, and then they
*  re-inject this serum. They take the serum out of the blood, it looks like this yellow serum,
*  and they inject it directly into the areas.
*  So right into the spine.
*  Right into the area where the spine is bulging.
*  And it allows it to relax. It's the most potent anti-inflammation drug that they can use.
*  It's like instead of cortisone, which is what they've been talking about.
*  Exactly. Well, cortisone can help you as well. It can at least provide temporary relief. But
*  what this does is actually heals the area.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. It's very beneficial. I had a real bad bulging disc in my neck that was making my hands
*  go numb.
*  So my toes are numb.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Yeah. But they can give you relief. And it's in Santa Monica. There's a place called Lifespan
*  Medicine. I'll connect you to the doctor.
*  Yeah, please. I'm so curious about what to do.
*  I just sent a friend of mine there. He had a real problem with his neck. Within two weeks,
*  it was better. He got hit by a car when he was on his motorcycle. My friend, Dean Del Ray,
*  and he was really fucked up. His back was so bad that we were at the comic store and I'm like,
*  people came near him and he tensed up. I go, what's the matter? He goes, dude, my neck is
*  so messed up. Somebody bumps into me. I'm in sharp pain. And I'm like, really? And then he
*  started describing to me. So I said, I've got the thing for you. And I sent him to this place.
*  Regenekine's amazing. I've had it done several times.
*  Regenekine, I got to check that out.
*  I've had it done on my lower back. Well, a lot of athletes like Peyton Manning and
*  Kobe Bryant, they flew to Germany to get this procedure done.
*  Because it was the only place it was legal then.
*  Including the UFC president, Dana White, which is where I found out about it. And then I found
*  out that they were opening offices in America. In Dallas, they have one. They have one in Santa
*  Monica and I think somewhere else. Maybe New York.
*  I have to- Maybe. Yeah. But it's an amazing procedure.
*  I mean, it really is super beneficial, particularly for that kind of an injury.
*  Because it's been tough. I mean, for instance, I can't sleep because there's no position.
*  Now, the value of that is I have done so much reading over the last two months because I'm
*  like up half the night and I only conk out when it's like utter, utter exhaustion.
*  Have you used spinal decompression? Have you ever done any of that?
*  I did. I went to this physical therapy place where they put me up on pulleys
*  and it kind of pulled the feet, I guess, away from the back. It wasn't like being stretched
*  fully, but your own weight was causing the vertebrae to separate.
*  Did that help you? Huge relief.
*  Yeah. You can get a small inversion table. Yeah, I was thinking about that.
*  Yeah. Well, I have one out here you could try too.
*  Oh, I'd love to try it. Yeah, I have a whole gym out here.
*  There's another thing called the reverse hyper machine. And the reverse hyper machine was created
*  by this, he's a very famous power lifter named Louis Simmons. And Louis had this idea, he's
*  very brilliant guy. And he had this idea that they were trying to fuse his discs, he had a
*  bulging disc. And he's like, well, a disc is compressed. Like, how do you get it to decompress?
*  And he developed this machine that strengthens the back when you lift up the legs. But then in the
*  lowering of the legs, it provides active decompression. And it alleviated his problem.
*  Do you wear this? No, no, I'll show it to you. I'll show it
*  to you afterwards. It's a machine that you get. But-
*  See, we are physical beings, right? We have a mind that can sort of the edge of the cosmos, man. But
*  you got a bulging disc, it doesn't matter. Oh, yeah. Pain is real. I mean, you have to
*  deal with it. And you have to be really careful. And for me, what's really critical is physical
*  maintenance. And I'm very dedicated to physical maintenance, even if there's nothing wrong.
*  So called building the core? Yes. A lot of chin ups, sit ups, a lot of lower back exercises,
*  hyper back extensions, anything to keep things strong, squats, making sure that the more tissue
*  you have, the more strength you have in that tissue around particularly protecting your joints
*  and your spine, the healthier you're going to be. That's just-
*  No, it's absolutely vital because the last few months have been hell, I have to say.
*  I'll show you. Listen, we've already talked for two and a half hours. So I'll take you to the back.
*  Yeah, I'll show you. Yeah.
*  Brian, thank you very much for being here. I really appreciate you. I appreciate all your work.
*  And tell people your book, one more time is the title.
*  Until the end of time. It's out today.
*  It's out today at Mind, Matter and Our Search for Meaning in an Evolving Universe.
*  Beautiful. Thank you for being here, man.
*  Thank you. My pleasure.
*  Bye, everybody.
*  Thank you.
*  Come on.
*  Yeah, I'd love to. Thank you.
