# Joe Rogan Experience #1387 - Josh Homme
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 19, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPf0swdYOxI)
*  boom
*  Did you roll in a motorcycle I did you're a fucking animal in this day and age in LA traffic
*  but the there's a there's a bit of a
*  Zen thing happening because if you don't pay attention you could die, you know, oh right, you know, I and I find myself
*  Trying to have this field of view and plus you can't be on the phone, right?
*  Because I think sometimes when it's when you drive a car you forget to take the moment to do nothing
*  We're just sort of be for a second
*  Yeah
*  And you can listen to tunes and it makes all the songs better
*  like I I don't know if I fully appreciated Judas Priest until I
*  Rode a motorcycle and could listen to music like so you listen like in your head like you have it in
*  No, that one has a I I'm the luxury of having a couple of them
*  And but that one's almost like the grandpa bike for going to the movies
*  But is it it speakers or is it in the helmet its speakers?
*  I don't do the helmet because there's so much of that in my life. Anyways, like point-blank range
*  Yeah, and so it's it's almost like you kind of end up
*  Rocking your head like that and you're like breaking the law. It's it's sort of like flips your beavers switch
*  And and it feels wonderful like
*  the the wind in your hair
*  Yeah, and and getting here took
*  Why don't know where you came from but I I beat you here and I left but after you did
*  Where do you where'd you drive from like I can't I was sort of over by Runyon Canyon. Okay
*  Yeah, if you live in like Orange County, I get it because it's really like the only way you're gonna get here and not lose
*  Your fucking mind. Well something that's 21 miles away is 25 minutes away
*  Legitimately. Yeah. I mean, there's a little bit of like
*  I go stop here and also you're always going to the front of traffic
*  Which really is the safest place to be at the very front?
*  Sure, just everyone on each butt cheek sort of you know
*  The thing that freaks me out though is the lane splitting like some some people are just not paying attention
*  And some people some people are and they're like asked. Yeah that some people work out their their kinky anger on you
*  Oh on the bike, you mean?
*  Like something's like no way if I'm stuck in this you're stuck in this that is fucking weird man that thing's weird
*  well kind of anger against motorcycles like that they can they can get ahead and you can't just
*  It's it's beyond motorcycles. You know, it's that angriness of like they're
*  Their emotional bank accounts are low in that moment and they're like, how about you? Yeah, you can have that too
*  It's like sharing the wrong shit
*  Yeah, that's I think it's people that don't feel like there's a way out of the light they're in too
*  There's no there's no light at the end of the tunnel. Yeah, the Missouri loves company. It's just like
*  Welcome to the Missouri loves company sit out and they're just like
*  it's just I don't know I've so much has have been happening for me lately and I just
*  You have those things when they click and you and then you can't unknow them. Once you've learned something
*  Yeah, and it's like I see how that is just really
*  Attempting to elevate your own situation by bringing someone down
*  Yes, which is impossible and it's so in that moment that that's almost them doing the best they can
*  I know they're trying to kill you
*  But but it they're trying to cope with something that's it just maybe the wrong way
*  It's definitely the wrong way. Nope. That's one of the weird things about being a kid, right?
*  Like nobody really tells you how to think
*  Nobody really teaches you how to approach
*  Situations in life and what's gonna help you and what's not gonna help you at all
*  But you learn some funky stuff instead
*  Yeah, you know what I mean? And even when you're learning the history of someone it seems like they don't tell you
*  how they've wrestled with that emotion to do the right thing or or
*  Find a way to just accept something
*  Like how did they get to accept that? This was their decision that they had to make right? I don't know. There's not there's not much
*  there's not many guideposts for how to
*  Treat yourself and other people but there's like there's there's all sorts of math and stuff like that
*  Yeah, but even history, right? There's a lot of facts this happened then that happened
*  This is the date that this took place
*  But the actual accounts from the human beings and even if you read it, it's like I want to see the person say it
*  You know, I almost that's what the Ken Burns version of all that
*  there's one guy in the Ken Burns the Civil War one who's kind of like
*  Was probably alive then too like just it seems like he's so
*  passionate about it and he's such a good storyteller and so he's he's adding the emotions of like, you know when when
*  Robert E Lee was or I'm sorry the Union guy
*  He listens grant grant grant but had a drinking problem
*  But then was like oh and he probably have it from PTSD
*  You know, and he's he's just telling that story with such
*  Kind of emotional depth of his school. It's nice to watch that instead of read it sometimes
*  Yeah
*  I don't think any of us are ever gonna be able to truly understand what it was like to live without
*  Television without radio without cell phones and war like what?
*  And then war inside the same continent with other people that are supposed to be just like you that speak the same language
*  Yeah, that you run the risk of going hey, hey Gary, yeah
*  Especially if you live in like fucking Virginia or somewhere on the border
*  You could know the person who's facing you sure and be like best of luck to you Gary
*  I yeah, I hope I do and don't get you
*  I don't know what to think I was reading this article too about how many murders took place after the war was settled
*  Where you know, right like where people like hey, you know, we're not done bro. Yeah, you killed my whole fucking family
*  Yeah, they're like cool Lincoln. We're good. Yeah, we're not good
*  I started sass nate people but after after
*  what would seem like a lifetime of that sort of witnessing that and doing that and
*  watching things that you recognize as injustice the idea of someone getting stuck in the blame and
*  And as a as the vendetta in that I can I can I can see that I but you see how that's really
*  It's probably why we're still having problems now
*  It's definitely some part of it right yeah, it's like my great great great great told me
*  Yeah, you know when people are sort of like dipped in that cool
*  A to because it my great great great great great felt this way. Mm-hmm
*  I'm supposed to too because yeah, we're related. So dude, I'm almost done with this book
*  I'm listening this audiobook Empire the summer moon. It is fucking insane. It's all about the war
*  I
*  Mean Gary fucking Gary's fucking Gary. So look Gary
*  SC Gwyn
*  Gw y n ne Empire the summer moon
*  It's all about the the war with the Plains tribes the Plains Plains Indians versus the settlers is fucking
*  Insane man. It's insane. It's like I all everyone knows that there was European settlers and they had
*  Indians and there was a lot of things that happened
*  but until you read like the
*  accounts of all the different battles and all the things that happened and all the
*  Slaughter's and all the chaos and the kid the children and the and the messages sent by more violent like oh
*  Dude, and and you think you're sending one message, but you're really giving the wrong. Yeah, I
*  Can't I can't imagine and it's so far away for maybe you and I yeah that reading that is like it's like
*  When you don't think about it, it's sort of like it's just an app
*  I don't use or something in this day and age to see if they have a photo of Cynthia and Parker
*  there's a couple photos of this woman who was a she was kidnapped by the
*  by the Comanche's when she was nine and
*  Her mother everyone her family was brutally murdered
*  there was a raid on her town, but they kidnapped her and she became a part of the Comanche's and she married a chief and had
*  babies with them and then they they've
*  Captured her again when when these settlers so this is a photo of this lady
*  This lady became a Comanche and then fucking hated coming back to civilization
*  Oh, she was the Comanche finally lost and that's what was she was forced to do is be re-kidnapped
*  see that's a famous photo of her the one that you just had Jamie in the left-hand side because she's breastfeeding and
*  She has a bare breast and she's doing this and they they used it for some sort of newspaper story and
*  They never did that with with like like a regular white woman
*  They did it with her because they wanted to show that even though this woman was raised
*  You know until she was nine years old by white people she became a savage
*  And that's why they have her they're
*  Breastfeeding her half Indian baby. It's so sad man. The story about her is so sad because she didn't want to go back
*  Well, what do you think trying to escape?
*  What do you think the you know, everyone does something with some intention that and I think mostly people think they're it's a good intention
*  Whether that works out or not. Mm-hmm. But what do you think the the thought process was behind being Comanche?
*  slaughtering everyone else and saying we're gonna keep this this gal and and and then kind of
*  Take her into the fold. That sounds like a lovingly lovingly taken into the fold
*  It was so more pragmatic apparently according to this book
*  They didn't have a high birth rate because women would miscarry a lot because they were on horses all the time
*  Yeah, cuz they rode horses. They were they were a wild fucking tribe, man
*  It was really amazing reading the accounts of rough what their life was so rough
*  But they didn't have like pottery and baskets. They're like, but they're rough. Yeah, I mean they were war like they're all
*  That was their whole thing and war with other tribes. Yeah, just as much previous
*  Yeah, before the Europeans came they were fucking everybody up they fucked everybody up the Comanche's were just ruthless man
*  Yeah, all they did was kill buffalo and eat buffalo meat
*  They were just eating meat and just riding horses and fucking people up. Okay that that part sounded delicious
*  Amazing right buffalo meat open fire. I mean there's something incredibly
*  Family, you know just with a it's one of the things about
*  Native Americans versus the Western settlers or the the people that settled is that?
*  No one ever
*  Like Native Americans never wanted to join European civilization. It was not their thing
*  Well, yeah, but Europeans did join these try not just as Cynthia and Parker lady
*  But a bunch a bunch of people just made friends with the Indians learned the language
*  It became a part of their culture and they were like fuck you
*  In stores and all your bullshit you want to have tea in the middle of the day here dressed like that
*  It's sort of like
*  Settlers come in and what they're what they're settling for is that they're gonna try to make the rest of the world look like what?
*  They are yeah, and they won't be able to so we'll settle for whatever we get and then there's these other people that are just
*  Sort of living good downstream. It seems like the settlers are fighting upstream always and and the Indians are just living
*  Downstream they're going with what's there? Yeah, they're going with what they're becoming part of the land instead of
*  We should really force this thing and to make it sit there were so fucking ruthless though man, so ruthless
*  It's crazy to read all the depictions all the things that they did
*  But it just the there's something so insanely romantic about their life like they were talking about Cynthia and Parker's
*  When they brought her back in her 30s, they brought her back to civilization how difficult it was for her to sort of
*  Reintegrate and that like the world of the Comanche was like a world of magic like in that everything was a god
*  There's wind gods and fire gods and the the trees were gods
*  There was like thousands of got now all of a sudden she had to believe in one God
*  Well are just like where you're deliberately blocking all those gods on purpose right every turn, right?
*  Yeah, because if you I mean who's to say that that like really engaging?
*  With the gods of the wind and all that
*  doesn't open this thing for you for somebody because
*  There wasn't tons of people like you said trying to be in the white world
*  No, it was that but there was a shit ton of people a metric fuck ton trying to be Comanche
*  And yeah, Paiute and and you name it, you know
*  I mean there must be something really wonderful to it just maybe lacking the defense to stop us
*  Well, it didn't you know, it didn't work like their magic didn't protect them from the white settlers
*  But there was something about the belief in that magic. Well only the last group of them. Yeah, it did everyone else before
*  You know, I mean all things must come to an end and cycle out
*  I think well what really got him was disease
*  They said that disease killed somewhere in the neighborhood of 90% of the Native Americans, which is just incredible
*  And that's also the Aztecs
*  It's a lot of civilizations that encounter these dirty Europeans. Yeah, have you ever been to Teotihuacan?
*  No, I've never been there. I heard it's amazing though
*  something really interesting happened to me there now when I that
*  Not only is this square that we went to and stand on this earth mound and this guy whose nickname was gorilla giving us this
*  wonderful tour of just a spot
*  The most romantic tour ever of this place if you're such a rough place and he goes wait right here
*  and we're in this giant square and
*  He runs down this dirt mound about I don't know say 150 feet away 200 feet away and he goes
*  It was like oh my god, I could hear him
*  He goes this square was built with these mounds here to be able to speak at this voice to 250,000 people
*  Whoa, and I was like what and then we walk and yeah right there. Is that it up there? Yes
*  Well, it's okay. It's that way and then go left. You could look this way so you don't have to look backwards
*  Yeah
*  So so if we were to see that square if we were to go straight around that pyramid and make a left
*  That's where those mounds are and and the other thing is and these that's the same shot from a different angle
*  That's near where these high these shaman lift
*  The shaman had quarters like an area of this place and there was this there's these
*  Sort of things and I said what are these and they said they're reflection ponds
*  I said, oh like for like reflecting and he goes no
*  For reflecting and I'd never considered that you don't look at the stars by going
*  But that really you look down and you mark so in seven years when it comes around again, you're like, ah pattern
*  Cuz I'm always like, how do you look up and learn a pattern of that? Right, right, right, but by looking down
*  Well, that's crazy. So they had ponds just to look at the reflection of the stars and map them out
*  Yeah, the shaman did that was like in their neighborhood and if you the way we were shown is if you had a birthmark on
*  Your head when you were born they immediate were like two boards rope and just put two boards and rope to and began a lifetime
*  Of of like so you're a shaman
*  Which if you had a lifetime of that you'd be like hi shaman
*  Shot. Hey shaman. I mean if so it's like being born a royal
*  He's the shaman don't squeeze the show even more weird right because you don't have a history or a bloodline of it
*  Study of what we are and that that is significant
*  Mm-hmm, because I felt to me immediately like well, everyone can't do that. We need
*  You know, you don't have a thing on you. So yeah, if you don't have the birthmark. Yeah, I mean that's a really good
*  Like entry, you know at the gate, you know, that's the case with a Dalai Lama, too
*  I think they found him when he was I want to say he was nine
*  How old was the Dalai Lama when they found him, but they just decided oh, you're a reincarnated holy man
*  And so you don't ever again. I know but can you imagine being nine and you're just like have two toys and like, huh?
*  Yeah, this is the house you don't have to work but no pussy ever what what are you talking about? I'd be like mom
*  These things they say I'm you don't know what you're missing yet
*  Before you know, it's just a weird choice that and then people look to him like there's something incredibly special about him
*  Right. He's the Dalai Lama, but it's not like he went through this long
*  Sort of apprenticeship period where he meditated and then became the Dalai Lama or yell out of 20 meditators
*  You're like you were the quietest. Yeah, you're the best bro. You do we focus. No, he's fucking hey
*  Hey focus on me for a sec. I gotta get out of it. You know, how old was it? Does it say I?
*  think he might have been
*  Almost I think he was a little bit over 15
*  Really see that seems like a rough one. Yeah, I'm trying to read on it
*  Took him four years before he actually took the power of the Dalai Lama. Oh, so he'd had
*  He was so young he kept dropping it
*  They're like Gary get over here either way he was this oh, do you know who else is a reincarnated holy person?
*  Steven Seagal
*  Well, duh, they read they they've decided one day. Oh you you must be some spiritual creature from another life
*  Well, that actually sounds it right that's a fairly good description of him
*  You're a creature your physical creature from another life
*  But that's yeah, there it is in
*  1997 Lamar pen or Rin poche from pay Pal Yule
*  monastery announced the cigar was a tolku and
*  specifically the reincarnation of
*  Chung drag Dorje a 17th century turtan that's not as a treasure revealer
*  That sounded like me reading in the fifth grade. It seems like it to lam poor pen Rin poche from Palio
*  Pal how many times you think that got him laid?
*  Twice three at least three. Well, no, he's got one in each hand
*  There's gotta be someone that had sex with him because they really thought that he was a reincarnated holy man
*  Maybe like someone from another country didn't understand him. Well, maybe it was llama pen or Rin poche from the Palio
*  monastery
*  The only way to pass this on to you. I mean someone is anal he tricked somebody
*  That's incredible I wonder how many people that works as an expression for
*  versus the amount of people that are like
*  What do you want on your sandwich? You know, like he's like, well, I'm a magical being and it's like would you just order your food?
*  When you went to that
*  The Aztec temple as a musician when you're sitting there
*  Did you like did it make sense like the acoustics like the way it's set up does the way the sound works?
*  Does it make sense to you like I really constructed it?
*  It left a very lasting
*  feeling of
*  That we're supposed to be here and that
*  You know
*  It just it really restored a lot of faith in humanity
*  I didn't focus on the ritualistic murder that was going on there. It was just the
*  that's the one set of people the other set of people built this and they know and they knew and
*  you know much like
*  The Great Pyramids that are really, you know in the shape of Orion's belt exactly that same
*  Concept of like what's going on here matters. And if that is your focus
*  Think of how wonderful it can be, you know, like how did those people know how to make that with no
*  Without the you know, they say without the wheel
*  That would be like really hard seems insane. Yeah, the Aztecs didn't have the wheel right?
*  allegedly
*  Yeah, how the fuck did they do all that?
*  Well, at least the way they did it physically you can kind of like that
*  We know that they they murdered
*  80,000 slaves in a period of just a few days after the construction of that temple. Yeah, so that was like
*  Don't tell me actually don't worry about it. I'll take care of it. I think they were gonna be slaughtered
*  I think it was kind of like part of the gig
*  Yeah, well, I maybe that wrong with that. I might be wrong about that. Well, I
*  It doesn't with that many people it wouldn't sound surprising that you'd have some cooperation. I
*  Mean it's hard to imagine 80,000 people at once going sorry what and not be like well fuck this man
*  Yeah, that sounds like a cooperative event to me somehow unless they were somehow or another locked up and they brought them out one by one
*  That's an awfully big cage. You've got there. Yeah, it isn't yeah 80,000. That's quite an arena
*  Yeah, yeah, they could have to build an extra one of those just to hold them. Yeah, that's like a giant football arena
*  It's that big. Yeah, it's that big and and
*  That what struck me as just
*  Because I play music as I thought
*  Okay, that means these acoustics are so perfect like who's how do you discover that are you in a canyon and while this sounds
*  Can you hear me over there and and then you sort of?
*  triangulate and
*  Start doing the geometry for how that works and like quick someone in venture on but geometry first though cuz I don't know
*  It's I mean, how does that?
*  You know how manifest itself that understanding yeah
*  How many thousands of years did it take before they figured out how to construct something?
*  Yeah, we're someone on their deathbed is like wait one last thing I got about acoustics sound kind of bounces off shit
*  You've got to be shaped like this. Yeah, but the Pythagorean theorem
*  I you know, I've never been to any of the Aztec temples, but I went to Chichen Itza
*  I saw some of the Mayan temples and it just there whenever you're at a place like that. That's just
*  Magical that's so fucking old and so amazingly constructed you just think what the fuck was it like to live back then?
*  Like do we have a terrible idea of what they were like, of course
*  Yeah, we don't know well, but it sort of dawned on me at some point
*  There was like oh you mean the people that wrote our history was wrote it as from the perspective of by the way
*  We're way better way better. But okay. Here's the story of these other people. Yeah, right
*  Like by some kind of dickhead winner, right right right a dickhead winner with guns
*  Yeah, like before we get started I'm better than the person I'm gonna tell you about
*  Yeah, we can't even though we can't do what they did because what is the emotion when you when you're in that space?
*  I'm trying I'm trying to think of the right
*  Word to describe how I felt there right and I guess all right. Yeah, it's it really is it is all but also
*  there's a there's almost yeah reverence and there's almost like a
*  Some strange gratitude. Yeah, like where you're like, thank you for I'm so thankful to be part of this even just by
*  Living in the time just to appreciate this. Yeah. Yeah, it there feels it soaks
*  It feels like knowledge expanding that I I don't have so I just feel like oh if I could have a piece of that if I
*  Could understand a piece of that but just standing there is sort of understanding it, right?
*  We have such an egotistical perspective when it comes to our personal civilization that we that like this with the internet with cars and with
*  Planes and all that this is the best way to there's a word for it. I can't what are can you try to find such a thing?
*  Please
*  What is the word? I know there's a word for the word
*  Definition is to believe that the era you're in is the finest of them all. Yeah
*  Up to this point, I think yeah, I've heard that word and I know what you're saying that isn't it's some kind of dickhead syndrome
*  Exactly certainly was created by a man. There's some guys like do this. Yeah. Yeah, I don't think it was a girl
*  If it was she was like one of them
*  alright
*  Don't you wish that there was like a supportive mother was like yeah sure honey. You're the best too. This is the best
*  Yeah, number one. Just leave don't worry about him. It's yeah, don't worry about him guys. He's fine
*  You're the best. Yeah
*  It's like the same thing with the Native Americans and the the settlers that the settlers were imposing their lifestyle
*  But the people that experienced the Native American lifestyle they wanted to stay living like that for sure
*  Well, I think because it omitted some of so many of the things that the European culture was bringing
*  Yes, and and and I you can it seems like like a distinct possibility that the European perspective
*  Like when Pizarro and all that, you know was a 12 of them conki stores killed like a thousand
*  natives in a matter of hours
*  When you know when they land they're looking for gold everywhere
*  right right at first they have this this belief that something big will come across the water and be their god and here comes a
*  ship with a bunch of dirty assholes that
*  literally factually dirty assholes have ridden across the boat and and
*  You know, I think about that perspective where they obviously were like these people are nice
*  But I've had enough of this they should have invented ships were better. So let's kill everyone here. Yeah
*  That's what I mean Cortez. Yeah Cortez. That's what it is. Yeah. Yeah, they didn't know what was going on because I don't think that
*  Previous to that time they'd ever seen anyone on a horse before no and and
*  Come across you imagine a big boat and then a few horses where they're like what the fuck is yeah
*  Gary come over and look at this. It's just it's impossible to found a man riding a beast
*  They're probably what in the fuck with like rusty armor from being on a fucking boat for months. Yeah, like looking like shit
*  being desperately like
*  like
*  the I imagine their relief when they come up on these horses with this armor and all this stuff and they're like
*  They're cool
*  This is gonna be easy, you know, I mean at first they they must have thought maybe we could do this with some goodwill
*  but quickly it's like
*  You guys are too primitive. We're just gonna take over here. I doubt they even thought they were gonna do it with goodwill
*  I don't think there was any goodwill back then. I think people were just murdering people you think that there's perhaps
*  That more people took more lives in a way like for per capita or something
*  I think that it was a more brutal way of taking lives
*  I'm sure people take more lives today in war but I think I don't act and it was just it was hands-on
*  right, but
*  It seems like more percentage of the people that alive had an opportunity or the possibility to kill someone. Yes today
*  Yeah, too. So it's like if you if you are with
*  150 people all of which have killed at least three people, right?
*  That's an interesting group and then you land on a boat
*  You've been there for months
*  You're like maybe maybe you are like we got to kill somebody and rape something and take something as quick as possible
*  And you have no idea what the fuck they're saying because you can't speak their language
*  So it's easy to just and they're being nice. So you're like they're gonna fuck these people up and five four three
*  like silent count off
*  It's bizarre. Well, that's the history of mankind is men showing up in boats and
*  Killing everybody that they met and then kind of doing their own version of a selfie on the dead body. Yeah
*  Right getting this side. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah have draw me
*  I would imagine what it would be like if you could be a fly on the wall when Montezuma met Cortez
*  Just to be there and see what that was like when these people who had never encountered
*  Spaniards before and these guys show up in these boats with two absolutely different beliefs
*  And perspectives of what's about to go down what's crazy is that is why Mexico speaks Spanish
*  Yeah, and people don't get that in their head like oh Mexican. It's why all of South America except for Brazil
*  Brazil is Portuguese. You know, yeah, maybe we don't get that in our head like Mexico speak Spanish
*  Why do these and has horses? Yeah, Spain's way the fuck over there. How how is where they speak Spanish? Yeah
*  Like it's it makes no fucking sense, but then you realize like oh my god, they were conquered by the Spaniards. Whoa
*  yeah, and a long long time ago in time ago long fuck because I
*  because of having a my music teacher as a young boy drill the song in
*  1492 from Spain through wind and storm in gay the Nina the pinta the scent that
*  1492 1492 which is which
*  By my watch is a long time ago
*  It is it is but it's not you know
*  Like I had a joke in my act about the United States being founded at 1776 people live to be a hundred
*  That's three people ago
*  That's real though, I know it sounds fucked up when you hear you funny yeah when you hear it it sounds like you see right
*  Well, that's not right. Well, what's funny is that's totally true. Yeah, it is right. I mean, that's yeah
*  Yeah, yeah
*  That's right. The thing is anything that happens before you were born seems like a million years ago, of course
*  I know but also 1776 seems like yesterday to me. I wasn't alive and I'm ready to admit that but I
*  That seems like oh that is just very fucking super recent. Yeah, I mean
*  Do you think it's possible that a new nation gets started? Is it too late?
*  Because like the reason why the United States got started because everybody hated how
*  Suppressive European civilization was so like we should wait till you see how we do it. Yeah, we're gonna fix this
*  Yeah in some ways we have right it's better in some ways than it in some ways in some ways we did more freedom
*  There's some ways. Yeah, we didn't yeah. Yeah, it's like what humans do we no one ever nails anything
*  It's just everything's messy. It's always complicated especially more people. Yeah, because anyone that's been to a family
*  Family reunion is like has said oh fucking Gary really?
*  Yeah, you know then also like the different
*  Environments that people live in sort of dictate their personality. You're a desert guy, right? Yeah, you're from the desert
*  Yeah, what is that? That's a scorpion. I'm one of the few people I know that's been bit by one. Have you really?
*  yeah, and as I I
*  Was going up to Joshua tree to this studio. That's really just a house
*  And was that the one that the guys showed in the thing you did with Bourdain? Yeah. Yeah
*  Uh-huh Rancho de la Luna. Yeah, and um
*  But its magic is is what's missing and I mean everywhere every but
*  And all that's left is like what if you just when the tide receded it was just the idiosyncratic and
*  the previously thrown away
*  Like all in reborn and you know, it's just got that sort of feeling to it, right? So
*  And so I was driving up there and I know I'm a desert boy. I know that you're not supposed to
*  At night times when everything comes out, right because in the day everyone is like, oh really?
*  I mean everything that walks or crawls is like
*  And so at night everyone everything that walks or crawls goes. All right, let's go right and
*  So you wear shoes if you do not wear shoes
*  You're it's you you have made a mistake for sure and as soon as we pull up to the Rancho in the dirt parking lot
*  I open up I
*  Open up the door and I'm on the passenger side and I step out and
*  I go into reach for a 12 pack of beer and
*  Something hit me on the foot and I was like and I lift my foot and there's this black
*  Dark brownish like a rootbeery Brown's scorpion hanging from my foot going. Hey, hey, hey, hey
*  Hey, and I was like, I I think
*  it was like
*  Like a really butch gal
*  Who's been terrified for the first time like right and I slapped it
*  Oh, and I slapped it off my foot because that's my knee-jerk reaction and I as I did that
*  That's when I screamed and jumped like, you know
*  Like a mouse or something in the car and in the door light of this
*  In the door light this scorpion hit the ground like shuffled itself turned and came right at me
*  Whoa and was sort of like fuck you wait to I it scared me
*  It scared me to death came back at you. You imagine being that little wanting to fuck up something as big as you well
*  You'd have to right you'd have it wouldn't be there would be no bravado at all would be like
*  Yeah, like it would be it would be a true believer right that in that moment
*  I'm like fuck this thing and it is a hundred percent sure
*  It's gonna fuck me up and it was right because what am I gonna do?
*  Like I'm gonna hit this stinger with my hands. I just know what was the pain like
*  Well at that time my understanding of scorpions was in our desert mojave. There's two types and
*  One which is like, you know
*  24 hours of central nervous system shut down so they can't even give you anything for the pain
*  because the thing that's the regulates act gets like turn turned off or and so you're just like
*  24 hours you're in pain. That's that was my knowledge at that time and the other one is akin to a beast thing
*  So when did you get well I had to like track back
*  this was before the internet and so I go inside and
*  The remedy at that time as as Fred Drake who rest in peace
*  Told me it was to drink Jack Daniels and put your foot in a bucket of hot like burning hot water
*  Which is is a little bit like having a horse on each leg and they take off a different direction
*  Because I get the hottest water you can take and continue the pain
*  Like it's that it's such a wives tale. It's almost like a divorcees tale or something. It's like
*  So I did that and waited because I didn't know which one it was it turns out that
*  The 24 hours one is lives in another desert and more close to Arizona and that it's not quite as as I've described
*  I'm just telling you what I thought
*  And and it was much like a bee sting, but by the time I I realized that and it's swole up. It's swole up
*  Immediate and looked like it was gonna keep going because it got to this golf ball so fast
*  That it was like when will this stop? Right, right? But it was like a bee sting, but by the time I've discovered that I was so drunk
*  That bee stings me stings, you know
*  So
*  You're just sitting there with your foot in a bucket of hot water getting scalding
*  Like it was like the hotter it is the better and I was like, ah
*  Don't dump it. Imagine if the fucking real injury was you got third-degree burns in your foot
*  Oh water and there was nothing wrong with the bee
*  How mad would you be my friend said you should the real remedy is you grab a shark and you?
*  And you totally forget about a buddy mine was in South America and he got bit by a bullet ant
*  He got hit by a bullet ant on his heel and he said it was he said the pain was so bad
*  But it was so bewildering that after the pain was over. He couldn't figure out which foot got bit
*  We because your brains going
*  It's static. He said you're it's so confusing the pain so confusing
*  For hours, do you think that because anytime I've seen that online where it's like, you know, you know
*  I'm dingo piles and I'm a bullet ant by like Jesus man. Don't hang out with this person
*  We see no one with a glove. Yeah, like a handful they pull the yeah
*  It's like a ritual that young men have to do to reach the Ryan coming. Oh, that's right. Yeah
*  That's like jumping off on how bungee was invented with no bunch or no boy
*  No, this is rope thunk to be a man you jump off this thing and it's like I'm starting to identify as a
*  Yeah, I I wonder what the bullet ant thinks of all this if it's like no I can never make any friends
*  What the fuck I think they're just violence in insect form
*  Don't you don't you think that that's if there ever was an alien that would be it would be easy to assume this little bullet
*  ant in space that's just like
*  and then
*  Pushes so hard that there's two of them
*  Will really be fucked up is bugs were big and intelligent if bugs behaved the way
*  Settlers behaved when they encountered the Native Americans
*  I must say I'm happy to hear you say that something I say to my kids and I've said to myself for many many many years
*  Is
*  When I'm having a rough morning, I say thank God praying mantis aren't five feet fuck
*  Yeah, dude, because getting to your car would be a nightmare
*  Yeah, and and you'd never they'd just be like
*  You know that yeah, I was just watching a video of a praying man is fucking up a mouse
*  They're so powerful man. It's crazy. This is just to like start the morning. It was just sitting there
*  I was just sitting there as a mouse got close to him and he grabbed a hold of all is that a normal way to
*  Start the morning is me. Yeah
*  Unfortunately, yeah, there was one with a squirrel too. It was the praying mantis was eating a squirrel
*  It's like holding on to this little squirrel's head and just slowly pulling it apart
*  Oh, there's another one with a lizard. The lizard one was pretty fucked. Look at this mouse. You would think well, there's no way
*  Look that mouse is just like oh well just going over here. Just gonna look over here, bro
*  They're so ruthless these goddamn things and they're so fucking deceptively strong for their size
*  You look at how big they are. I mean look at that dude. If that was five feet tall
*  Oh, we'd be fucked. I I wouldn't I honestly I would stay home and a lot more
*  I would be armed to the dick. I say just fucking everywhere I go multiple guns
*  Kevlar suit here he goes bitch and the way they get some it's so fucking fast
*  Well, it is a kind of a cool thing that we don't have to like die watching something eat us
*  It's crazy though that there's no it's not a contest. It's not that in the ear though. That's I
*  Want to first what I'd like to move is that that's not that's uncalled for it's rude
*  Yeah, you know eating him ear first if I'm hit by something that's gonna eat me
*  I'm like don't start at the fucking ear man. They don't give a fuck
*  Well, it's really that's what you got to hear the mouse. Did you make it any louder?
*  Will you get in deep enough place you get this over with fuck and then you just feel the sound at that point
*  Yeah, like boulders underwater looks like big
*  It's just crazy when you look at how big the mouse is and how small the insect is like for mass of body weight
*  That it's not even a contest that the praying mantis just gets it
*  100% like it's not like maybe the mouse can get away like no it's over bit
*  It's a bit like that orca eats the great whites liver thing, right?
*  Right. Yeah, we're for for for like a thousand nautical miles in every direction every single tagged white shark
*  As soon as that happens the radius is like a thousand nautical miles every great white shark was like so anyways
*  They thought I'm out of here and then takes off really. Yeah, so they felt it like they knew yeah something about the smell of their own
*  that
*  Really or whatever that you know
*  What is it the opulive little Lorenzini that that's set sixth sense they have? Oh, right
*  Okay, something about that frequency for them is sort of like call you back
*  And they just bail well
*  That's like the bully getting bullied right like they're the meanest motherfuckers in the ocean except for the orcas, right?
*  I think at this point in my life. I'm like they don't have hands so they're like sorry. I got to try it
*  What's going on here? No hands gonna use this. Sorry
*  Because when you when you have no predators most of your time like that. What's up, Jamie?
*  We got we mentioned this before where they only go after the liver. Oh, yeah, creepy
*  Well, they do some some father father beans with it so that's cool, it's probably very nutritious
*  But they are you kidding orcas of the big do that with your mouth
*  I think orcas are probably the biggest dick of all because they're just like
*  Should we go fuck with that guy and grab liver? What do you want to do? Well, they fuck up dolphins, too
*  We know dolphins are kind of cute. Well, I'm big dolphins. Well the the permanent smile, right? That's a dolphin circuit
*  They're just thinking hey because it could be like fuck you
*  Well, even dolphins dolphins commit
*  Infantricide they kill babies. They do it on porpoise. Yeah
*  Well, they killed their own to kinds babies to try to force the female into estrus and so as a consequence
*  Well, you know, oh right to get them back
*  Yeah
*  fertility because female dolphins when they breed apparently once they have a baby they they have to
*  Raise that baby for like six years so they won't have sex for like six years
*  So what male dolphins do is they will kill the baby so the force to female to breed again
*  So what females do is they become hoes so they fuck everybody and anybody they can so that if a dolphin runs into her
*  They go. Maybe that's my kid. Oh, right. Yeah, so they're not sure if it's their kid
*  They don't even obviously there's no 23 plausible ability. Yeah
*  So they know that they fucked her like the seven great oceans in me or something
*  Well, they're really intelligent right? I mean they have a cerebral cortex. That's 40% larger than a human beings one when when
*  There was that one shot and maybe it's blackfish or something like that
*  Where they put a mirror up and the dolphins are like going looking at them. They're self-aware. They're
*  like the
*  That was an amazing moment to watch like a dolphin go. Oh
*  Yeah, like with a shower with a hairbrush singing in the mirror sort of well again
*  It's like the way we looked at other cultures
*  We we think we're better
*  But when we look at orcas and dolphins just because they can't affect their environment the way we can like they can't build houses
*  And you know and create things. Yeah, we assume they're not as intelligent
*  We'll create things that we we would determine to have any value right right physical objects
*  That's it. But but the way they have culture and communication and but also yeah that to have the sonar and all that stuff
*  They're they're operating with tools that were like what? Yeah, we don't even understand what you're doing
*  Oh, you mean Bing I got that over here Bing
*  It's like they're using sonar and finding objects in the water and also as in fish as a musician
*  I at one point I I went through this pirate phase of reading where you just read about because all the logs are so
*  Accurate they had to be to survive. So you have pirates logs
*  Yeah, like well, um the historical version of why did someone why did someone turn into a privateer?
*  You know charged by the king of Spain to take anything English into the English
*  It's a pirate and that like how does that and it was from war slowing down and all these sailors having like what do we do?
*  Oh, you know and the logs are so accurate and and in a very fact
*  Like this is what happened. It's marked in the log
*  That is just great accurate history of the Caribbean
*  Well, there's one of the ways we know about what happened with Columbus, right? One of the one of the more
*  Fucked up things about Columbus's I believe it was a missionaries that traveled with him that ratted him out about how ruthless they were
*  Yeah, they were cutting people's arms off
*  They get him didn't give him enough gold and dashing babies heads on but then you wouldn't be able to get
*  Any more gold from that person certainly just yeah, the idea was enough
*  What he else but if you didn't bring enough as a practical thing like go get me more gold, you know
*  Cut his arm up. Well now I can't even bring more anyways
*  I think the idea was nobody wants their arm cut off. So there's plenty of them
*  Yeah, like just kill this one guy and the people that do want their only have one arm. They probably have already done that
*  Yeah, they're probably fucked up that
*  The reason for the the logs is they would talk about how whales and dolphins you could hear them singing
*  Mmm, because there's no engines on the ocean
*  so it's just
*  Just the silence of the planet right right just that they're just using sails
*  Yeah, and and and sometimes there isn't any wind and it's night
*  Where everything comes out to do its thing and you'd hear this communication this vast whale song that you could hear around the world
*  Wow, because the whales are so big and
*  that there's this communication and that they're and how they
*  Extrapolating that there's a communication breakdown now because of the noise pollution of it all
*  Oh sure noise pollution and regular pollution as well, right? Right?
*  Yeah, the constant drone of success. Yeah, you know, I mean that's that's where the real
*  Horrific death has occurred right in the ocean. Imagine what the ocean was like in terms of like teeming with life in 1492
*  Yeah, I mean, yeah because they talk about that trash
*  Thing that really was a it was nutrients before that's why the animals came there, you know, you know
*  But they you know, there's a trash plastic island the size of Texas
*  yeah, yeah, but it all gathers there because of the currents and
*  Previously it wasn't an island of plastic but in fact an island of nutrients that brought everything in
*  So it was like hometown buffet
*  For fish things and right right now they're showing up and they're like
*  You know what I mean, yeah, how's the six-pack ring look on me? Yeah
*  Bummer it's a fucking bummer. Yeah. What's up, Jerry?
*  Did you see what you know Colin O'Brady who was on the podcast a few months ago now? Yeah
*  He's gonna row across from Antarctica Drake's Passage. I guess is what it's called in this little teeny rowboat. Oh Jesus
*  He's crazy a couple other guys he's gonna do it with but he walked across Antarctica
*  Yeah
*  story, how do they really it I
*  Can't imagine it not being fraught at every other's footstep
*  I bet you do that though for like however long it takes him a summer rowing you come out ripped
*  I bet you get developed serious back muscles. Yeah
*  Yeah, yeah, you know that is a really positive way to look at it
*  It's a great work. So if you want to do stay do you want bigger back?
*  You want your back to look beautiful?
*  Okay, the crew must roll with me four hours a day rotating around the clock with little to no sleep. What?
*  Yeah, they're live-streaming this whole thing with
*  Die we're gonna watch it bro
*  I just swells can tower up to 50 feet high. What the fuck man imagine it's so crazy. It sounds so fucking crazy
*  Well, imagine it's to like
*  27 in the morning
*  Yeah, and everyone's asleep and you're in charge of rowing over 50 foot swells and how much can you sleep if everybody has to work?
*  24 hours a day. What do you get like an hour sleep a day? Well, you get tons of fake sleep
*  There's the because it's tired of rowing you're in the zone
*  Look at this fucking boat, too. It's a shitty little boat. Can you imagine being the cameraman?
*  That's the most boring thing ever on that. Did you see that cameraman on the back? Oh, that's ridiculous. He's got a row too, though
*  There's no one who's just a cameraman
*  six athletes it says
*  one boat
*  No chance no motor
*  They're fucked. Yeah. Yeah, no sail. Oh god
*  Why do people have to do things like this? No turning back. I love talking to them when they come back
*  But why do they have to do that?
*  It just seems so ridiculous good luck the impossible row follow
*  I wonder how you sell that idea to like the other rower
*  Bunch of crazy assholes get together I was thinking about running a thousand miles. Well, hey before you do that, I got a project
*  Yeah, it doesn't start with like hear me out. Just hear me out
*  Let me finish the pitch and then like do you have to?
*  Predecess that like that. Yeah, you just gently try to I
*  Think those kind of I don't know what you have to yeah, certainly there
*  They're near the ore store or whatever the fuck there are some people out there that just can't push themselves hard enough
*  You know no matter what happens like like my friend David Goggins. He ran this Moab 240
*  It's a 240 mile race through the desert
*  he
*  developed pulmonary edema
*  Which I guess you get at high altitudes when you're exerting yourself
*  Yeah that Everest like crazy shit, right? So he goes to the hospital. They treat him
*  He gets back and finishes the race
*  So he ran another 80 miles after he ran a hundred and eighty plus with fucking pulmonary edema like what?
*  Well, but does that mean that when you get done that you're like good. Okay. No, he didn't give a fuck
*  I mean, it's not really in the end days. There's no end with that guy that that's
*  It's there's no destination at all. There's no finish line. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
*  It's just like break to take a leak as close the thing is they know they all know there's other people like them out there
*  So it's like they're at the same race. Yeah, not even just that. It's just that they're all connected
*  But from the internet, you know, they're all connected through the circles that they travel in they're connected through just but they follow
*  Other people like them online
*  But do you think that a drive like that is more an internal one or do you think that the competition of seeing what someone else did?
*  Is is a what kind of factor do you think that I think they're both?
*  Play a factor. It's it's other people that are pushing it
*  They make you realize that it's possible and then it's other it's you you also have some sort of insane internal furnace
*  Yeah
*  Well there I believe when they did some brain testing on that climber fella that did the
*  Alex Honnold. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah that he just didn't trip out as it took a lot more to freak him out
*  Oh, yeah, I'm sure that the his brainwaves were like, yeah. No, I'm cool. Like when you're hanging by one toenail upside down
*  Do you even talk about him makes me nervous? I've had him on twice shots. Yeah. Oh my god
*  I I shouldn't someone else's pants. I get so scared
*  Yeah
*  Those are great on you. Let me try them on and then like hey go
*  Sometimes it's not even a lot of down. Sometimes it's an angle back
*  Yeah, like yeah like 15 degrees back the wrong direction
*  I do just watch that and get vertigo where your balls are sort of like I look at this
*  We don't I can grow that that's way more than 15 degrees. How many degrees is that if you had a guess?
*  45 that's like 45 degrees, right? Yeah, so that is definitely and he's 45 degrees
*  thousand feet up in the sky
*  Do you have to my palms are sweaty? Yeah, my sweat like crazy. Do you have to fill that?
*  Couldn't tell if that's yours or mine
*  Instantaneous palm sweat we need to drink Pirell now
*  I
*  Just let our hands on fire
*  Put our hands in the same bucket of water. Are you for the scorpion?
*  You know right and ride a motorcycle like I try to stay focused and right very now right in the moment
*  Yeah, because it's a requirement like when you're sort of like did I leave the iron on?
*  That's whenever I've gotten in like a little fender bender or right right, of course, you know and but in that
*  There is no you do. Do you have to stay so in it that there is no out or I think so
*  Can you let yourself drift and like almost like a meditative state and just be like hands?
*  I don't think you can I think if you drift you're fucked. I mean, I think first of all, so how do you stop things?
*  Well, then how do you stop things like, you know, guess who's hungry hands up? Oh shit
*  You know, I mean, I think he does it so often that he knows how to get into that state
*  But you know, there's also like look at that little thing go that back data. Just believe look at that little thing
*  He's holding on with his left hand. What's to say that doesn't chip loose
*  What's the say? What's the say?
*  I mean some of these rocks this talk about manifesting that you do it talk about saying
*  Guess you know, it's already done. You'd have to say it's already done. I don't know what I think
*  You just got to go left foot right foot right hand left hand
*  And then you also have done it many times with ropes
*  But also on when you're on the ground you're like want to hang out and he's like, oh bro. That looks like
*  60 degrees
*  That's insane. He's like basically hanging upside down
*  Climbing so far above the fucking trees on purpose on purpose like like it's Tuesday there
*  You know what I mean? Most people you and me included would be dead. We wouldn't be able to do what he's doing
*  I'd be dead of a heart attack on the from realizing I was gonna try and he's such a mellow guy, too
*  That's what's really interesting. Yeah, like look at that smile. That's that's it's like
*  He also just started recently getting injured
*  Right, I saw that thing. Yeah
*  Moving I tell you what though. I will read or watch anything about Everest or climbing or I don't know if there's something
*  Cuz I'm always like well gonna go for that metaphorically
*  That you know, but metaphorically yeah, like I'm gonna take that
*  Metaphor that energy and put it into the car and put it into something else
*  Like yeah, I don't know pass those chips over here like I the way I eat
*  Yeah, I eat the way those climbers risk their lives see that Sunday over there I'm gonna climb that thing
*  It's just knowing that someone like that is out there though
*  It changes what our our expectations are like what what we think of as the the boundaries of human performance
*  What someone's capable of doing? Well, it's certain. It's certainly there's a weird
*  Epiphany when you're watching someone do that. Yeah, because you're sort of like
*  I'm doing the exact opposite of this person that I'm watching. Yeah, you're just sitting there
*  You're like not risking anything. Oh, yeah, you're just sort of like thank you for doing this for my pleasure
*  There's a there's a moment of disconnect for me when I when I'm like
*  I'm going on a hike. I can't finish this movie anymore, you know
*  I'm not supposed to finish this movie
*  It's it's interesting because what he's doing is essentially a spectator sport, but there's no audience until after it's done
*  right, so it so it ultimately for the
*  For the climb must be singularly about you
*  I mean it must be the I don't know how you how you include someone else during that no thing
*  I think it's just all about the moment
*  I think he's just like I said
*  I think he's thinking left foot right foot right hand left hand and he just you just keep going and you know the path
*  Well, then that would be akin to so, you know some of the greatest meditative minds that have ever existed
*  Yeah, oh, it's gotta be because it's one thing to meditate and position and and kind of go deeply within and keep
*  Going into the depths which are vast right?
*  But but it's different if you said now you get up and climb this thing, please
*  Yeah, there would be a certain amount of no. No, I'm still meditating
*  I'm not gonna do that right where you might be like no, I'm doing this this so I don't have to do that
*  Right to maintain that mindset through action. That's a different kind of meditation because the consequences are so grave
*  Like if you're just sitting there meditating and your brain drifts nothing happens
*  But if you're up there and you're achieving that state and then your brain drifts and you're like, oh Jesus what the fuck am I doing?
*  Oh my god, I've been reading about this. I've been watching and reading this woman Esther Hicks. Oh, yeah. Okay. This is that lady that channels
*  Yeah, but but
*  putting that
*  aside to not
*  Precondition anyone her her discussions on
*  Manifestation and
*  her explanation of that that the physical body that you have thoughts and thoughts are bigger than
*  Your body is simply a bag that holds your protects your thoughts so they can occur
*  Yeah
*  And that when you think something you you begin to bring it into idea which is on the process to bring it into the world
*  Yeah, and so when you say I can't
*  you certainly cannot right and and
*  That it's okay when coming from a position of I can and it's already happened and I'm just
*  Meeting up with what's already occurred. Yeah that there's something beautiful there, especially when it's not
*  really being wrapped in a selfish thing but manifesting happiness and and things you love and that that attracts
*  Other that's what's contagious, you know
*  And
*  So I wonder when I see a photo like that about the connection of and her point point being is that she's like all day long
*  You're thinking thoughts and acting on them because the that mind and and body are one
*  They're executing the same process together, you know dependently and
*  like that is the embodiment of thought and
*  Body, you know action together and being ultimately in that vortex of being aware
*  That Esther Hicks lady is very strange
*  I'm very torn on that because I listened to the actual words and the things that she says when she's channeling that
*  What is it like Abraham? Is he like a dead guy or an alien? What is he? I forget what he is
*  I see I just channels an alien, right?
*  But I think there's multiple people but see the thing is is I've kind of like was listening
*  stumbled on that while I was driving and
*  Investigating or reconnecting with the law like the law of attraction. Yeah, and and how to like
*  it's like when you get your motorcycle lesson, they tell you to look through the turn because
*  You you tend to go where you're looking?
*  Mm-hmm, you know, not a lot of people are walking backwards and talking to you as they go forward, right? Of course and and so
*  That it sort of dawned on me the connection between just looking for something you love and not bonding or focusing on all the shit
*  you don't like as a manner of
*  Walking towards what what your desire, you know and and this kind of
*  Re-awakening with that concept is very just mere, you know three four weeks old for me
*  Really? Well returning to that idea because I had this idea this this concept before of like
*  Someone's got to make it why shouldn't it be why it's why couldn't be you?
*  Mm-hmm, let's let's
*  Let's let's go for it and really go for it
*  The only way to make it is to really honestly go let's so you're talking about like your band before you guys made it
*  No, I'm talking about a way of acting regarding anything. Okay, I love music and
*  and music has always been my way of of
*  Being the utmost honest I can be
*  and
*  I think because of that it's that's what's helped gravitate people that have stayed so long in that
*  however, also I've realized that
*  I put so much of who I really am in total into the music
*  that there are times that I should have done that and and
*  relationships with friends or
*  people it's like and family and and that it's really
*  It's important to do that in life, too
*  You know to be engaged yeah and also
*  Show your real self that kind of where the vulnerability of all that is really powerful instead of weakness
*  It's the opposite of weakness, you know, and and so I think I
*  think pursuing music that way is great, but not if it's keeping you from doing that in life and
*  So it's not just that I would think that way
*  So my band would do well it's that I would think that way so that I could I could do well
*  And I could be well, you know, right and
*  and
*  So that's why I started listening to her not seeing any of the opening gambit of of her
*  transforming into
*  Abraham Abraham and not caring and not understanding what that means just going like I'm just listening what you're saying while I'm driving right and
*  Hearing that and the way she speaks
*  Regarding those things is really fascinating
*  I I choose to detach myself from judgment. Yeah, because yeah, cuz I know one thing nothing
*  Well, it's it's it's it's weird because she's saying very wise things
*  Right, and but it would be a shame to get the just cuz I don't
*  That's not the rapper. I would pick that. I don't like the candy inside, right?
*  Yeah, the channeling part of it. Well, yeah, so it's not a oh, you mean it's not exactly how I would do it
*  Well, fuck this then well, it's not just that it's like you're listening to wisdom
*  But are you listening to wisdom from someone who's made up a fairy tale? That's where it gets confusing. It's well
*  She's channeling. Well, but I was she channel. Well, how's she doing?
*  I also think that to be able to learn something this this again this awakening and me is so new
*  Like it's in all honesty. It's it's like a month and a half old, but it feels really good. What happened?
*  It's just that you know, I
*  Think
*  That engagement in life, you know and also, you know feeling a bit lost and not knowing how to ask for
*  How to ask for help sometimes you know what I mean and and and not really knowing something exists at all you have feelings
*  That's a little too vague. But my point being that like
*  All the sudden engaging in something engaging in something that you're that you really love
*  Not focusing on the negative part of it, but really chasing after
*  That thing that which makes you feel good. So you've changed your perspective. Yeah, I focus on it. Absolutely. And in fact, and in fact
*  that I realized like
*  What sort of you know, it's fine. It's fine to be afraid of shit, you know, yeah, it's fine
*  It's not fine to go like nope. That's not not that's not over there. But right right to deny it
*  Yeah, how can you get stronger unless you turn them really really look into it? You know, right?
*  You don't want to be paralyzed by fear, but there's nothing wrong with being aware that something scares you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I really
*  Nine times out of ten you didn't need to be afraid of it
*  And that one time you do you know, it's true and you know what it is, right?
*  And and that seems like a successful and and in dealing with that too you get the chance to say
*  I
*  Can do this is that lady still alive is Esther Hicks still alive? I have no idea
*  Maybe I could get her in
*  I think I think it would be interesting because you'd have to separate the things that don't fit right, right?
*  Well, don't want the husband has to be there with everything to Jerry
*  Died as I listen
*  Without having no preconceived notion and just hearing this as I drive them in the next YouTube's things started playing
*  I was like, who is this? Who's Abraham? There's no there was no context for me
*  I was just listening to the words right and I was like wow, it's fucking great. Yeah, you know, this is great
*  And and kept listening. I was driving to the desert and doing this other stuff and you know what's interesting about it
*  It's remarkably consistent like it doesn't say anything that's really foolish and she never changes her tune right about
*  look, um, and I and I started to dig that she was saying we because
*  Until I understood that she was like channeling something. I thought it was just a really beautiful way of saying we
*  What we want to tell you is like as if you were already there, right?
*  And and really what she was talking about is already being there anyways
*  Like you will have an idea you will form a habit of one type or another which one would you like it to be?
*  mmm, and and um and
*  Know this if all you can focus is on what sucks but is yet to be just wait a sec. It's common
*  And and what where conversely if you were like I can worry about that because I like as much time without it as possible
*  Let's focus on something. I do like until shit gets here
*  Yeah
*  That you naturally look through the turn and as long as you're not trying to turn into a wall or a cavalcade of shit
*  Right, but if you're trying to turn into something you love you actually will turn into something you love in that case
*  you should probably embrace challenges, right you should probably welcome them because
*  when they happen they will test you and then you can figure out whether or not this philosophy is actually
*  Well, I mean I have been I have been I have been testing because you know, I've always like
*  dealt with difficulty by
*  Shielding it putting into the music or putting it into some dark closet somewhere
*  You know what I mean, right because that's just you're taught to do that, right? Yeah, like gnash your teeth and and grin and bare
*  Ignore it. Yeah, like that's what the rug is for sweeping stuff under right where you're like, oh really and
*  But that's feels like building a dam or something
*  To when really you're supposed to let that river of fear or whatever go with it go downstream with it
*  Stop fighting it. Yeah, cuz you damn all that shit up put it in the corner bury it behind and really one day it just like
*  gives you a massive bath of your fucked that damn brain whole law of attraction thing is very strange to me because I feel like
*  Everybody's trying to describe something that there's some element of truth to but that it's really complicated
*  And it's not as simple as think it and manifest it. There's a lot of
*  discipline involved in that there's a lot of hard work and concentration and thought and
*  Doubts and hopes and dreams and there's a lot of other things and then also fortune. Well, there's a lot of people
*  I feel like when those when it I I could never drink
*  I would never use that for fortune for me. The fortune would be like
*  That your
*  Relationships and emotional connections get deeper. Yeah, I don't mean for I mean being fortunate. Yeah
*  I mean being lucky like we're we're lucky. We're here. Well, we're blessed
*  We're here, but it's not really lucky and I think that's one of the main things right
*  there is understanding the difference in thought because ultimately what you're saying what one is that hard work that you're talking about and
*  all those things are are sort of getting out of your own way and
*  Unlearning how to say how to be so doubtful about it all and just say
*  I'll take I'll take something I like and I'll just think about that for a bit
*  Mm-hmm and and let that be the first step and then go
*  What do I keep going down that river downstream of that idea getting closer and closer to something you really love?
*  Because saying you know
*  Saying I don't like this water bottle
*  Sucks but but saying
*  But at least I don't have to drink it is one step away from that and if you just keep taking those steps away
*  And going down that river. That's the right direction to be going because focusing on this is like how's that gonna help you?
*  God, it's got this blue binding and it's well, it's certainly not gonna help you to
*  To think about how fortunate you are. Yeah, is it I mean, I guess it kind of is it's blocking you
*  Well, it's blocking you from feeling fortunate
*  But saying at least I don't have to drink them every day is turning the right direction and heading towards how fortunate you are
*  Mm-hmm
*  And if you keep taking those little direct that those steps then soon you get to like I feel fortunate to be here
*  Right. I feel fortunate. I don't have to think about this bottle of water all the time. That's quite nice genuine gratitude
*  Also, it clears your mind if you do have if you're thinking about positive things and working towards those things it clears your mind
*  of a lot of the
*  Just the the natural traps that we set for each other. Yeah, dumb nuts baggage
*  Those hurdles we make are tailor-made because they're made by you for you. Right, right. How could they not work?
*  Yeah, they highlight your actual real insecurities and fears that you know, you have that absolutely and you go
*  This is sure to trap someone because look up and then you're in it
*  Yeah, because you made it for you is like yeah to me to trap me and
*  And I think what I like about what I heard her saying is that because it came from no context whatsoever
*  And I just heard the words
*  It said can you get out of your own way? Yeah, that's what I'm would like you to think about first
*  What is that? There's an ancient tale the tale of two wolves meaning how to live your life
*  That like you yeah, I know one wolf is filled with fear
*  How does that go? My mother just gave just gave it to my kids
*  Really there how's it go? It's
*  paraphrasing
*  You know she bought this frame thing like, you know
*  there are two wolves and
*  one is anger and one is like love and
*  and and
*  They both exist but ultimately it's like which one you're gonna feed
*  Yeah, that it's it's really the I I think I'm correct in saying the something
*  You're paraphrasing but it's something like that's the one the one that survives and succeeds the one you feed well
*  They I think the younger
*  You know Native American says well, how do I how do I know which one?
*  How do I not let one take over and it's like well, which one are you gonna feed ultimately, right? Yeah, you know
*  Well, the more you concentrate on positive things and the less you concentrate on negative things for sure
*  You're freeing your mind up and you're you you gain the momentum of positive thought and the momentum of of
*  Living your life with positive thought it becomes easier to do right in the ward
*  Oh do I think but I think it's also necessary to say I'm not talking about walking around in colapse. You like going
*  right, just
*  Like
*  Smile yeah, you know what I mean nice and in action you're talking about this
*  Talking about this like in some sort of a random
*  Well, it starts with a thought it works into an idea and then manifests itself into like a smile or just
*  it's nice to
*  Do something nice and also understand that I'm not talking about walking around like hi
*  Yeah, you know like I'm not talking about being some goof tits dumb nuts motherfucker
*  That's what I'm saying is um, do something do something nice and start that way
*  Yeah, and leave it at that and I think there's something to
*  When you're when your thoughts are filled with this there's just frankly less room for me to think about this water
*  Which I dislike right just there's just frankly is less real estate
*  Right, you're using your real estate on positive things. Yeah, and and because the contagion of enjoying it
*  Of because things that are positive are essentially what things I like. Yeah, I'm enjoying being here
*  So this water doesn't really I don't have real estate for that, right?
*  I've got too much
*  enjoyment and to be here, you know and
*  And that'll do now this Esther Hicks thing. How did you get into this?
*  completely by accident or not
*  meaning meaning, you know, I
*  The just
*  Sometimes things just slam down on the table and say you've got to be engaged this at the moment to do do it or not
*  Right and
*  Nothing incites a change like that. That's it's sort of a gift actually
*  It's saying it's struggle now, but if you struggle through this it's gonna get better
*  you know and and I love I I
*  I'm actually really thankful and appreciative of that sort of moment. I don't mind the risk of all that
*  That's what it's all about. How'd you stumble upon it though? I just was like looking for like
*  Looking for through the law of attraction and and and finding a way to change
*  my thoughts to some two things I loved and I
*  Listened to a couple I was driving and it just clicked on to hers that autoplayed and there it was and as I said without
*  Any sort of judgment and I'm the last person that's kind of a joiner or would be accused of being hippie-dippies
*  whatever
*  like kind of like
*  Someone who's scared would say
*  So it just made sense to me almost the calculus of it all it's a complex problem
*  But get out of your own way keep it simple
*  Listen, but she goes further than that right? She she actually talks about your your thoughts
*  manifesting reality and she talks about how what you're doing with your thoughts in the way you think in the way you
*  Sort of interface with reality is you're creating reality with your mind, right?
*  Right and and I'm choosing
*  How I want to take that and and have that mean something to me
*  So you're finding an application for that in your life
*  And also I'm within the within the spectrum of all the things she's talking about. I simply am looking for ways to
*  In my immediate life with the people that are close to me
*  How to be more engaged and how to be more engaging myself
*  Because
*  I as I said
*  I've had a lot of troubled times in the last few years because of just feeling lost and not knowing how to
*  Deal with that and you always put that in your music
*  But maybe I should be putting it into more than just that too. It doesn't negate wanting to your music to be truth
*  Right. That's what it's for
*  But also I'm looking for ways to engage myself
*  That's what it's for
*  But also it should be inspiring to do point that in other directions, too
*  Are you bringing this to the band like if you said hey guys listen this channel here lady. No, no
*  No, because I mean I'm surprised I'm sort of revealing it here. It's a it's
*  Because I'm not a disciple of anything. Yeah, but it looks I don't think there's anything wrong with it
*  Honestly, cuz I mean I've listened to it too
*  Buddy mine was really into it and he turned me on to it and I listened to it
*  I said, okay, there's a lot of wacky shit going on here
*  It's like I think she's channeling a thousand year old person something like that. Yeah, Gary, but
*  Abraham right isn't that like I think she's supposedly channeling some absolutely. Yeah, but
*  Forget all that the words she's saying
*  Resonate and they're also sort of like consistent across this thing. Yeah, as I said before I'm I'm mining in a specific vein of like
*  Okay, the people I care about most
*  How do we how do we all grow right at each other?
*  And how do we do that right because that is the goal the goals into to be alone and it's also
*  Whether it's wacky or not look there's a lot of wacky shit and religion
*  But obviously a lot of people find some great meaning in it
*  You can this I don't know how much there's the world is weird and complicated
*  Yeah, absolutely get real wisdom from shit. That sounds like nonsense
*  well
*  if you reserve the right to be surprised by life if you really if you
*  To have an open mind you certainly have to unlock the door and open that fucker
*  That's a great way of looking at it reserve the right to be surprised by life that that is my goal in general and life and
*  also now it's my it's my mission because
*  it's a bit like
*  When I said like mess around with you know, illegals like the legal sub things that like that you drugs. Yeah. Oh
*  So I suppose those are in there too. Yeah, what'd you mean though?
*  I meant I meant that wrapped and other stuff. So I didn't have to just say that oh, but then I think I just gave that away
*  Okay. No
*  Those things those things are sort of like I tried all that for too long. Mm-hmm, and that didn't really go anywhere
*  So what else is there?
*  What else is going on? Right? So you tried drugs and then you're like well, there's got to be something else
*  That's gonna fill this void or give me some peace or yeah or like I certainly can't stand here
*  You're either growing or dying right since I'm less interested in dying. I'm like what else what else we got?
*  I mean, I think for a while was you know
*  my next thing is is
*  Well, it doesn't matter that I think what's important is when you said are you bringing this to the guys in the band I
*  Was just about to say yes until you said are you telling her about this lady because to me?
*  You
*  Bring in the lessons that you learn
*  Yeah
*  I'm like, oh my god
*  because I think I've always looked at music this way where it's like locks there have these
*  Concentric circles and at one point they all line up and you can see through the door to the other side
*  and once you've seen it you can't unsee that if if I have a song and
*  We have to and those concentric circles line up
*  It almost feels painful or criminal not to go to the other side when you know, it gets so much better there
*  and and I feel like what I've been kind of learning is I also should
*  Apply the same understanding to the people I care about, you know, like
*  If there's a way for us to have something more meaningful, that's all that
*  being meaningful is like
*  Money is green paper
*  You know, these are like it's fun to have collect things, but who cares? It's the it's the relationships you have and
*  You know when you have kids and stuff it's like having enjoying that shit even when it's rough that's
*  That's the thing to get good at. Mm-hmm. You know what I mean?
*  You'll have plenty of time to dial alone as you were, you know later. Yeah, you know, and so I feel like
*  That's what I'm kind of getting from that from what she's saying and so it's that works just fine
*  Yeah, well if it works if it works use it right it's not it's not exclusively that either, you know, it's just like
*  It's a tool. Yeah, it's one of the tools that I would use in
*  every situation is situational and so I I feel like what's great is to have a bunch of tools and not pretend to know I
*  Was one I mean I try to ask this as many musicians as possible, but how do you guys create music?
*  Do you do you write stuff out and then come to the band?
*  Do some of the guys bring their own ideas for for a beat or for a concept or well, you know, I
*  Like the randomness of it all and and again, I I love collaboration. I've never done anything just me all by myself
*  That doesn't there are times when I make you make a request of people you play with we're like I hear all of this
*  Can we just try that first?
*  Because and I like to do that when someone says that in return if they feel like
*  Sometimes you hear everything all at once and that's a that is a gift and you kind of don't want to mess with that
*  You want at least start from that point?
*  Because if someone does have an idea at least they're starting from
*  Understanding where this how this is
*  There so their idea if they have one is rooted in this instead of being kind of arbitrary, you know
*  Does that make sense? Mm-hmm. And then so
*  But it's great to hear that and also be asked to kind of be a soldier sometimes sure I'll play
*  Because I'd love to hear that all these puzzle pieces together right right right
*  But it also respect their their idea their vision whatever it is. You're just trying to help them realize it
*  Yeah, sometimes sometimes it's like that and sometimes I'm requesting that and there's a way to communicate that that sounds exciting
*  Yeah
*  You should because it's a shame to be misunderstood in that moment when really what you're saying is oh my god
*  I have this idea
*  can we try it just like this for a start and once you're emerged in this understanding your ideas to
*  Better it will be based in understanding this you guys are very unique in that you don't sound like anybody else
*  But that's the point. Yeah, it is the point that in fact in fact
*  I always looked at that like well, that's the minimum obligation right as tonight. It's to not you know
*  Not sound like other folks. Yeah the men without hats to
*  You know, it's like what's the point you already have that if they want to I love that song. It's a great song
*  Yeah, it's great because it's sort of a challenge. Yeah, you can leave your friends behind
*  Yeah, you're like what the fuck what why would it if they don't dance in no friends mine?
*  Yeah, like it's sort of like drawing a dance line in the sand, you know, it's a great song
*  It is but I but also there's there's those are the kind of two ends of the spectrum, right? Mm-hmm
*  Hearing hearing someone's honestly and do and and explaining yours honestly and asking for help to just to do that
*  Well, you're all your stuff is not just unique. It's unique in
*  Itself like your songs are different. Each song is different than the other song
*  There's like you don't there's not like a Queen's of the Stone Age sound
*  well
*  I think there's a band called weaned that I love so much and
*  Early on my first band Kaius that was trying to sound like itself itself, but singularly. Mm-hmm
*  And I was feeling painted in a corner a little bit by the fact that it had to be in this mode
*  And we toured with this band weaned because who would play anything. Do you you know who they aren't sure?
*  they're so brilliant and
*  They'd play a mr. Would you please help my pony where you're like what what the fuck is that about and then they'd play
*  Riders on the storm for 28 minutes. Wow fucking incredible. They never soundchecked it. You're like
*  You just know this
*  And and what they were was free
*  They said and then they did a country record with all these professional hired gun country
*  You know and and it sounded incredible because they were like because we can do that. Why can't we yeah that manifesting what you love?
*  period and so I just
*  From being around them and seeing things like that and then starting this desert sessions project, which is what I just put out
*  Recently where it's just collaboration and it could be anything because it's not all you you know, but yet it's you and
*  So it was that's how Queen started was like what if you just played anything you thought was good
*  No matter what it was and you let every song
*  Had a friend of mine once say to me, you know
*  Not every song can be your best and I and I just looked at him and I was like why?
*  What is that why is that I don't even know why that has to be a possibility why not
*  Yeah, what if you if you see through those spinning locks through to the other side and
*  A song could go there. You should take it there, right? I mean, that's what we're supposed to do
*  Yeah, and it's a weird pessimistic attitude. Isn't it? Like not every song can be your best and it was like
*  Oh, I see you're talking about are you talking about yours?
*  Yeah, I see. Do you remember how when before you were like, oh, I'm gonna go to the other side
*  Yeah, I see how when before the internet like there was a lot of bands that would put out like a few hits on an album
*  But then the rest the album would almost feel like filler. I
*  Again, that's another thing right? It seemed to me at one point in the
*  My hope was that okay in the spirit of trying to do something different. I call it on supply on demand
*  You know, it's out there cuz it's out there. Mm-hmm. What's not out there that would be interesting to hear
*  It tell me what what you don't think we need
*  and let's start there right for for just
*  trying to fill in the gaps and beautifully fill in the gaps of what's not represented and and
*  Thereby having this limitless ability to play whatever you thought was right in the moment as long as it was honest
*  Then you'd be fine, you know and uh and
*  So that's always been I just I feel like it would be fun to try that
*  So that's why it's so jumps around stylistically
*  But I do think people listen to whatever they think is good and they don't care about genre
*  What unless you're a teenager when that's important to you or that certainly was to me?
*  Why is genre important? That seems like if you work at a record store, it's important because you're filing these under like
*  You know nose flute in the key of yeah, I don't give a fuck about genre. I give a fuck about good
*  I mean I listen to country you have a taste thing that old
*  Yeah, something runs over it with its truck tire you go. Hey fuck. I'm good. Yeah, I love to lick that again
*  Well, I just it's you know, I like a song where you can tell the band made something that they like
*  Yeah, you know I mean well this this is another thing early on when we left the desert and my first band Caius
*  And we were so proud
*  Like we knew we sounded different
*  We thought this is cool and so you make records you love and you listen to them all the time because
*  Because it's like you're supposed to make your favorite music. I mean I was 15 years old. What else was I supposed to make?
*  I can't wait to make the music. I hate the most
*  It doesn't make sense. Right? I just want to do weddings
*  So you meet you tour with these bands you're like
*  do you guys listen to your records because we would be in the car on tour listening to our records and then play our
*  records and and they'd be like fucking hate that thing and I'd be like
*  No, I said do you listen to your own music like I couldn't understand
*  Right. What's wrong with playing your favorite thing? You always wanted to play but it's not out there. So you create it
*  That's all right. It seems like that's the job actually
*  Yeah, and how can you look how can you love my stuff if I don't right? Right? What are the fucking chances like?
*  0.0 is
*  0.0 is
*  Well, it would be such a prison
*  Imagine if you created a genre that was super popular and people really loved it, but you fucking hated it. I did
*  My first band there's this really wonderful thing happened the fans took over and they own it
*  Because we stopped and so they took it over the fans kept it alive and some people gave it a name stoner rock
*  What to me is stoner rock was like Ozzy when I was a kid like the Ozzy baseball shirts
*  Sure, I wanted to be a punk rocker and it's like don't stoners over there, you know, so stoner rock
*  I was like no no and plus I don't want to wear that I
*  Can appreciate anything that I like so we don't need to call it anything. Mm-hmm
*  Because I'll just like whatever I like right right right, you know, you could call it jazz rabbit. That's the style of music and be like
*  Fucking fantastic, but I just like what I like in that anyways. Yeah, it's just a noise you're making with your face
*  I'm it. Yeah
*  Charlie Brown's teacher. Yeah
*  Oh, I love that style. Actually, it's like exactly who care right? Like I like what I like and um and
*  You know you get it flack for that stuff for not like no sit here wear this and I understand too because it's good to feel
*  Part of something how many so I get flack for it. How much do you pay attention to criticism zero good for you?
*  I I don't I haven't read about myself in
*  Over a decade. That's amazing way to go. Well, the first time I did I
*  Remember when I got a computer and I was like, oh you mean they you can
*  Sometimes I feel like such a like a dumb nuts like I'm like, oh you can talk to someone like who's like into your tunes
*  it's like I and
*  I did and
*  you know, sometimes people like to bond over what they don't like and
*  Like and also they like to pretend it makes them feel better to pretend they have intimate knowledge of you Joe Rogan
*  Mm-hmm. Well think about Joe is you see yeah what he and it's got to be negative. So always oh because it suggests that
*  We're close enough to I know his secrets, you know, it puts on good face for you
*  but I know his fucking Joe secrets man, so think about Joe is and it's it's a
*  That's kind of an insecurity and so when I went on I was like, oh no, no, actually I'm doing this
*  And they said you're not the real the and I just let it be known
*  Yes, I fucking am and
*  And then all the sudden was like hey Josh. I thought oh my god. This is
*  What am I gonna do go door to door and correct people's perception?
*  Actually what happened in 1742 is it's a waste of my time
*  Some people who don't have like a wise
*  Sort of perspective on the internet getting wrapped up and doing just that because they then responding to criticism and going after people and
*  You know what? It's because they they don't want to be blamed. They don't want to be misunderstood
*  right, I totally understand I understand my wife has
*  been one of my biggest inspirations ever and
*  like
*  That that thing that I really learned from her is like the
*  You can't blame when you blame someone it's like saying to them
*  When you point the finger it's like saying you're guilty before you even have a chance to talk and save your perspective
*  Mm-hmm. What that's nobody likes that? You know what I mean?
*  Nobody wants to like start by being blamed for something
*  You shut off it immediately and now you have these disengaged people
*  Blaming each other and being mean to each other and again if we're talking about doing what you like
*  I don't like that and I also have friends
*  I really love that engage in that quite a bit and it's a trouble spot for them
*  And so instead of doing it myself, I I try to like look at that and say ooh
*  I don't I don't want that I I
*  Love my music and I try to make it as real as I can and I try to make it as different as I can
*  And I accept if you don't like it, but if you have a vinyl or if you have a CD still I
*  Love it. And if you don't it's still a hell of a coaster, right?
*  It's not bad. You know, I mean could be a worse coaster. The art looks cool
*  You know, I I need to be okay with that. Mm-hmm and accept that shit
*  Because otherwise what I'm please like it
*  Well, you're also looking at that review right that reviewer is wrong
*  I can't unmanageable numbers to it
*  right
*  It was you'd be interacting with literally thousands of people every day and trying to correct them and then once people find out that all
*  They have to do to get your attention is to be negative
*  Then I've had moments of that before because I really have always cared about fairness and justice
*  but especially in the last bunch of years, you know, it's like I
*  I
*  Have to be okay with what I did for me and people don't really know what the fuck
*  They're talking about and what really goes on
*  But if my expectation is that I'm gonna get take everyone to a spot where like this is what actually happened, right?
*  I'll be sad and you're also engaging people that don't want you to be a good guy
*  So they want to go fuck you you just want us to think that of course
*  Yeah, of course and then and I'm actually kind of investing time and energy into like no, but yeah, but no, right
*  I mean you're investing time and energy also into your persona or your public
*  Public perception of you. I don't have a persona. I've had many times where because of being
*  like
*  Like feeling
*  Strange about things or angry about things or this I take them out on stage
*  Sometimes because I grew up watching bands like and
*  Iggy and all the stuff where
*  Sometimes you go see a band and it's scary and it's wonderful to be scared by this music is like whoa and
*  Everything that comes with it. It's so fucking real. Look out. It can actually drive you backwards. That's
*  Exhilarating and also on stage. That's the place for that
*  Yeah out in real life doing that like why you're at the ATM not so much
*  You know what I mean, yeah, but to
*  To cut your tethers loose and go I don't know what I'm gonna do tonight
*  Which I have done many times and walked out there, but I will embody the emotion that I'm
*  Feeling right now and and you can go ahead and take that shit to the ATM and deposit that because that's what's gonna happen
*  the problem is is if you're
*  Not doing well
*  Then that's how that yeah, but you're gonna feel that when you get out there, but it is supposed to well
*  I'm willing to do anything up there
*  And I don't know why because I feel like that's the place. That's why
*  Because that's the place for it. It's that's the art of it. Well, it's also what you said that you enjoy the randomness of it
*  Yeah, I mean I think that you're talking about manifesting if you go up there with that spirit that
*  Enjoying the randomness of it then this sometimes the spirit will move you in a direction that you didn't even expect right? Well, yeah
*  Yeah, because you feel one with your actions so in the now you have no choice right and
*  Preparation all it's too late. It's it's already done. The the preparation is over. It's like a fight. Yeah that like
*  You're not gonna learn anything extra till it's over
*  You have to be in the moment there and I enjoy that because I enjoy that it's too late. I love insurmountable odds
*  That's all I need to do something is tell me like there's no way you're gonna make it and be like
*  That's sounds great
*  With the why do we have to worry if we're not gonna make it, you know, I mean there's something to that and
*  But I also realized like how
*  I
*  guess the manifestation aspect of this has gotten important to me again because it's what I did in the beginning and
*  As I you know have these moments of being lost and feeling like I don't understand what's going on and wondering why
*  When really it's because of me, you know, yeah that
*  That
*  The best thing I can do that's why the records have gotten so dark because that's all I'm seeing and it has to be real
*  So it is real dark, you know, but there's a beauty in that too
*  But I don't want to make shit my new normal
*  My dad's always like don't get accustomed to shit
*  You know cuz it's like once you get used to that you're like this this is life. This is normal, right?
*  Is everyone cool and and people end up people you love end up going no
*  It's not you know, and and you go wait a minute, but I'm so used to it. Well, I thought you were gonna
*  Hop in this jacuzzi with me the temp water is great. It's shit shit water
*  and I so I'm
*  I'm really like I'm so thankful to have like a
*  great group of a family of artists that I get to collaborate with and like
*  My some great kids. I got three of them every time I go in a room. There's another one of them in there
*  you know, there's so many fucking kids and and my wife who like
*  really
*  has the courage to
*  Help has had the courage her whole life to like go
*  that's it's time to go, you know, it's time to do this like
*  You know
*  someone that
*  Has really inspired me to have a partnership like that is fucking rad
*  Yeah, you know, I mean talking about
*  Someone that
*  Has had a really rough beginning
*  But never blamed doesn't spend pointing the finger and blaming because it shit goes nowhere
*  Some of the most interesting people in the world the ones who had a rough beginning
*  Yeah, because of the hair coping mechanisms and pinballing off off and getting to yeah, they're wonderful strength
*  Yeah, well, and that's the other thing is the strength
*  the strength to to go
*  Right now and and that that strength
*  for is so
*  Inspiring for me it's good. It gives me strength through her. You know, yeah, it's like that's beautiful
*  What one of things I always like to talk to people that are famous about because it's that this that word you're famous
*  I don't know if you know you're famous. It's a weird thing. All right being famous is a strange thing
*  No one teaches you how to handle that. No one teaches you what to do and no advice will help no advice
*  No, because your experience is so unique. Yeah. Yeah, and there's it's it's a very difficult waters
*  Yeah, do you enjoy that notoriety part of it at all?
*  Fucking weird. It's weird. I find it. I find it very difficult. It's hard to swim. Yeah, hard to stay in the lane you
*  and
*  You know, I think of the king of comedy was like mmm, you know that movie the narrow. Yeah. Yeah where it's like
*  Jerry Lewis is walking in and says my son loves you. Can I get an autograph?
*  And he says I'm in a hurry and she goes I hope you get cancer
*  Yeah, like it's it's unusual to deal with that twist. Yes. Yes, and also um
*  So much of the way I was raised to be private and things like that are looked at as like a diss now
*  Mm-hmm, or like if someone says something bad about you if you don't say something back
*  You're a pussy. Yeah. Well or that like when you don't people
*  By not you you're not
*  You don't score any points by not defending yourself to the hilt in front of everybody
*  Yeah, but I just wasn't raised that way. I was raised to be like
*  That's what I mean. Well, there's also an issue in this day and age like if you defend yourself against every single piece of criticism
*  You'll be lost you will not ever have a life you do there's like numbers again
*  When they know that you'll engage yes, you manifest them to come back more
*  I mean, this is the epitome of of what we're talking about here and and
*  Being able to recognize that just that have that understanding of
*  Where it clicks and you go I can't focus on those things right like I have a beautiful daughter and two boys
*  I have a strong
*  Lovely wife who's an incredible artist. I have this family of people
*  How about them instead?
*  And not fucking Gary who lives in Gary and you know what I mean? Yeah, it's just Gary on Gary crime out there
*  You know, yeah, yeah, it's um, it's it's a weird lesson to learn too that in this day and age
*  This world is very different than it was 20 30 years ago
*  They're the access that people have to you the didn't you just grow up riding your bike around and like be down at dinner
*  It's like be back when the Sun goes down, right? Yeah, you're like, oh you mean in forever
*  It seemed like the Sun, you know
*  Days were so long and now these kids are like I know kids that would prefer to play a basketball game then go outside and play a basketball game
*  Mm-hmm, and I was think I was think I
*  Think you fucked up. I think it's supposed to be the other way around the video game is supposed to be not as interesting
*  And then you look at like the commercial like we're bringing people together
*  Synergy, you know and like all the shit where you like fuck you
*  Wow
*  They're trying to sell bringing people together, but yeah, exactly. I think it's the entire world like one net
*  I have three kids as well and it's insanely hard. I think to be a child today
*  I think to be a young adult today, too
*  I mean the pressures that people have is a book Jonathan Haight wrote called the coddling of the American mind that
*  Discusses the issue that kids are having today with
*  Cellphones and depression and because of social media use and that especially girls so many girls are cutting themselves and self-harm suicide
*  Way up dude, and there's a direct correlation between the invention of the smartphone and social media
*  And all these things take such a dick move to call a smartphone, too
*  Because it's it's presupposing if you disagree
*  I'm sorry. Tell me why you don't like a smartphone, right? That's true
*  Yeah, well, I know a lot of smart people that have switched notice you have this shit in here is it oh yeah
*  Yeah, because
*  No worries, man. We got a little filtration system. We can kick in a little I went to school with filtration. Nice guy
*  Have you tried to at all to kick those things I did but
*  Every time I have like some cut type terrible event I
*  Got I guess I got my excuse back, right? Yeah, it gives you something. Come on. I'm always your friend
*  Well, it's yeah, come get a hug. I'm the only thing that will hurt you later
*  Later who's this later? Is that even real man taking two minutes off your life? Those are the end ones those ones suck
*  Well, and also it blows my mind that someone goes to work at Philip Morrison has a good parking spot and like it's the burs are
*  Singing they're like, oh, hey Sheila. Hey Gary
*  And they go in they're like want to talk to you about this high school campaign in Burma
*  For cities like yeah, are you fucking it's sort of it's sort of akin to like
*  Like one day I had this thought which many people have had before me and many after but realizing it myself that
*  There's these brilliant minds that make these machines
*  and craft the whole thing
*  And put a button that and moron can touch. Yeah
*  Boom
*  Who's the moron now, right you you made all that shit and then you made it easy for
*  This mouth breather to touch button. It should have been complex calculus involved in pressing the button
*  Certainly the Macarena would have to be like face activated to do it like so that you kind of look like a dick
*  Right if you want sure if you want to blow this thing up, you got a kind of
*  Embarrass yourself
*  That's a great idea actually, you know, it's actually a very good idea
*  Well a friend of mine sold a really killer house recently. She's a real estate agent
*  She sold this really killer killer house to this guy who's in the tobacco industry and we were talking about I was like wow
*  guys fucking
*  Murdering people. I mean, it's just like see you kids later buying a badass house and slowly taking away people's health
*  But I'm in favor of people being able to do it. I mean in both sides sell it and buy it
*  that's what's so strange is is that I
*  somehow there's something inside me that
*  hates rules so much because
*  Before we wrote rules down there was the sort of organic rules of like, you know
*  Living with people once there's more than a few huts people are like, alright, no yelling after two in the morning
*  Do we all want that and no no one fucks Gary? He's eight, right? You know what?
*  I mean don't fuck Gary. Yeah, and and then as more people come those rules organically change and the old ones fade away
*  But for me today, it's like don't walk on the grass. It's like really the best part of this area
*  What do you think grass is for Gary you?
*  Don't walk in the grass is one of the dumbest things you could say or
*  Yeah, it's like talking about man. Like I don't get it. Yeah. Also you don't care, you know
*  So many times you see somebody and they're they're guarding a doorway
*  No one will ever go in or out of anyways, and they're just sitting there and and that's what I'm like
*  Do you want a water? Do you want like a do you want a dr. Pepper? That shit is great
*  Do you what do you want? Because I think
*  You don't care about this door. I don't either
*  You know, what's the who somebody does and it's worth $10 an hour, right? Someone does that's never there
*  That's why they care about it because they don't know shit about that door sometimes
*  You know and so I I have poor things that make no sense like that
*  I tell you I'll tell you an example of many times, you know, you record late into the night and
*  You come to at 3 in the morning you in the streets of the valley you come to a stoplight and there's nobody coming in any
*  Direction and then you're looking at the light red. There's no one I
*  just go after I know it's safe because
*  The function for this thing is now gone, right?
*  What am I supposed to listen? I'm born to listen to the color reds come out
*  But then there might be like some fucking cop hiding and there has been I've been pulled over for four times really
*  Yeah, what do you say? Well, I said the same thing. We're just two guys in the middle of the night who want to go home
*  It was safe to go. I shouldn't have went and I won't do it again
*  The cop let you go every time and plus he had to go through it to catch to even catch up to me, right?
*  You know what? I mean, what are we doing here? You know, you don't care. I don't care
*  I just was trying to go I just want to go home, right and
*  And I won't I'm sorry
*  You're a line stepper Josh
*  Smoking cigarettes, you're a rebel you're gold tooth and your fucking tattoos and your knuckles your goddamn line stepper. You should talk
*  Takes one to no one sir, I understand but but but also also understand that
*  We can coexist and be really wonderful to each other and omit something that we both agrees if we both say it's
*  Stupid. Yeah, and we still do it
*  What what are we doing? The line is better, right?
*  Exactly aren't you sort of in a minimum style obliged to even consider stepping out? Yeah
*  We need less rules
*  What if it wasn't a line at all and it just like a piece of wood was laying there and then someone picked it up
*  And someone was like is that a line?
*  What if you're accidentally in a line that has no business being formed, you know, it's like I don't I
*  Think you owe it to yourself to at least take the minute and check that out
*  if they came out with
*  cancerless cigarettes
*  That were real similar. They were just like right next to a select almost indistinct like that meatless burger
*  I haven't had one of those you have one of those Jamie. Holy shit, man. Have you had one tacos?
*  Yeah
*  No, how is it it's it's probable it's so good really oh my fucking god, it's so good
*  So it tastes like a burger who cares it tastes real good
*  You know, whatever it is. It's good
*  Like I like I always thought the dumbest thing is fake bacon cuz you're like there's no you have no chance
*  And you should just call it like yeah
*  Lakin or like or Lincoln or something else like away from bacon like it can just be its own thing, right?
*  You don't have to be like it's fake bacon bacon area, but we're close bacon. It's like heard that no, you're not I
*  You know, they haven't figured that out yet, but they have figured never gonna burrs. Yes. Yeah that impossible sausage
*  I just hork that down like it's the yeah. Yeah, I've what about a
*  I never even bite it. I just I
*  Can they have an impossible cigarette if they did though?
*  My thought was people would still like if they were really stressed out
*  They would want the real thing because part of what they want is that fuck you
*  I'm just gonna fucking smoke a cigarette, you know, that's well, it's kind of like the chop
*  It's like chocolate in its own way. It's like a gross or chocolate
*  I suppose it's but it's that the thing you're doing, you know is bad, but you're doing it and part of you're doing
*  It's like there's an acceptance. Well, I blame Matt Dillon for my case
*  Yeah over the edge, you know the outsiders
*  I
*  Rumble fish stay gold pony boy. It's like like young toughs. Yeah, you know, I like
*  Whatever happened to that guy Matt Dillon. He still lives all kinds of shit. I haven't seen him in anything
*  You're not looking I'm not there. He is look at him looks like fucking cool, dude
*  You don't want to fucking do that shit when you're like, I was I was like a 12 years old 11 years old
*  I'm 11 and I'm like what's cool that well that shit is pretty cool
*  Fucking cool. Yeah, look at them
*  cigarette motorcycle jacket big smile beautiful face
*  Oh, I thought you're talking about Matt Dillon or me a bothy. No, but him on the screen you right here
*  I'm just yeah, I mean it's um, no cigarettes are a weird one though, right?
*  It's cuz they're but they should be I think they should be available a hundred percent
*  But just like I think whiskey should be available just like I think it's pot should I mean I put a post on Instagram today
*  Joe Biden once he thinks that pots a gateway drug and he wants to keep it illegal spoken like someone that doesn't
*  Ever smoke pot. Yeah, and also, you know what? It's a gateway to asked. It's a gateway to like Doritos dust on your chest
*  Yeah
*  Well, there's people that say it's a gateway for them. But I guess if you were the person who does meth
*  Because you smoke pot you were probably gonna do meth. Anyway, you probably needed meth in your life. Well, I certainly think that
*  That at the end of the day
*  If they took that money and then put it into less fearful things that work like talking about what drugs do and
*  Like what you might be masking by taking them. Yes having an honest dialogue
*  Yeah, everything seems like a dishonest dialogue. Like we're gonna go to it. We're gonna have a war on terror
*  We're gonna have a war on drugs. We're gonna have a war on this. Yeah, it's like, huh
*  Can we start with a talk about it first? No, I have to go right to war. You ever listen to Gabor Mate?
*  That's how you say his name he's a doctor who speaks about
*  Drugs and addiction and his take on it is that all addiction almost all of it
*  They are the origin of his trauma for sure. Yeah childhood trauma abuse things that have happened to you that were terrible
*  Yeah, and that led to you trying to let them saying blocking making a dam
*  Yeah
*  Because you think that'll stop whatever the river of pain that you should just be walking along as it's a trickle
*  You're walking through and this is the current state of the art when you know or the state of the science of in the studies in terms
*  in terms of like
*  Psychologists and people that do counseling they understand human beings that have addiction problems
*  So that's one of the more offensive things about someone like Joe Biden running for president saying that it's like no
*  You're even done the work. That's a photo op moment
*  Like yeah, and in fact because I've had so much experience with various things
*  I got more knowledge about it than he does of course because I've been through it
*  Yeah, and and I understand why I would do those things and I understand how
*  Essentially, it's just it's a band-aid over an amputee wound
*  Yeah, and what's really more important is to like be vulnerable enough to engage somebody, you know that word vulnerable
*  I was reading this book. It's called daring greatly by
*  Brunet Brahma or something like it's really wonderful and
*  It even went in the etymology of
*  Vulnerable the word vulnerable which is a place that's lacking armor and
*  identifying that
*  Is a strength because you know where the that spot is and that weakness is is identifying that spot and doing nothing
*  So they're almost this this each a lens of the same situation, but just going in opposite directions
*  Vulnerability is the opposite of weakness and and uh
*  And I think you have to take a chance on people and you have to take a chance on yourself and not just be like
*  They're bad as
*  If they themselves it's sort of like I blame the devil for the things I do wasn't me
*  It was that it's the depth, you know, right?
*  How can how can you stand over a mushroom on the ground and be like you're illegal?
*  What's that?
*  If you say you say you saw me do that alone and point at a mushroom and you were like 40 feet away
*  Like you would go the fuck it's going on over there. You're illegal
*  Yeah, I want these picked and taken to my house immediately. Well, what's crazy is Paul Stamets who's was on my podcast last week
*  He's a mycologist
*  He's a mushroom specialist and one of the things that he talked about was this one particular area in the Pacific Northwest
*  Where psilocybin mushrooms grow and cops literally wait there?
*  People go to pick them and then they what a service dumb game pat them down and take the mushrooms from them and arrest them
*  What a dumb game plucked something out of the ground think look at our numbers
*  Yeah, like what a weird service so fucking stupid go for mushrooms will take you to jail for free
*  It's like hilarious is calling yourself an officer of the peace and doing that piece of what piece of the action?
*  Yeah
*  There's so much peace growing out of the ground there
*  Well, you're you're actually arresting people for seeking peace
*  I I find that I don't want to ever get swept away and in order to make my point
*  I have to run something up the flagpole of extreme because every my the modern word
*  I actually like a spectrum because it feels like a gas tank of a gas need like there's a blend here
*  right that we're looking for and so on this on the subject of
*  Drugs and things like that
*  Everything gets run up the flagpole of extreme and put into the same category everything goes to full. Yeah. Yeah
*  You know what bad is it's all of this is bad, right?
*  Right and even down to like be good girls and boys where you're like, what the fuck does that mean?
*  Do whatever you say that's bizarre. Yeah, that's not good. Well, you know what you're doing
*  You're older than me your parents fucked before mine did that's okay
*  That's a great that's a great methodology for listening to somebody
*  Yeah, you know, I'm older that's like and
*  Supposed to no more. Well, we're also imprisoned by our language to a certain extent, especially with the word drug
*  You know because I the whole time we've been talking I'm on a drug. I'm drinking this coffee
*  Right. So this is caffeine and you know, you've got your drug there. You're smoking cigarettes. That's nicotine. No, I don't
*  It's not even a drug man. Let it go
*  Yeah, but I mean the the the concept of drugs like if someone sees you at the Starbucks cop they don't say oh my god
*  Look at that drug user, but that's clearly a drug
*  I mean caffeine affects you there's a reason why they sell venti because people didn't get jacked up enough on a tall
*  Yeah, remember that shit. Oh, yeah, it's still here. Do you remember red line? Remember that stuff?
*  No, that's red line was a thing that people would to it was like a workout drink and but people were dropping dead of it
*  It's like it's so it and it was a great name though. It was a red line. Yeah
*  Well, you were fucking readily get the flat line it hit that 8,000 rpm
*  But it's it's I think is more than one serving one of those little fucking cans too and nobody reads that shit
*  Oh, it's not four servings per can you like what am I taking a sip and passing around to my friends?
*  I love the fuck out of here. I love that that would be a necessity for a good workout though. Oh, well, it'll help
*  Yeah, yeah, there was some shit that used to be able to buy that
*  I don't think you could buy anymore called ripped fuel
*  Remember one time I took it and went to jujitsu class. I almost had a fucking heart attack
*  I had to pull over to the side. I had to sit on the side of the mat
*  I'm like, dude, my heart is pounded on my fucking chest right now. I you know
*  It's funny because
*  Those types of
*  Supplements, you know people keep getting caught with tainted things and you go how really is it? Who's making these?
*  Yeah, you know, does that mean there's also like yak hair in there too on accident or what?
*  Well, what it is is a lot of is coming out of places like China where we had an issue with that with my company
*  On it where we were selling we sell this thing called alpha brain, which is a cognitive enhancing neutropic
*  it's a bunch of vitamins and nutrients that enhance the way your memory functions and
*  We got it tested by a third party
*  He found a bunch of stuff that was in there is not supposed to be in there
*  Because and this is like like just random lunch next no extra vitamins and shit
*  But what it is is these companies that create these vats you say if you have a supplement company so they're all the same bowl
*  Yeah, it's exactly they don't clean the bowl. Yeah, that's really what it is
*  So that's where a lot of these
*  Athletes get caught with like trace amounts of steroids and it's just from a tainted supplement
*  You really got to clean your bowls gotta clean those balls. I mean, I don't know how it works
*  I don't know how they clean them but but it happened barely
*  Yeah in some countries in some companies some shitty companies that sell a lot of you know
*  They'll have steroids in it or Viagra in it or a bunch of other stuff. Yeah, you buy in vitamins
*  You get how are they cleaning that? I was like they just have paid two guys to just blow into the thing
*  Yeah, I don't know when it's empty. It's empty
*  Sometimes maybe they don't clean it at all
*  They just dump it out dump out what's in there and then pour the next thing and they don't give a fuck
*  Well, I think you know
*  Really this whole conversation is very connected it's about the intention and engaging and
*  Realizing there are no corners to cut that there are you know
*  Every mountain has a valley next to it. That's the way it was formed
*  That's the way it is your deficiency wherever that is is it almost like a flag your talent is right next to it and
*  Perhaps that's a really good way to put it for kids
*  For a kid that can't pay attention in school, I want to be one I want to be a wonderfully engaged father I
*  It's something I love and it's something that as they
*  Traverse the ages and you have to keep adapting the stuff that worked when they were five don't work no more
*  Right when they're seven or six. Yeah, when you've only had you know, you know
*  like 50 months
*  50 months two or three months is a lot that's a big chunk of those months. Yeah, and I I I
*  Think what I love about my wife too, and it's that we're both like, how do we do this? Hmm engaged in that like
*  That
*  You're learning as they're learning
*  And that that that's can be fun, too, right?
*  Because you know how many times you catch yourself saying like getting upset about the perspective of a three-year-old right we're like
*  But I'm not three. Oh, I see why you're upset. I cuz you're three and so you think the closet actually has a
*  Monster that oh, that's cool because I can get my head around that. Yeah, let's talk to it
*  Yeah, it's interesting talking to a three-year-old like my kids aren't three anymore
*  But the youngest ones are nine and eleven and I remember when they were three you'd have these really weird conversations like
*  Monsters are real right and I'm like, well monsters aren't real in terms of like the monsters you think but there's things
*  That are just as scary as monsters that are like a crocodile
*  Crocodiles a real thing then we would go to the internet and show them crocodiles like killing a zebra and it was probably not a smart thing
*  For a fucking adult to show a three-year-old, but I'm
*  Well, you can't please you kids feels like you can't teach the abstract to someone that's not like if you were I love the
*  Apprentice the guild system so much not to show the apprentice
*  I love the actual get like Cooper's barrels and stuff
*  Those are things where you start by sweeping the floor
*  Mm-hmm, and you start by grabbing those rings over here
*  All you're equipped to do is touch them right now, right?
*  Right, right and slowly work your way up to be able to put the way to barrel together
*  I'm sick of touching them and then you think to yourself
*  Cool only three more weeks of that and you should be so ready to do something else that you'll pay attention to what I have to say
*  Yeah, you start with nothing and you get a little bit until you declare
*  I'm sick of handling this because I fucking got it, you know, and then you go
*  Okay. Well if you're that if you're that big for your britches, why don't I add one more thing?
*  That's one of the dangers of our instant access on demand Google this instant answers
*  Being able to stream this press it anytime you want this society is that people don't understand the value of
*  Wanting something pursuing it and having a long road to accomplishing it the gift of nothing. Yeah
*  like where I'm feel really blessed to be from death because
*  There wasn't a thing to do and when you tried to do something the police the local police because they had nothing to do
*  we're like
*  Probably gonna drive over a skateboard
*  You'd be like why do that? Why what the fuck?
*  Yeah, so you you you plunge yourself into more esoteric locations and hobbies
*  Because of sheer fucking boredom. Mmm, and like boredom is good fucking amazing. It's really good
*  I mean, it's so it's so important and no one's bored in five minutes. Yeah. No, but like
*  That's why I do. That's why I don't play basketball because I'm playing a basketball game. It's already going on
*  It's like shootings hard I get all sweaty
*  Well, it's it's also it's like you're doing something with your body and your mind
*  Whereas you're sitting there just with a video game just moving your thumbs around engaging with something. You're not going anywhere
*  You're not getting out. Well, there's something about the way those waves are which says you're in high anxiety
*  You're in conflict. You're in this you're you're you're doing it all the thing your brain is alive
*  Your brain is doing everything that
*  That is associated with moving and getting in there and competition and your body
*  It's got Doritos dust on your chest and inside your belly button. Yeah, so it's the the absence of connection between body and mind
*  Which which when you're at your best when you're at your best isn't your body and mind one?
*  Like a picture of this man who's climbing this this this giant majiggy that wall. Yeah, like
*  This is the this is the moment to be engaged and
*  Both body and mind because that feels good. Yeah, you know
*  I reckon you just get depressed doing that playing that all the time some some people do so and some people love it
*  But they do become drone pilots. Yeah, that's true, too
*  And and and and one day it dawns on them. What has occurred?
*  Well, they say that that's a severe source of PTSD that a lot of those drone pilots
*  Even though they're not physically there a lot of them have pretty severe PTSD because one day that damn breaks
*  Mm-hmm and and and you feel yourself drowning and they understand the connection between their actions and and what?
*  And the PTSD is that you are forced to go downstream and realize like
*  But the old way of me must be gone. It must it must I must let that drown
*  you know, otherwise you're stuck in their loop of of
*  That realization that you that you wasted time building a dam as if that were the coolest thing ever
*  yeah, instead of walking along the river and going downstream and
*  Dealing with the trickle as as it should be, you know, hey, let me ask you this about cigarettes. Have you ever tried vaping? I
*  tried for a sec, but
*  It looks stupid
*  It looks stupid
*  Alright, you know like do me a favor would you bring up that picture of Jimi Hendrix when he's vaping
*  It doesn't exist. Thank God you can't
*  Could you imagine Jimi Hendrix one of those lunchbox ones those big old fat ones with a robot dick in the end of it?
*  Yeah, not Jimmy. No
*  Jimmy where it looks like a pump for like, you know like for pumping water out of a pool
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, what is that? Why are they getting those big ones? What is the what's the benefit of those giant batteries?
*  I think it's just going all in and saying that like I'm doing this so I'm doing the whole thing
*  I'm do it the most you know, it's right. It's like what I see those those motorcycle cars
*  which are two wheels up front and one in the back, right and I think like
*  It's a bit like the segue and taking it to the lamest thing you could all the way
*  There's almost something the segue is those things handle better than a motorcycle. I can't handle them
*  No, well certainly they're more stable because the two wheels are up front but right I'm not riding a motorcycle for stability
*  You're not but some people are right some people the guys who ride those Hayabusa's and shit like that
*  Well to each his own I don't ever want to stand in the way of my own joy
*  Let alone someone else's but you like cruisers, right? I do you got out there? Is that a Harley?
*  That's that's my grandpa bike so I take my gal the movies or dinner or something and just enjoy
*  her arms around my waist, you know what I mean and to go slow and and listen to NPR on 20 or
*  Listen to you ever just drive with no music. Of course. Yeah, of course. I have a Corvette
*  1965 Corvette. No, it's got no radio in it. It's one of things I love about it
*  Yeah, when I drive that thing I just drive
*  That's why I like to drive back home to the desk because
*  You know me just being me
*  And experiencing what's going on? Yeah, it's fine. Yeah sensations
*  It's like it's to me. It's it's almost like a form of meditation as well because you have to pay attention
*  Like you're saying I mean mine doesn't have a roof. It's a convertible. So I'm feeling the air
*  I see the stars and you have to look at everything around you and those cars you really feel the road
*  Oh, yeah, so if you run over a pea like you definitely get princess out and are like, hey
*  67 Camaro I've had since I was great. It was my it's my first car. Oh, that's amazing. You have your first car
*  Yeah, fuck. Yeah god damn and and there's been times when I
*  Haven't done well or something. I've had to sleep in it and all these things so we have this
*  Long relationship and it never breaks down. It's always just wonderful to we're wonderful to each other and
*  And you feel the road when you hit something you're like, hey, right and so you're attached to it
*  And I I love riding in a caddy or something like that too where it's like you could run over
*  Multiple bodies and feel nothing right? But but but I enjoy the drive one
*  When I'm on the road sitting on a seat with five wheels one of my hand and four on the road
*  It's a great experience my old man for a brief second has 65
*  Corvette stingray
*  Derek amazing cars. They just the way that thing looks like they just nailed it. It's very organic. Yeah, they nailed it
*  It's definitely taken off of a stingray. Like someone was like, oh, well, it's I don't know
*  I mean, it doesn't really look like a stingray to me, but what it looks like it's just that front
*  Yeah, there's that bit of that shaping that inspiration of the shape but to me, I guess and I think I I'm so
*  Always a lost one
*  It's like if you could make something and you're gonna ask everyone to help you and we're gonna grab all this shit from wherever
*  We're gonna grab it from can can we make it look cool or no?
*  Like what is your version to every not everything has to look like an egg or a drop of water, right?
*  And if it does can we do that like as cool-looking as possible
*  It should look great
*  Because that don't you feel good in that car? Oh, yeah. Yeah, it looks great. Yeah, it looked and it's it's also to me
*  It's like you're rolling around in a piece of history. So yeah
*  1965, you know, it's like that that thing was created in you know
*  The early 60s someone figured it out and put it together and then
*  Made a production line and did the most important thing ever. They said this is where we stop. Yeah, we're good
*  Yeah, and they were like this is what it looks like when it's finished. Mm-hmm a completed thought
*  Yeah, and and other people like fucking good idea, man. And and I just I
*  Have a 67 you have 65 like
*  That doesn't mean there aren't things made today. It just means like I'm down with that idea
*  It's also it captures a very specific time in American history where they made these cars that were worthwhile
*  Because when you go to 77 nobody gives a fuck about a 77 anything, you know
*  You know what I mean? Like who's buying a 77 Mustang get the fucking thing away from me, you know
*  They all look like there's a lot of people selling them
*  Well, I also think to this this guy pulled up on me and a Prius that was quite new
*  He rolled down the window and just looked at me and waved his hand over his nose like and he goes stinky
*  No way. Really? Yeah on Fairfax kind of by the Whole Foods there at Santa Monica and uh
*  And I just thought this is my first car. I haven't got another one. So you've probably gotten multiple new cars
*  That's the only car you've had. I had a Bronco and we have a family car your whole life. That's it
*  I had a Magnum for a sec, but I never sold this car. Wow
*  I can't believe you never so that is so cool. You never sold your first car and it was a 67 Camaro
*  like I've had a lot of experiences in there that were that were
*  Wonderful and some that were challenging and they're all it's it's incredible to have locked into that car
*  Yeah, I mean, but it's the shape too. That's like one of the great all-time
*  Iconic shapes in automotive history that first one was like an attempt to be like Mustang's Mustang
*  Yeah, and and they really hit it out of the park
*  Because he's 768 and 69 you can almost say that mustang going like well
*  Yeah, um, you know because that it's it's it's beautiful
*  yeah, and but I was thinking this guy like I see what he was trying to say, but uh
*  He's probably can he's probably bought a shit ton of cars, which is way worse for the footprint
*  Just off the plus batteries are made on three condoms. What does he think he's gonna do fix you by going stinky?
*  He's just being a twat. He's trying to build himself up again by breaking me down
*  But yeah, I like my grandpa said he didn't swear very much but he one of the things he was like
*  I'd have to give a shit for it to matter
*  and I
*  Just kind of chuckled
*  Because I was like thank God I'm riding in the car with him, you know, yeah because
*  Certainly, he's going up to the next like Monte Carlo and it's like stinky. Yeah, he's just gonna do it. He's not like a stinky parade
*  He's driving around a car that gets 50 miles to the gallon just mocking everything with a v8
*  Yeah, but also like on a on a stinky parade and and that's that's a that's a something
*  I don't want to float on it's a lot of negativity pumping out there
*  Yeah, but it's just weird to roll down your window and do that to people
*  Well, certainly that's too much free time in my book, you know
*  What's too much self-righteousness?
*  Yeah
*  Stinky stinky there it is. Look at that one done up. Whoo. Look at that bad boy
*  Oh, well, god damn if I could turn on my do you mind if I turn this on?
*  I'll show you a picture is that yours that my looks says it's yours. Is it not yours?
*  I don't think that says isn't yours black or is your silver? Yeah silver. Is it like that?
*  It looks a lot like that except I don't have those actually I used to have I
*  That's real close but that's not it
*  Fuck you internet
*  It's strikingly close for example, this has no door handles and no mirrors and yours does it also has a hood scoop from
*  what seems to be a Corvette actually which mine does not have and
*  those rims are much like the ones I had on my Magnum, but
*  Not what I have on my I think that's the hood from
*  69 4 to 7 I think the SS and the that's it right there it is. That's beautiful, man
*  Yeah, and I'll show you what it looks like right now because I ended up dropping a crate engine because in there which is a
*  GM which one it's a dyno blueprinted 350 Wow with aluminum heads
*  so it weighs like 800 pounds left and
*  It sounds like you're stepping on glass like in an endless mazel tov parade. Yeah, cuz like
*  Yeah, like, you know like a glass in a hankie. Yeah, well, they're like ma like glass pack mufflers. Well, I
*  In truth, I tried to calm that down because as you crest a hundred miles an hour it with the mufflers too loud
*  It's like what it's a bit like being in a b52 bomber for no reason
*  like
*  You know, yeah
*  And uh, let's see my rides. I'll show it if you if you don't mind now
*  Because uh
*  It's pretty it's lovely
*  When did you put this the crate engine into it about five years ago?
*  And what a great idea that was. Oh, yeah change the balance of the car, right? Oh, yeah
*  And it's got a new front and rear clip under it. Oh, so it's on rails
*  Like you know, you couldn't roll that thing if you if you like lubed up the freeway
*  like
*  Here it is
*  And I got these hopster yeah hopster rims on it
*  God that looks good, you know, you know what's amazing about it is um, I
*  Get in that car and I take the kids to school or something and it's that it's contagious
*  Because what happens is you feel really good as you know, you get in your
*  65 and you feel really good and you pull up with a smile on your face and go hey
*  It's a daily driver this thing yeah, it's my daily driver and
*  So that's a perfect rock star daily driver by the way. Well, it's 67 Camaro
*  It's it's the what it is is something that makes me feel really good. That is not part of a crisis
*  Yeah, you're not midlife. Yeah, not pre-life not post life. It's just it's just mine and
*  And I feel like myself in there the kids get in there
*  Five-point seat belt so you don't need a car seat because I have a seat belt
*  That's that makes a car seat look like you're doing okay, right?
*  It's it's a harness with springs that like slip. Anyway, so they can be in the car as as it is and
*  take them to school and and
*  Kid kids go like whoa and they get to get out in that. Yeah, that's how they start their day, right?
*  Right, right and and it's a little adventure. That shit is tight
*  Yeah, like even being in traffic like people are really nice to you too. They they pull up and they go
*  Yeah, most of them. Yeah. Well, I'm go stinky but
*  You know behind behind the ass of something cool is stinky. Yeah, that's true
*  Yeah, it's like check out my asses I as I trade engine and it's got to do much better in terms of emissions
*  Who?
*  You know the fact of the matter is is that as that the responsibility
*  Should be on these plastic companies and these oil companies that have negated their responsibility to like
*  You shouldn't be allowed to just like shit into the air or the environment at a record pace
*  Just so you can make dough at the expense of everybody
*  Well, they had a different thing that is just did recently where they did a satellite image of all the methane in Los Angeles
*  And they were thinking well, we're gonna we're gonna find out where all these toxic greenhouse gases are coming from and an
*  Exorbitant number of them were coming from landfills. You know, just like steaming piles of steaming piles
*  Oh shit is releasing terrible terrible gas into into the air. I can't I can't help
*  I can't help but think that you couldn't take that mulch it and turn it into something that would power something
*  Well, I think they're eventually going to be able to figure that out, you know, you're talking about the garbage patch
*  There's a guy named boy on slot. I love him. Yeah, he's coming back. He just emailed the Dutchman the young guy
*  He's got a new one that he just installed in rivers
*  so he's cleaning up these rivers and these third world countries that are, you know, extremely polluted and
*  they they're figuring out technologies to extract all these pollutants and then you could actually
*  Make a commodity out of the stuff that they pull so like the plastic that he's gonna pull from the ocean is gonna be valuable
*  It's gonna be worse. Yeah could be re yeah
*  I think it would be a wonderful thing if we could agree that there's probably enough plastic already and to keep remaking more new
*  Probably is unnecessary. Well, what's really unnecessary is using
*  Fossil fuel plastic because there is biodegradable plastic they can make from hemp. This has been well
*  The wonder drug for so long, yeah, I mean the Constitution's written on hemp paper and and and you tell someone out there like well
*  Well, I think is the Declaration of Independence
*  But yeah, I mean in also the Declaration of Coda
*  Yeah and codependent one of the drafts of the Declaration of Independence is written on hemp
*  But also like the sails of the fuckers all the ships every every ship that crossed the ocean
*  Every great work of art is written on canvas that was made with hemp the soap the clothes that
*  Doesn't fuck with the soil and no, but I once saw you standing over that plant screaming illegal
*  Illegal. Hey, dude, I gotta wrap this up man, but it's been a pleasure to talk to you
*  I've been a big fan for a long time
*  So I'm a big fan of yours as well and I loved your last special between cats and dogs
*  It it was so true. It's hard for me to watch
*  Well, thank you. Thank you and your this desert sessions is it available?
*  It's available. It's fine. It's fine. What is it called? It's it's desert sessions 11 and 12
*  It's a series of music, but if you want to check it out if you don't go check it out you fucks
*  Thank you brother. Appreciate it. Thank you. Bye everybody
