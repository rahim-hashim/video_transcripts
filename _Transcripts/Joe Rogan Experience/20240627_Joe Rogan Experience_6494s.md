# Joe Rogan Experience #1982 - John Hennessey
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6.0s)]
*  We're up. Mr. Hennessey. Mr. Rogan. Fun hanging with you today. It's been a blast. That fucking [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=10.0s)]
*  vehicle that you have built is the most ridiculous thing I've ever been inside of my life. I [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  can't believe how fast it is. We only did a speed limit today, right? Yes, but we got [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=22.92s)]
*  there very quickly. We got there very quickly, yes. 1817 horsepower and 3,000 pounds, so [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=29.04s)]
*  you got some power to weight ratio to work with there. That's like 700 more horsepower [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=35.48s)]
*  than a Tesla Plaid. Yeah, it's like taking a McLaren 765LT and adding 1,000 horsepower [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=39.76s)]
*  to it. Something nobody needs, but we've sold 36 of those, the Venom F5. What happened [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=44.92s)]
*  to you in your life that you needed to make these preposterous cars? Well, you know. What [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=52.08s)]
*  is going on? Yeah, there it is. That's the Venom F5. How did you get to be this guy? How [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=58.4s)]
*  did this start out where you're making these 1800 horsepower cars? It's probably kind of [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=64.12s)]
*  like the pool hall deal when we were younger. I didn't have a good relationship with my [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=68.56s)]
*  old man. He was a car guy, but we didn't get along. And I don't know, maybe 60 years later, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=73.16s)]
*  I'm 60 now, I still feel like I got a little chip on my shoulder or something to prove. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=78.68s)]
*  I'm getting a little bit less now, but for sure. Isn't it interesting that you would [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=83.64s)]
*  never want that for your son? No. But boy, is that a great motivating factor for success. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=88.08s)]
*  Oh, for sure. Yeah, I grew up in kind of an abusive situation and neglect, and now all [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=93.44s)]
*  of a sudden I've got all this motivation, or I've had all this motivation for the last [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=99.36s)]
*  40 years of my business career, so it's been good. It's funny, because you would never [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=102.28s)]
*  want that for your children. It's amazing how well it's worked out for people like you [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=107.64s)]
*  or for me. Yeah, I mean, I don't think everybody out there that has some level of success has [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=112.2s)]
*  not necessarily been abused and motivated by negativity, but I can definitely see with [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=118.04s)]
*  our five kids with the nurture mainly from my wife, Hope, they're going to turn out just [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  fine and they'll be plenty successful. But that's just, I don't know your story, but [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=129.12s)]
*  that's my road, how I got here. I think it can lead you to be very ambitious and very [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=134.36s)]
*  successful, but it can also just fuck your life up. Oh, sure. And you can be very ambitious [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=138.8s)]
*  and very successful and also be happy. Absolutely. That's possible too. You don't have to have [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  a tortured childhood. For sure. No, I'm very, very blessed. I mean, to have an opportunity [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=149.44s)]
*  to build toys for people, whether it's a 7,000, 800,000 horsepower pickup truck or a Venom [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  F5, we were talking earlier about first world problems, right? Yeah. Something nobody really [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=160.20000000000002s)]
*  needs. Nobody needs to go to a comedy show or MMA, but they do it for entertainment. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=165.6s)]
*  I tell people all the time, we're more, are those stars up there? Yeah, they fly. Am I [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  in the Rolls Royce? After the Ric Flair gummy bear, they're going to really start flying. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=173.04s)]
*  Yeah. So now I feel very blessed and we're definitely, you know, people come to us because [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=178.76s)]
*  they wouldn't entertain themselves with their vehicles. That's a great way of looking at [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=183.44s)]
*  it too, because that's really what those kinds of cars are. Like when I try to describe my [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=186.28s)]
*  love of old muscle cars for people, because, you know, they kind of are not super reliable. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=191.72s)]
*  They're not so great at handling. Sure. And, you know, so I turn them, I get them done [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=196.08s)]
*  into resto mods, but still they're, but when I drive them, the experience is entertaining. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=200.6s)]
*  It's like a ride. Like I'm not just in a Corolla. I'm not just in some quiet Subaru. I'm going [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=207.68s)]
*  to ride. But does it take, like when you drive your Land Cruiser, you drive, you know, one [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=213.36s)]
*  of your older cars, does it take you back to that time either when you had that car, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=217.8s)]
*  you aspired to have that car, you knew the guy or the girl that had that car kind of [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=222.32000000000002s)]
*  growing up and you wanted it back then, but you didn't know how you're going to get it? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=226.04000000000002s)]
*  Oh yeah, for sure. With my Chevelle definitely. Cause my Chevelle, I have a 1970s black with [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=229.0s)]
*  the white stripes, the Duxedo Chevelle. Sure. And when I was a kid. What's that? You got [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=235.52s)]
*  the cowl induction hood? Yeah. Well, it actually is a 454 under the hood and a Calvin, Casey [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=239.8s)]
*  Calvin, Calvin, you know, Casey, he's the man. Big Viper guy. Yeah. I fucking love that [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=246.12s)]
*  dude. Yeah. He hooked up the cowl so that it, when the ignition goes to life. Yeah. Those [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=250.0s)]
*  vacuum hoses get old and crack. And yeah. It's, when I was a kid, when I was about 16 [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  years old, one of my friends picked me up. His friend had a 1970 Chevelle and we were [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=259.92s)]
*  going somewhere. And I just remember getting in the backseat of the car going, how is it [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=264.72s)]
*  possible that this kid owns this car? This is crazy. It was the best looking car I'd [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=269.24s)]
*  ever seen in my life. On those 70 series tires, the guys used to back in the day when I had [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  a 69 olds 442 convertible. And if you didn't have the Posi rear end, you'd had the one [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  tire fryer. You know, she did the burnout and you got like one stripe going about 400 [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=283.8s)]
*  feet down the road. Yeah. Yeah. Those old cars suck to drive though. Oh my God. If you [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=287.56s)]
*  drive the old ones that don't have resto mod components, like Roadster shop components, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=293.48s)]
*  they're just terrible. Yeah. They're so bad. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I saw my wife for my [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=297.48s)]
*  60th last year, my 60th birthday, she and the kids bought me a nice 69 olds 442. So [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=303.68s)]
*  it's nice enough to where I'll drive it, but not so nice that I don't want to drive it. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=309.48s)]
*  Right. And I just, man, when I drive that thing, it's the slowest least powerful thing [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=313.64s)]
*  in the, in the fleet, but I just kind of brings me back. I got this jam box I put in the backseat [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=317.48s)]
*  of the turtle box and I just turn on my AC DC and go out cruising around and you know, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=322.8s)]
*  you don't even bother to start a stereo. You know, if it dies at the stop sign or if it, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=327.8s)]
*  you know, we'll probably put an LT four and LSA in it, you know, LS swap it at some point. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  But do you think you'll do something to the chassis? You would probably need that. But [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=336.7s)]
*  you know, I like a scary ride that kind of entertains me, you know, so maybe to some [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=340.86s)]
*  degree we, I mean, we do want to have a balanced safe car, but you know, the old saying Bob [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=345.58s)]
*  Lutz, who used to be the president of Chrysler back in the day when I first met him, he had, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=350.34s)]
*  um, he was working for BMW in Germany. He had a pretty fast motorcycle and he's out tooling [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=355.18s)]
*  around Germany and some dude just rips past him on the Autobahn and he pulls into the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=360.46s)]
*  gas station. This is old guy and Bob goes up looking at his bike and it's like, is that [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=364.14s)]
*  a turbocharger on your bike? This dude, this is like the early seventies and the German [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=367.73999999999995s)]
*  guy says, yeah, yes, young man, this, it has a turbocharger. And Bob says, well, how much [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=371.78s)]
*  horsepower does that bike have? He says, well, probably 200 of the tire. And Bob's like, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=376.09999999999997s)]
*  what, 200 of the tire? He's like, isn't that too much horse? Bob is saying to this old [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=381.02s)]
*  German guy, isn't that too much horsepower? And the old guy looks at him and says, young [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=385.02s)]
*  man, there's no such thing as too much horsepower. Bob told me that story like 30 years ago. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=388.98s)]
*  I was visiting him up in Detroit. I think to some degree that's true, but it's a good [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=394.1s)]
*  story. You want to have it balanced, you want to have it safe, you know, as long as you're [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=397.5s)]
*  not there for the end, as long as you're not in the ditch, as long as you're not there [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=400.06s)]
*  for the accident. Right. The thing about motorcycles is the consequences are so grave. Well, sure. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=403.9s)]
*  Yeah, I've had a few. I've, I've busted up my knee and spent a week in the hospital when [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=409.62s)]
*  I was in high school. And I guess now the term they use, and it's to some degree true [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=413.78s)]
*  donor cycle. So yeah, my, my boys, I like to ride. We ride KTM, we ride dirt bikes up in [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=418.3s)]
*  Colorado in the summertime. But I'm like on the road, you gotta be careful because even [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=423.26s)]
*  back in the day, if you're riding, you know, they're distracted drivers. Now everybody's [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=426.65999999999997s)]
*  on their fucking phone. Nobody's paying attention to shit. So bad. You know, so there's so many [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=430.06s)]
*  people that are just addicted to their phones and they can't put them down while they're [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=434.62s)]
*  driving. It's so wild to see. Yeah. I mean, every now and then I take a car service to [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=437.94s)]
*  the airport or something. And if you're not driving, you can just like look out the window. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=442.02s)]
*  Just next time you do that, just look out the window. More than half the people are [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=445.70000000000005s)]
*  fucking not even looking at the road. They're on their phone. Yeah. They're supposed to [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=448.78000000000003s)]
*  be driving or they're putting on their makeup. One of the things I love about Apple car play [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=451.98s)]
*  is you don't have to take your hands off anything. Absolutely. Just say, Hey Siri, play. Yeah. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=455.86s)]
*  It'll play a song for you. That is the, what like I do that shit with my daughter because [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=460.3s)]
*  my daughter's in there like Taylor Swift and I don't have a Taylor Swift on my phone, but [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=464.18s)]
*  I could just while we're in the car, you want to listen to something and she brings up a [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=467.90000000000003s)]
*  song. So I just say, Hey Siri, play. And then bam, like that it's playing it. I mean, car [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=470.74s)]
*  play works really well. It's incredible. The tech, it reads your texts. It sends texts [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=476.90000000000003s)]
*  for you. It's fucking amazing. Did you ever put car play in any of your old cars? They [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=481.78000000000003s)]
*  have like retrofit kits now for that kind of stuff. Yeah, I have. But honestly, when [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=484.86s)]
*  I'm driving those old cars, I don't like to, sometimes I don't even like to listen to music. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=488.22s)]
*  I really just want to hear that engine. Sure. Sure. You know, I listen to music sometimes, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=492.38s)]
*  it always gets annoying. I want to hear that engine. I want to hear that. Yeah. You want [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=497.94s)]
*  to fucking feel that V8. It's been the terms a little bit, not too much. Yeah. I just, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=503.54s)]
*  there's something about cars that I guess it was because when I was a kid, it represented [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=509.3s)]
*  freedom, right? Because you were in high school, if you didn't have a car, you had to ride [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=515.34s)]
*  the bus. Status. Yeah. Status for sure. Chicks. Chicks for sure. Friends maybe, you know. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=519.5s)]
*  It was really more impressive for guys than it was for girls. Sure. The kinds of cars [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=524.3399999999999s)]
*  I like, girls are like, this fucking thing stinks. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Smells like gas. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=527.38s)]
*  I went to this Jesuit high school up in Kansas City called Rockhurst, and I was a little [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=531.0999999999999s)]
*  guy and total nobody. I was on the wrestling team and I think I was in the 98 pound weight [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=535.4599999999999s)]
*  class when I was a freshman. Anyway, I was a total nobody, and then I bought a motorcycle [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=539.38s)]
*  from my dad when I was like a sophomore. And I remember the first time I rolled into school, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=544.7399999999999s)]
*  I was late, and there's like this quadrangle where I could like pull right up to the door, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=548.9s)]
*  and there's all these windows that are open, and all these guys like rushed the window [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=552.5s)]
*  to hear what this loud motorcycle was. And all of a sudden I had status. All of a sudden [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=555.38s)]
*  I was not a nobody. I was like, who's the wild man and the little kid in the motorcycle? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=558.5s)]
*  That is the thing, right? If you're a kid showing up at school in a motorcycle, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=562.6600000000001s)]
*  you're a wild man. Sure. Yeah, yeah. So I had my car crashed and the guy that lived across [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=565.94s)]
*  the street from me had this Olds 442 convertible. It's kind of a crazy story. Like my old man was [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=571.14s)]
*  an insurance adjuster, and he was going to buy this car from this body shop for like a couple [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=576.58s)]
*  hundred bucks. And he told me it was going to be my first car, blah, blah, blah. And like a month [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=581.06s)]
*  goes by, I'm like, hey, dad, when are we getting that car? And he just kind of ignored me and just [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=584.66s)]
*  kind of blew me off. And the next thing I knew, the neighbor across the street had that car. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=588.5s)]
*  Wow. So the torture of I didn't get the car, and now I got to drive, go home every day on my [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=592.42s)]
*  motorcycle and look at the neighbor across the street who had the car. So when I had my motorcycle [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=597.78s)]
*  wreck, I had two bikes. So I was 16, and I'm trying to fix my bike. And the guy across the street [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=601.6999999999999s)]
*  worked at this Ford factory up in Kansas City. And he offered to help me with the bikes. And I [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=606.74s)]
*  ended up making a deal with him and I sold him. I trade him the two bikes and I paid him like 50 [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=611.14s)]
*  bucks a month for a year or something like that. And I bought the car back with my own money. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=614.9s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=618.98s)]
*  So I'm like, F you old man. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=619.38s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=620.82s)]
*  Anyway, it was fun. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=621.62s)]
*  Yeah. When you first got into cars, like what were the cars? Were you always into American cars or [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=622.82s)]
*  were you into a lot of foreign cars? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=629.3s)]
*  You know, back in the, back when, you know, most of back in the, growing up in the 70s and 80s, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=630.9s)]
*  I mean, it was all muscle cars. So, you know, you see the guy with the Chevelle or the Camaro, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=635.7s)]
*  the 70 and a half Z28. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=640.6600000000001s)]
*  How old are you? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=641.86s)]
*  I'm 60. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=642.98s)]
*  Okay. So you're a little older than me. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=643.7800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So I'm 65. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=644.9000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So I just grew up around muscle cars and then fast forward, you know, went to college for [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=645.62s)]
*  a few years, dropped out, moved from Kansas City to Texas. And back then, like the, in the 80s, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=652.26s)]
*  the German cars, they had these rally cars over in Europe and they call it, there was the Group B [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=659.5400000000001s)]
*  rally cars and they call them the killer bees because they got so fast back like in the mid to [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=664.02s)]
*  late 80s that, that the crowds would like bunch up in the road waiting for these, you know, rally [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=668.34s)]
*  cars blasting by at 120 or whatever. And they knew where the rally cars were because the helicopters [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=673.62s)]
*  were chasing them, you know, kind of spot and form or the TV camera. And then one time the cars got [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=679.6999999999999s)]
*  so fast that they would like hit the, they got ahead of the helicopters and these Group B rally [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=684.9s)]
*  cars like landing on people and killed a bunch of people. So they call them the killer bees. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=689.62s)]
*  So I was really kind of enamored with like the Audi Quattro. They went to Pike's Peak and they [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=693.06s)]
*  raced at Pike's Peak and that's really kind of what got, so I kind of, you know, shifted gears from [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=697.38s)]
*  American muscle to now kind of this higher tech German all-wheel drive turbocharged stuff. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=703.78s)]
*  And then kind of, I started a small environmental cleanup, like an asbestos abatement business back [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=709.06s)]
*  in the late 80s and made a little bit of money. I wasn't dating my wife, wasn't married yet. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=715.14s)]
*  And so I read in MotorTrend magazine about this guy named C. Van Toon. He was actually the editor [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=720.98s)]
*  of MotorTrend back in the mid to late 90s. And he had bought an Eagle Talon. This is like 1990. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=725.78s)]
*  Put a roll cage in it and he went, goes and enters the Pike's Peak Hill Climb in Colorado Springs. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=732.34s)]
*  And I read that and I'm like, oh man, my name's not Andretti or Unthra. I can't just show up to Indy, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=737.62s)]
*  but maybe I could do that. And so made a little bit of money on my asbestos business. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=742.1s)]
*  I was reading the car magazines and I'm like, I'm the kind of guy, whether it's then or now, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=747.3000000000001s)]
*  I don't really want to do what everybody else has done. I'm a contrarian by nature. And, you know, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=752.58s)]
*  if everybody else is racing Porsches or whatever, so I'm trying to find something that can afford, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=756.4200000000001s)]
*  but this high tech that I can modify to race at Pike's Peak. And I read about a car that came out [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=759.62s)]
*  that year. It was the Mitsubishi 3000 GT VR4. So it was all-wheel drive twin turbo V6, four-wheel [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=764.5s)]
*  seat, four-wheel stir. Yeah. And, um, I had a Mitsubishi Starion. Yeah, those were cool. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=772.18s)]
*  Those are coming back. That's kind of rad, red woodish 3000. Yeah. Just type in Hennessy 3000 GT. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=778.9799999999999s)]
*  Oh, you know what? Now that I'm thinking about it, I had the Dodge version of it. I had the [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=786.5799999999999s)]
*  Conquest. Oh, the Conquest. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, so you had one of those. Those things were sick. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=790.9s)]
*  Yeah. Those were cool. I loved those things when I first saw those. So I took it and raced it at [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=796.26s)]
*  Pike's Peak and didn't win anything, but, uh, those things were the shit when they came out. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=800.34s)]
*  Drove it to Pike's Peak, drove it home. I did a couple of races. If you type, type in, uh, yeah. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=805.94s)]
*  You know what's crazy? Does Mitsubishi- There you go. That Motortown article. There's Bonneville. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=811.62s)]
*  Mitsubishi doesn't make anything like that now, right? You know, Mitsubishi, they, I mean, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=815.46s)]
*  a good friend of mine, Joe Jacuzzi is with GM now. There were some really great folks at Mitsubishi [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=820.1800000000001s)]
*  and maybe they've just kind of gone to other things, but, uh, yeah, the VR 200. So that car, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=825.46s)]
*  so I learned, I learned the first rule in car racing. Well, the first rule, if you want to make [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=830.6600000000001s)]
*  a small fortune in the car racing business, you start with a larger fortune. So, and so I'm going [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=834.5s)]
*  and I'm doing these races and I'm going to Pike's Peak and I do these open road races in Nevada, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=840.1s)]
*  where you go out a night. There's a, they have a, they still have it called the Silver State Classic. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=845.7s)]
*  They take highway 318s about it's in just south of Ely, so about four hours north of Vegas, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=850.26s)]
*  and they shut the whole highway down and they let these cars go out on a Sunday morning and go out [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=856.5s)]
*  and haul ass. And so I did the first time I did it, my average speed for 90 miles was 164 miles an [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=860.8199999999999s)]
*  hour. I did, I did 90 miles in 34 minutes in that car. And, uh, you know, I did the first time I did [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=867.22s)]
*  it and even have a roll cage, which is pretty stupid. But, um, and after I did all this stuff, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=872.9s)]
*  so I'm engaged, um, planning a honeymoon. We bought a house. I like to say we bought furniture, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=877.94s)]
*  but my wife corrects me on that. We just bought, but, you know, we inherited furniture from her [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=885.0600000000001s)]
*  family or I think all I brought to the marriage was a, was a mattress and a box spring and a desk, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=889.0600000000001s)]
*  maybe, and a Mac. Anyway, so I did all that. I'm doing all these races, come home from the honeymoon [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=892.98s)]
*  and I look at the bank balance. I'm like, man, I used to have some money in the bank before I [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=899.46s)]
*  got engaged and bought a race car and race all over the place. And I thought, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=903.7s)]
*  you know, I really like doing this car thing. Maybe other people would pay me to modify their [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=908.18s)]
*  cars like Carol Shelby, like a Lois roof with Porsches, Reeves Callaway. And so, um, 19, you [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=913.14s)]
*  know, October of 1991, we opened up Hennessy motor sports and I hired a mechanic and got a toolbox [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=919.78s)]
*  and, and off we went and that kind of led into the JDM market. So what, what kind of cars are [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=926.66s)]
*  you modifying back then? Like, so yeah, he did anything that would roll in the door. And, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=931.22s)]
*  and I kind of had a little bit of notoriety from the silver state race. So, you know, it was JDM. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=935.14s)]
*  So it was Supras, 300ZX twin turbo, um, you know, so a grand national Supra. So, so the Mark 4 Supra, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=939.94s)]
*  um, you know, the, the cyclone, the, uh, the Typhoon, you know, that had like the pickup truck. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=949.14s)]
*  Yeah. That had a little 3.8 liters single, uh, single turbo V6. And so then a guy calls me up, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=954.5s)]
*  in early 93 and he said, Hey, I've got one of the first Dodge Vipers coming. It was actually a [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=961.2199999999999s)]
*  model year 92, but they had some production delays. So the car didn't come out to the spring of [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=967.3s)]
*  93. And he says, Hey, I want to, I'm going to, I bought a Viper and I want to take it to the [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=972.18s)]
*  silver state race. And I want to, if, can you help me put like the safety equipment and help [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=976.1s)]
*  with past tech? And I said, sure. I said, Oh, but I'll make you a deal. If you let me modify it, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=980.5s)]
*  I think I can get another a hundred horsepower on that Viper and I'll do it for free. I said, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=984.9s)]
*  I won't even charge you to do it. I said, the only thing I'll ask in return, I'll take you out [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=988.5s)]
*  to the race. We'll, I'll support you. We'll, I'll bring my mechanic. We'll look after your car [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=991.86s)]
*  after the race. If you'll, uh, again, my buddy, Joe Jacuzzi was with Mitsubishi at the time, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=996.1s)]
*  said, Hey, I'll take you around LA and I'll introduce you to the editor at Motor Trend and [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1001.38s)]
*  Hot Rod and Car Craft and Road and Track. And sure enough, we did all that. And we, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1005.38s)]
*  I initially did it with my 3000 GT. Got some articles off of it. And I'm like, when I was [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1009.54s)]
*  doing that back in the early nineties, I go, this is before social media. This is before YouTube, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1014.26s)]
*  no internet. And so that's the only, you know, the only way we knew about car stuff is we did [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1018.8199999999999s)]
*  car magazines, right? And so I'm doing all this for a couple of weeks with Joe and going around. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1023.14s)]
*  I'm thinking, man, I've been gone a long time. I did this race. I go to talk to all these media guys [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1026.98s)]
*  and just like, just be patient when the magazine comes out, if they, they like you and they like [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1031.14s)]
*  your car and they write something nice about it, your phone will ring. And sure enough, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1035.54s)]
*  phones start ringing. And so I did all that with the Viper. And then how'd you get a hundred more [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1038.74s)]
*  horsepower out of it? You know, the Viper is a big, you know, eight liter V10. And so back in those [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1042.82s)]
*  days, the exhaust system sound like a UPS truck. They still kind of sound weird. It's two five [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1049.78s)]
*  cylinders basically is what it sounds like. So we freed up the exhaust. We did a cold air intake. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1054.34s)]
*  We poured and polished the head. So we got, we bumped it to at least 500 horsepower. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1059.9399999999998s)]
*  Then we started doing cams and stroker motors and eventually turbos and basically from [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1064.34s)]
*  from 93 through for the next 10 years into the early 2000s, I would say we were on the covers of [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1069.46s)]
*  30, 40 magazines, including all the major book books. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1077.38s)]
*  Isn't it crazy when you think about the progression of cars and power that if you go back to the [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1080.2600000000002s)]
*  original Viper, it wasn't really that fast. Now compared to today, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1084.74s)]
*  what did it have horsepower wise? The original was 400 and then they went to 450. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1088.74s)]
*  So 400 is like, I mean, you get a regular Mustang GT, you're getting 460. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1092.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. The new dark horse would be 500. And I mean, you could, you could take a, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1098.5s)]
*  you know, Tesla, you know, model three and be to be at an old Viper. I mean, back in the day, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1102.5s)]
*  but it was so torquey and it was just so outrageous. And back, it was raw. It was raw. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1107.7s)]
*  It was no anti-mock brakes. That's true. It was kind of scary. We [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1111.22s)]
*  splat spotted a lot of tires, but, but, you know, pretty, pretty cool car for back in the day. And [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1114.5800000000002s)]
*  again, me being the contrarian, there are plenty of other guys out there modifying Corvettes and [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1119.6200000000001s)]
*  Mustangs and things like that. Of course. I'm the guy that wants to be different. So if you guys [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1123.54s)]
*  are modifying those vehicles, I'm going to modify the Viper. And so that just kind of built up our, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1126.82s)]
*  so our business kind of grew from a, just a small tuning shop to a larger scale tuning shop. And [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1131.78s)]
*  then we added it up, well, maybe a year ago. That's from 91 through about a year ago. We [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1137.1399999999999s)]
*  had modified about 15,000 vehicles worldwide. Yeah. Wow. We did mail order for a while and some of [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1142.98s)]
*  that was mail order, but last year we built, we modified 564 vehicles last year. So when did you [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1148.1799999999998s)]
*  start getting to the shit you're doing now? Like, you know, you've made me a 1,000 horsepower TRX. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1154.5s)]
*  That car is so stupid. It is. It is so stupid. But it's so, the problem is- And the brakes are good? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1160.82s)]
*  Cause I was worried that you would end up in the back of the 18 wheeler. The upgrade, no. I drive it very [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1166.42s)]
*  responsibly, believe it or not. I don't, I just love the fact that it has so much power. And it sounds [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1170.26s)]
*  great. Oh, it sounds amazing. It's very comfortable. Yeah. And also because it's high up, you get a [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1174.9s)]
*  great vantage point. You get to see accidents before they happen. Great vantage point. If you're stuck in the highway [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1179.38s)]
*  and there's some rack, you can just go through the grass and go into the feeder road. Yeah, you really [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1183.22s)]
*  could do that. I mean, trucks are, I mean, the other thing is like, like when I'm driving like my older cars, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1186.9s)]
*  like I've got a Cadillac CTS-V wagon manual and I'm pulling out of a store and some lady at Christmas [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1191.06s)]
*  a couple of years ago runs into me cause she didn't see me. So I do like, like driving something bigger [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1196.74s)]
*  like that because if they run into you, it's not going to do that much. And they generally see you [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1200.98s)]
*  and want to not run into you. My Land Cruiser, well, this, this, the TRX has steel bumpers too. Yeah. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1205.3s)]
*  My Land Cruiser also has rock sliders. Yeah. On the side of it. And so because it's lifted, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1210.6599999999999s)]
*  if someone's going to T-bone me, they're going right into the rock sliders. Yeah. It's going to be worse for them than it is [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1214.74s)]
*  for you for sure. It's just, there's so many f*****g bad drivers out there. Well, you know, we could talk at [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1218.58s)]
*  length about that, but I think a lot of that boils down to, like, if you look at Europe, you look at Germany, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1224.74s)]
*  getting a driver's license in Germany is a serious deal. It takes two years. It costs about $2,500. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1230.5s)]
*  Getting your driver's license in Germany, there's Germans are so serious and they're serious about [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1236.8200000000002s)]
*  their cars and about their driving and about the Autobahn, but getting the driver's license in [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1241.46s)]
*  Germany is similar to like getting a private pilot's license over here. Wow. Yeah. And so, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1245.6200000000001s)]
*  so why don't we do that over here? Well, that would be a higher barrier for a lot of people. And so, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1250.42s)]
*  you know, car companies want to sell cars, insurance companies want to sell insurance. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1254.98s)]
*  Also, like maybe people don't need to learn how to drive that good. They just need to pay attention [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1258.74s)]
*  and don't go fast. Yeah, that's true. I mean, I don't know if it's speed, but it's just, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1263.46s)]
*  it's paying attention. You know, I mean, our kids all just, you know, in the last 10 years, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1267.6200000000001s)]
*  all went through drivers that and I think they got, you know, some decent training. But, you know, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1271.6200000000001s)]
*  to your point, like lane discipline, like, you know, if you're the slowest guy out there, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1276.18s)]
*  get in the right lane. Yeah. You know, if you're the, if you're going a little bit faster, you go [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1280.02s)]
*  on the inside lane, but just that, you know, that drives any serious driver crazy is when somebody's [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1282.9s)]
*  on the left lane going 49, which is, that doesn't bother me. Okay. It does bother me, but it doesn't [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1287.14s)]
*  bother me. Like not paying attention, the not paying attention thing, the distracted drivers. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1292.9s)]
*  Right. It's wild. Yeah. Well, and I would put some, I would put some of that on the OEMs. I think [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1296.3400000000001s)]
*  the OEMs to some degree, try to make the cars like nannies, like whether it's autopilot or adaptive [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1300.8200000000002s)]
*  steering. I think I had a friend of mine's dad when I was in high school, I'll never forget. He said, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1306.3400000000001s)]
*  Hey kid, you know, if you want to stay alive, don't use, if you're driving at night, don't use [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1311.46s)]
*  your cruise control. I'm like, well, why not? Well, you set your cruise control, you got your tunes [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1315.3000000000002s)]
*  going to your little tired, you fall asleep in the ditch. Right. Yeah. So I think that, you know, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1319.38s)]
*  I would almost say that to some degree that the nannies to try to protect drivers all of a sudden [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1323.7s)]
*  become, well, maybe I can crawl in the back seat and take a nap. You know, here's, here's a tip [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1328.98s)]
*  for anybody that might be driving and you're worried you're going to fall asleep. Get, bring [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1333.5400000000002s)]
*  a washcloth with you and ice cubes, like get a wet washcloth and then put ice cubes in that washcloth [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1337.94s)]
*  and just rub your face. Okay. It'll keep you awake the whole time. It's not painful. It's ice to slap [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1344.3400000000001s)]
*  myself in the face. That's what I used to do. You'd be out on a road trip and trying to drive [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1349.22s)]
*  through the night. I've done all that. It's because I was doing standup comedy at night and I was [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1353.8600000000001s)]
*  delivering newspapers in the morning. So I was always fucking tired. We've got a lot of things. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1358.02s)]
*  Deliver newspapers? Fuck yeah, I did. Which one? I was 12 years old, Kansas city star. Nice. And dude, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1362.42s)]
*  I mean, I'm getting up at like 3 45, 4 AM delivering papers for two, two and a half hours. And dude, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1367.7s)]
*  on a Sunday, which is- Shoot on your bike? No, I'm in the back of this paper truck and this guy had [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1374.74s)]
*  the route and then we would have to roll the paper and put in this machine and crank this thing. It [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1379.78s)]
*  would tie a little knot with some string around it and fucking toss it out the window where we're [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1384.98s)]
*  going by. Dogs are barking at you and it's snowing and it's cold. And then I'd be the, I would do [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1389.06s)]
*  some of that, but all of a sudden there'd be an apartment complex. Well, here's your stack of [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1394.34s)]
*  papers and I'm out tossing them at people's doorsteps and on a juicy day, we might make like $3.25. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1397.3s)]
*  And so what we do, we go to 7-Eleven and we blow half the cash on fricking nasty burritos and big [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1404.82s)]
*  gulps and crap like that. But that was just kind of what we did. But that's, I mean, that's what [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1411.7s)]
*  we had to do to make- So you're doing papers while you're doing stand-up. Yeah, I was doing [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1415.46s)]
*  newspapers from the time, I guess I was probably like 17 or 18 when I first started it. Maybe it [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1419.54s)]
*  was a little, yeah, somewhere around that range. And I did it for the Boston Herald, I did it for [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1429.7s)]
*  the Boston Globe and I did it for the New York Times. Nice. And so I had, at one point down, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1434.82s)]
*  I had a huge route and I even got a van. I had like a cargo van. So you had your own deal, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1439.94s)]
*  you weren't working for somebody else. No, I was working for a dispatch. So you would get a job [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1444.42s)]
*  working for the Globe and you'd go to the dispatch and they'd give you a route. So they give you a [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1448.98s)]
*  map and all the houses that are on it, all the addresses. And then they would give you stacks of [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1453.8600000000001s)]
*  newspapers and you had to fold them while you're driving. So you're driving, you pull up in front [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1459.46s)]
*  of the house, I had a stack of papers right next to me and I would just go like this, grab it, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1463.38s)]
*  zap, zap, and I had these plastic bags that were hanging from my rear view mirror. So I'd go, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1467.54s)]
*  wham, wham, and then chuck it out the window. Yeah, I think we started going to the plastic. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1473.22s)]
*  So I did it from, I was probably 12 to maybe 14. And then one of my relatives was in a hospital [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1477.94s)]
*  in South Kansas City, St. Joe's. And I found out that they did not have a paper route in the [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1484.1000000000001s)]
*  hospital and I was able to kind of get that. I was able to get that franchise. I was making like [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1488.9s)]
*  back in the day, maybe 80 bucks a week, which is pretty good money back then. Yeah, I was doing [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1492.98s)]
*  so many newspapers that I actually was, that was the primary money that I was making. So this was [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1497.3000000000002s)]
*  when I wasn't really making much money teaching. And you were a teacher too? I used to teach [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1502.3400000000001s)]
*  martial arts. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So I was, I actually used to teach at Boston university. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1507.38s)]
*  Okay. It was actually a pass fail A. So it counted towards your GPA. Okay. So I would tell everybody [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1511.8600000000001s)]
*  if you just try, you'll get an A and it's a real A. So just try, just show up and try. I like your [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1518.34s)]
*  story when those guys were following you and fucking with you and you're like, Hey, you want [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1524.58s)]
*  to come up to the dojo? Oh, that was hilarious. That was so dumb. They, but. You want to get your ass [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1527.22s)]
*  whipped? Come on. It was hilarious. Cause they were, they just kept saying that I needed to give them [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1532.74s)]
*  money. And then I said, and then where are you going? I'm like, I'm going to go teach class. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1536.58s)]
*  Yeah. You want to come up and watch? Yeah. Right. You want to come be there? And like they're standing [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1539.86s)]
*  there in front of the Jae-Hun Kim Taekwondo Institute and they're looking at me. They're like, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1543.3799999999999s)]
*  you're teaching? I go, yeah. Yeah. I'm a black belt and teaching class. I'll fucking kill you, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1547.38s)]
*  man. Leave me alone. Don't make me kill you. Exactly. It was so funny. It was like the least [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1552.1000000000001s)]
*  nervous I've ever been. Like as a young man. It was like the perfect, like it was like the whole [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1557.94s)]
*  reason why I got into fighting at all is because I was terrified of being bullied. And so to have [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1563.6200000000001s)]
*  this moment happen while I'm walking on the street and these two guys start fucking with me and, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1568.42s)]
*  and I'm not rattled at all. Yeah. And then I get to that door and I tell them. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1573.06s)]
*  I saw the video. I just laughed my ass off. That was awesome. So when you were doing, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1580.58s)]
*  so you started off in MMA or you start off in Jiu-Jitsu. I started off in Taekwondo. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1585.3s)]
*  Taekwondo. Yeah. Well, I started off in karate first. I went to Esposito's, a karate academy, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1589.14s)]
*  which was in Newton, Massachusetts, where I lived. But it was hard to get there. I didn't have a car [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1594.42s)]
*  and it was like, you had to take buses. It was, it was a grind to get there, but [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1598.58s)]
*  Boston was pretty easy. I just had to walk to the T, which was like, I had to walk a mile and a half [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1603.06s)]
*  or something like that. And then I would get to the T, which was the train that would take me right [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1607.3s)]
*  into Kenmore square, which is right where the school was. From the time you started, the time [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1611.62s)]
*  you felt like you had some skills or a little bit of confidence, how long did that take? Six months? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1616.8999999999999s)]
*  Well, I was obsessed. I mean, when I started, when I was 15, I was there every day. I mean, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1621.3s)]
*  every day. I didn't take any days off. I was obsessed and I became a black belt in two years. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1630.34s)]
*  No shit. Wow. Yeah. I was teaching like almost right away, like right after, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1636.82s)]
*  I think when I got my blue belt, I started teaching private lessons. Like for the new [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1644.58s)]
*  beginners, I teach them form and stances and how to get your hips into things. And I was just [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1650.26s)]
*  teaching them like basics. And that helped me a lot because there's something about teaching [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1655.86s)]
*  that like really sort of accelerates your own learning curve. Interesting. And so I was obsessed [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1662.02s)]
*  with it and I was, I was competing already. I started competing like right away when I was [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1667.94s)]
*  white belt. So you're what 16, 15? 15. All right. And so, you know, they would take you to these [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1672.1s)]
*  tournaments. Like, so all you had to do is like be at the school and everybody would sort of carpool. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1678.42s)]
*  And then when I was a kid, it was like, they would kind of take care of me and bring me to these [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1682.3400000000001s)]
*  places. And you're in this fucking gymnasium and there's this other dude across from you and you're [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1686.66s)]
*  about to try to kick each other unconscious. This is wild. And I became obsessed with it because it [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1693.54s)]
*  was so insane. It was like to go from like regular life, you know, just being a kid, I like to draw, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1700.26s)]
*  I was an artist. So all of a sudden I'm like traveling around the country, fighting. It was so [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1706.18s)]
*  nerve wracking and so hard to do. It was so challenging. It was such a freak out to do it. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1712.66s)]
*  And I became so obsessed with it. Did you have an instructor that like really like invested into you? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1718.18s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. I had several, but this guy, Michael O'Malley in particular, and this guy, Jae-Hun Kim, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1723.14s)]
*  who is the, he's the head instructor of the Institute. And he was like a very famous [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1729.86s)]
*  Taekwondo instructor. I got very, very lucky. When I went to that place in 1980, whatever it was, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1736.58s)]
*  one or two, when I first went there, it was one of the best schools in the world. I'd fortunately [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1744.74s)]
*  walked in that door. I could have walked into a bad karate school. I would have known the difference. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1752.26s)]
*  Sure. Right. What the fuck would I know? But I happened to go, I walked up, I was actually [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1758.02s)]
*  leaving a baseball game and I was going, I told the story. I'm sorry if people have read it before, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1761.3799999999999s)]
*  but I was going home and there's a long line to get to the tee because everybody was leaving [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1765.86s)]
*  Fenway Park. Yeah. And so we walked by the school and I said, let's go up and see what the fuck's [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1771.7s)]
*  going on up here. And we walked up the stairs and as I was walking up the stairs, I kept hearing [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1776.18s)]
*  the sound. And it was this guy, John Lee, who became a mentor of mine. And he was a national [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1779.94s)]
*  champion at the time and he was training for the world cup. And I think he was 27 or 28 years old. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1789.22s)]
*  So he was in his absolute prime. And I got to see this guy kick the bag and I couldn't believe it. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1794.66s)]
*  It was the force that he was generating. Well, that's you. That's you now. Like, I mean, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1802.66s)]
*  I've seen videos, I haven't seen you train in person. I'm like, it's like, you know, one [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1807.86s)]
*  whack of your leg and you got some broken ribs. Yeah. But I learned it from that guy. I mean, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1811.62s)]
*  I learned it from, I mean, he most certainly helped me many, many, many times, but watching him, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1816.74s)]
*  I learned it from, I mean, I learned that that was possible. Like I never known that a person could [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1823.1399999999999s)]
*  do that. Like the amount of force. I was like, that is insane. So you were doing that and you [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1827.3799999999999s)]
*  were doing, tossing newspapers around the same time. Yes. So newspapers was your income source, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1831.9399999999998s)]
*  but finding was your passion and cost some money for travel or whatever. It was a good way. Once I [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1837.46s)]
*  got out of high school, it was a good way to generate some money while I was doing this crazy [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1842.1s)]
*  thing where I was trying to make the Olympic team for Taekwondo. Really? Okay. Yeah. So I was [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1846.26s)]
*  competing. I won the Massachusetts state championship, like four years in a row. And I was competing [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1851.7s)]
*  in the nationals and I never, I couldn't win the nationals. I got close. I came close a couple of [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1857.14s)]
*  times and I got in the finals of the U S cup with this guy, uh, Kareem Jabbar, who was the national [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1861.86s)]
*  champion. It was a very disputed close decision that I thought I could have got. So I was at that [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1866.9799999999998s)]
*  level. I was like right close, but unfortunately then I started kickboxing. And when I started [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1872.34s)]
*  kickboxing immediately, I realized how helpless I was against someone who had really, really good [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1878.02s)]
*  hands. I was getting fucked up kickboxing. Okay. And then I kind of lost my faith in Taekwondo [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1883.1399999999999s)]
*  because I realized how limited it was because they don't punch to the face. Okay. So you get like, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1889.3s)]
*  it's, you get the most amazing leg dexterity because you're learning how to primarily learn [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1893.6200000000001s)]
*  how to kick. They have some of the best kicks, but you're so limited in your ability to defend [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1899.7s)]
*  your face from punches. Because when punches and kicks are thrown together to your face, it makes [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1905.3s)]
*  things so much more complex. And when I was learning that I was like, I lost like some of my faith [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1909.78s)]
*  in Taekwondo. So I had a few kickboxing fights and then I was doing standup at the same time. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1914.58s)]
*  And I knew I had to pick one or the other. Where did standup kick, where did standup come [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1919.62s)]
*  into that whole program? How were you when you started with that? Well, I was thinking about it [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1924.02s)]
*  when I was like 19 or 20. Okay. And you wrote your own stuff? Yeah. Okay. Just like it was horrible. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1927.1399999999999s)]
*  Right. Yeah. But you're the kind of guy that like, you don't mind, you know, you put your balls out [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1934.26s)]
*  there and you won't mind getting punished for something you want to try. Well, I was just [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1938.8999999999999s)]
*  curious. Like I'd seen, this is what it was. I have a very good friend to this day, his name is [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1943.06s)]
*  Steve Graham. He's a good buddy of mine. And Steve, when I was 15, when I met him, he was an [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1948.58s)]
*  ophthalmologist. And like he'd been on the US ski team, like a fucking wild man. Just done a lot of [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1956.02s)]
*  stuff. Like super, super duper smart. Right. And you know, he was like in his thirties and I was [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1963.06s)]
*  like 15. And we used to train together all the time. And when we would go and fight in tournaments, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1967.62s)]
*  I was the guy who made everybody laugh because everybody would be nervous. We would be all scared [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1973.2199999999998s)]
*  because we're going to go fight. Yeah. Or when we're about to spar, everyone would be super nervous [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1977.78s)]
*  because sparring was scary. Yeah. Yeah. And I was the guy who like, you could cut up and crack jokes. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1981.78s)]
*  Cause I realized that there was like tension in the room and then I could get attention [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1987.1399999999999s)]
*  from cracking that tension. I could get attention from like making everybody laugh. And so I start, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1990.82s)]
*  I would do like impressions of guys we knew having sex and like just stupid shit. And it was so dumb. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=1996.42s)]
*  But Steve is the one who told me, uh, Steve and this other guy, Ed Shorter, was a friend of mine too. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2002.42s)]
*  And he just said, you really should be, you should do stand up. Like you could do it. I'm like, dude, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2009.0600000000002s)]
*  you think I'm funny because you know me. I'm like, people are going to think I'm an asshole. Like my [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2014.26s)]
*  sense of humor is so fucked up. But so then I went to an open mic night. And when you go to open mic [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2018.18s)]
*  night, one of the things that's good about open mic nights is like if you compare yourself to like [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2023.62s)]
*  Bill Burr or Dave Chappelle, it's like, it'll blow your mind. You won't be able, you can't imagine [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2028.1799999999998s)]
*  ever reaching that level. But if you go to an open mic night, you realize, oh, these people are [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2033.4599999999998s)]
*  terrible. Yeah. So I might have sucked that bad. Everybody's terrible when they first start. That's [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2037.9399999999998s)]
*  funny. Me included. I was terrible. And so when you're around these terrible comedians, you realize [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2043.2199999999998s)]
*  like, oh, okay, this is like, this is how it works. Like, and then when I was at an open mic night, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2048.18s)]
*  the first time a couple of like real top level pros stopped by and did sets. Like this guy, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2054.58s)]
*  Teddy Bergeron, who did the Tonight Show back in the day. And he was like, he had some substance [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2059.62s)]
*  abuse problems. But I'm telling you, in 1988, there was no one was better. There was people that are [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2065.3799999999997s)]
*  at that level, but no one was. He was so smooth, so polished. And his material was so interesting [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2071.7799999999997s)]
*  and funny. And I remember I had done my stupid little set. I barely got a few laughs, right? [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2077.38s)]
*  And then I was like, maybe I could do this. Maybe I could do this. And then I went out and watched [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2082.34s)]
*  that guy. I was like, I should just quit now. He went up and just, it was so polished. It was so, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2085.54s)]
*  it was, he was in such like ease on stage. But he'd done it a thousand times. Oh, a thousand times. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2092.5s)]
*  So this was, and he was in his prime. Right. He had one of the best sets I've ever seen on a [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2098.5s)]
*  Tonight Show. He was incredible. But then he went off the rails. He went off the rails and he just [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2102.9s)]
*  had some problems. So did you learn how to deal with hecklers early on? Oh yeah. You always got [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2108.82s)]
*  to learn how to deal with hecklers. You're going to learn. Well, you're going to have some moments [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2112.98s)]
*  where you fall apart. You're going to have some moments where it works out great. It's a long, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2118.34s)]
*  bloody process. I compare it to trying to build a mountain one layer of paint at a time. Oh, shit. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2123.14s)]
*  It takes so long. It takes so long. It's so brutal. But it was, to me it was, it was a way [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2130.02s)]
*  that I could like exist in the world that wasn't a regular job. Like I was, whatever it is, it's ADD [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2137.54s)]
*  or whatever the fuck I am. I just couldn't sit still. And I couldn't be involved in anything [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2145.46s)]
*  that didn't freak me out. I like, I only wanted to be involved in things that scared me. So you're [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2151.1400000000003s)]
*  the original fear factor then. They cast you for a reason on that deal. They cast me against one, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2155.7s)]
*  a couple of the producers didn't want to cast me because I was making fun of it. I went in and [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2161.54s)]
*  when I did the audition for it, they wanted it to be scary. Like fear is not a factor for you. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2166.8999999999996s)]
*  They were interviewing like sportscaster type dudes too. And I went in there and I thought [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2172.5s)]
*  like this is, I was, I had a deal with NBC and I think it was to do a sitcom. I'm pretty sure it [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2178.5s)]
*  was. And so I went in to talk to them and they said, we have this thing. I was like, what are [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2184.42s)]

*  show in Holland. It was called Now or Neverland. I think that was what it was called. And so this [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2197.94s)]
*  company bought it and then they put it on TV in America and they needed a host. And then, you know, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2204.1s)]

*  manager to this day when I was an open micer in Boston. And then he moved me out to New York. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2247.3799999999997s)]
*  So I lived in New York for a few years. Then I got a development deal to do a sitcom. Then I came out [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2252.4199999999996s)]

*  Difficult shit. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2282.74s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's right. Yeah. Yeah. What Kennedy say, we don't do these things because they're easy. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2283.62s)]
*  We do them because they're hard. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2287.62s)]
*  Because they are hard. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2288.98s)]
*  Hard. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2289.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2291.14s)]

*  So when I moved to LA, like I fucking hated it. But I could go to hard times. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2291.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2297.46s)]
*  And that was to me, like there was two places that were. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2297.86s)]
*  So there was like comedy club? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2300.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2302.02s)]
*  No, no, no. Comedy store was the Mecca for stand up. But hard times was the Mecca for pool. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2302.5s)]
*  Hard times. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2308.42s)]
*  Really? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2309.1400000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah. That's where Keith McCready came from. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2309.46s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2311.38s)]

*  Okay. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2315.1400000000003s)]
*  And you'd go down there and I would compete in the Sunday tournament. I mean, I never, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2315.78s)]
*  it came close to winning it, but I would get in it all the time and get my nut shot in. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2319.86s)]
*  But you could play Rodolfo Lujan. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2324.1s)]

*  How cool. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2329.7s)]
*  You could play John Mora. You could play just stone cold killers in an open tournament. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2330.02s)]
*  You could play Efren Reyes. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2335.46s)]
*  Wow. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2336.8199999999997s)]
*  Like it's just a random draw. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2337.22s)]
*  So you go in there and then there's a field of, I don't know how many players before it fills up. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2339.22s)]

*  Right. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2344.42s)]

*  dad Ernesto Dominguez. Killer. This is like killer. Morrow Piaz. These guys were killers. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2349.94s)]
*  And you would go there and watch literally the best pool in the world. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2356.58s)]
*  Wow. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2360.1s)]
*  All in Bellflower, California. And there was a lot of gambling matches. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2360.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2363.62s)]

*  Okay. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2370.1s)]
*  That and going to, there's a few other places that I went. House of Billiards in Sherman Oaks is a [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2370.5s)]
*  great place. It was a great pool there. Hollywood Billiards in Hollywood is a good spot. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2374.34s)]
*  I played there. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2377.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2378.58s)]

*  Wow. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2431.6200000000003s)]

*  We need someone to do interviews. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2438.1800000000003s)]
*  And my manager said, Joe is obsessed. He watches them all. He's really obsessed with it. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2439.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2446.9s)]

*  And so next thing you know, I'm on these fucking puddle jumper planes flying to all these weird, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2455.46s)]
*  because it was totally illegal in most states. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2461.38s)]
*  And this was like- [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2463.2200000000003s)]
*  97. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2464.34s)]
*  Yeah. They had like those, I think what, Dana bought it from the guys that did the [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2464.98s)]
*  Bob Meyer Woods. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2469.86s)]
*  The whole thing in the bar where they beat the crap out of each other. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2470.5s)]
*  This was before Dana owned it. This was Bob Meyer Woods. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2473.78s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2476.1800000000003s)]
*  Yes. I worked for SEG, which was the original company. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2476.7400000000002s)]
*  So it was long before the Fertitta brothers came along with Dana and all that. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2479.38s)]
*  Yes, long before. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2481.78s)]
*  That's how I got back into it. I quit. I did it for about a year and a half, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2482.1800000000003s)]
*  maybe two years I did backstage interviews. And then there was an event in Japan. I'm like, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2486.5800000000004s)]
*  I'm not going to Japan. I don't have any time. It was literally, it was costing me money. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2490.9s)]
*  I love doing it, but I could make more money doing a comedy club on the weekend. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2495.46s)]
*  They weren't making any money, so how are they going to pay you any money? [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2500.58s)]
*  Exactly. There was no money to be made. There was no money for the fighters. I mean, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2503.06s)]
*  I wasn't getting screwed. It was just, that's all it was. We would go to these half-filled [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2507.2999999999997s)]
*  high school auditoriums. There was no one- [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2512.1s)]
*  Because a lot of states were banning it and stuff like that back then? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2514.58s)]
*  Yeah. It was very hard to get sanctioned. That's why we had to go to like Dothan, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2516.74s)]
*  Alabama. It got banned in New York actually. My first event was supposed to be in New York, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2520.2599999999998s)]
*  but they banned it in New York right before they did the event. And they moved the event [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2525.94s)]
*  very quickly, like overnight to Dothan, Alabama. Were the boxing promoters trying to shut it down? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2529.86s)]
*  Yes, 100%. 100%. And there was also like, there was a lot of, there's so much shenanigans that [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2534.18s)]
*  goes on. There's unions, there's- Right. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2539.62s)]
*  You know, there's- If you're not paying them, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2541.54s)]
*  they're not going to let you play. 100%. That's how the UFC stayed out of New York State forever. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2542.82s)]
*  Okay. The UFC just got in New York legally. God, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2547.38s)]
*  how many years ago was it? It wasn't that long. Wow. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2552.9s)]
*  Like crazy recent. Really? [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2555.86s)]
*  Yeah. Crazy recent. It doesn't make any sense. It was in every other state it was legal. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2557.38s)]
*  2015, 16, wasn't that? Somewhere around then, right? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2560.9s)]
*  Wow. Let's see what the actual- [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2563.62s)]
*  I mean, I never thought about the politics of it until we were just chatting about it in life. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2565.54s)]
*  Well, back then it was like, it was scary. Like, what is this? No one knew what it was. You [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2568.42s)]
*  didn't have all these years and years of guys like Hoyce Gracie and George St. Pierre and [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2573.94s)]
*  Kamaru Usman. We didn't have anything to draw from. 2016, which is so crazy. New York, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2578.1s)]
*  the last state to approve it. New York. That's crazy. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2583.54s)]
*  Because they're dirty. Politics. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2586.1s)]
*  Yeah. The guy who was holding it back, I believe he got arrested for corruption. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2587.7s)]
*  See if that's true. Wow. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2592.98s)]
*  There was a senator that he got busted for some shenanigans, but he was part of the problem, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2595.62s)]
*  holding it back. Right. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2604.1s)]
*  But in the beginning I could see why they would hold it back. You're watching these guys headbutt [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2605.3s)]
*  each other. Right. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2609.54s)]
*  They could kick in the nuts. Well, I remember just seeing all the [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2610.42s)]
*  blood and everything. Crazy. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2612.34s)]
*  Remember they used to do the foot stomping and all that? [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2614.1000000000004s)]
*  Well, foot stomping is still legal. Oh, they can still do that? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2616.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2617.78s)]
*  But what you would see back then was like nut shots. You were allowed to punch people in the nuts. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2618.5s)]
*  Wow. Brutal. I'm just straight up street fight. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2623.0600000000004s)]
*  There's a fight with Keith Hackney and Joe Son, and Keith Hackney is on top of Joe Son, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2625.94s)]
*  and Joe Son is like cranking on his neck, and Keith Hackney's just punched him in the nuts. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2630.5800000000004s)]
*  He's wearing a cup. He's wearing a cup. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2634.9s)]
*  Oh, he is? Yeah, but even so, whatever. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2636.66s)]
*  Yeah, right. You're still getting punched in the nuts. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2638.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, right. Even if you have a cup on, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2640.58s)]
*  it hurts like hell. Yeah, yeah. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2641.54s)]
*  Back in those days, I kind of understand why someone who didn't understand what was going on [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2644.18s)]
*  would think this should be illegal. Yeah. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2648.42s)]
*  I totally get it. Right. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2650.58s)]
*  And it was like they had to develop rules. So they developed weight classes, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2652.58s)]
*  then they developed rules. But I was kind of already on the way out by then. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2656.02s)]
*  And so in 98-ish, 99, I quit. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2659.94s)]
*  And then the UFC got purchased by Zuffa. And that was in 2001. And I went to one of their first [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2664.42s)]
*  events. Vladimir Matyushenko fought Tito Ortiz, and it was right after September 11th. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2671.62s)]
*  And Tito Ortiz, they used to have these elaborate walk-ins with lights and fire and shit. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2677.46s)]
*  And Tito Ortiz is walking into the Octagon with an American flag. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2682.2599999999998s)]
*  And the place goes wild. Just wild. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2687.22s)]
*  That's cool. Because it was right after September 11th. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2690.5s)]
*  Sure. It was like, holy shit. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2694.1s)]
*  People needed a break from all of that serious stuff. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2695.3s)]
*  And during that fight, the pay-per-view went out. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2698.5s)]
*  And the people didn't get to see the last rounds of the main event. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2701.86s)]
*  Oh, no. It was a huge disaster. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2706.82s)]
*  The UFC had to give back who knows how much money. Because it was like their big event [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2708.58s)]
*  in Vegas, and the pay-per-view fucked up. So Dana bought it yet at this point? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2713.06s)]
*  It was the Zuffa, which was the Fettitta Brothers and Dana. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2717.7000000000003s)]
*  Okay. They're the organization that bought it. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2721.54s)]
*  So the Fettitta Brothers bought it. And then Dana was running it. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2723.06s)]
*  And this was the very early stages. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2726.18s)]
*  And there was no TV to speak of that was showing the UFC. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2727.7799999999997s)]
*  They had to get this deal on Spike TV to put it on television. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2734.74s)]
*  That was like years in. So this was like 2005. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2737.94s)]
*  So we're like four years later, these guys are hemorrhaging money [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2741.7799999999997s)]
*  trying to make this thing happen. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2745.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2746.9s)]
*  And when that was going on, nobody took it seriously. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2747.62s)]
*  Everybody thought it was just like... [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2752.5s)]
*  Isn't that when they came up with the idea of Ultimate Fighter? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2753.94s)]
*  Is that kind of what turned the corner for them? [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2756.5s)]
*  They paid for everything. They paid to put the show on. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2758.34s)]
*  I think they even bought out the ads. And they took care of the whole thing. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2761.38s)]
*  They put it on television. It was like a Hail Mary. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2765.46s)]
*  And it was a fucking touchdown. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2767.78s)]
*  Wow. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2769.54s)]
*  And Stefan Bonner, rest in peace, he just died. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2770.18s)]
*  And Forrest Griffin had the most insane fight in the finals of the Ultimate Fighter. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2774.5s)]
*  Wow. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2778.98s)]
*  And people were just calling friends up, you got to watch this. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2779.46s)]
*  This is insane because the viewership skyrockets during the fight because it's so wild. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2783.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2788.42s)]
*  And that fight made the UFC. That fight made the sport. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2789.06s)]
*  Really? [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2793.38s)]
*  Because then people are like, what is this? [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2793.78s)]
*  Then they put on another event. And the other event got fucking huge. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2796.34s)]
*  And then Chuck Liddell came onto the scene. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2799.46s)]
*  And when Chuck Liddell was the champion, Chuck Liddell was so fucking terrifying. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2801.94s)]
*  He was this do or die berserker. He would just come at you, just swing in bombs, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2807.38s)]
*  take one on the chin, knock dudes out. His fights were wild. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2814.1s)]
*  He didn't give a shit. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2817.86s)]
*  He was the real reason why the UFC became uber popular because you would watch [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2818.6600000000003s)]
*  the Ultimate Fighter. It was a wild fight, a great fight. But then you need a destroyer. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2824.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2829.2200000000003s)]
*  You need a destroyer. And that destroyer was Chuck Liddell. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2829.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2831.86s)]
*  For the run where he was at the top, where Chuck Liddell was just murking people. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2832.1s)]
*  So he was kind of like the Michael Jordan in that he basically took the sport to another level? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2836.66s)]
*  Well, you know, he was an exceptional champion. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2841.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2844.42s)]
*  But I wouldn't say he was the Michael Jordan. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2844.98s)]
*  Okay, fair enough. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2846.74s)]
*  He had the most fan-friendly style you could ever imagine. He would just come after dudes [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2849.7799999999997s)]
*  and smash people. He was never trying to win decisions. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2854.58s)]
*  Chuck Liddell was trying to send you into the dream world. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2857.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2860.8199999999997s)]
*  That became the UFC. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2862.3399999999997s)]
*  He was an entertainer. He was Maximus the... [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2863.06s)]
*  Yes. When he would win, he would throw his arms back like this. It was crazy. See if you get a [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2866.74s)]
*  video of Chuck Liddell knocking someone out and then celebrating because it was like this iconic [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2873.54s)]
*  primal rage celebration. And when, you know, you can only fight like that for so long. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2878.34s)]
*  Sure. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2883.54s)]
*  Here's the reality... [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2883.86s)]
*  Take the toll. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2884.82s)]
*  ...of physical damage on the body and the kind of sparring that you have to do to fight like that. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2885.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2890.1s)]
*  But when he did it, my God, it was glorious. His fights when he knocked out Tito Ortiz, [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2890.82s)]
*  like, oh my God, he was a monster. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2895.7000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2898.26s)]
*  He was a monster. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2898.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2899.38s)]
*  He was just smashing people and he was a really good wrestler too. So good luck taking him down. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2899.78s)]
*  Wow. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2903.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. So this is... I mean, this is Chuck with the fucking Mohawk. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2904.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, with the Mohawk. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2908.98s)]
*  I mean, look at this fucking savage, dude. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2909.3s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2911.3s)]
*  Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. Look at him. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2912.02s)]
*  Look at the pit bull. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2914.1000000000004s)]
*  They're not showing the... Look at this celebration. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2915.06s)]
*  Bro, I'm telling you, when Chuck Liddell was in his prime, he was one of the most terrifying [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2917.14s)]
*  fucking human beings that's ever walked the face of the earth. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2921.22s)]
*  Wow. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2923.7s)]
*  You can't do this for that long. There's only so many years a man can do this for like this. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2924.18s)]
*  But my God, Chuck Liddell was so fucking entertaining. He was a destroyer, man. He would [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2929.3799999999997s)]
*  just come at you. I mean, look at this shit. He's so terrifying looking. Tattoo on his head, [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2935.46s)]
*  Mohawk, built like a brick shit house, just throwing fucking hammers. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2939.94s)]
*  Who's the... Who's the... [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2943.7s)]
*  Who's the up and coming destroyer today? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2944.82s)]
*  Oh, did you see that Babalu knockout? Back that up again. This one was insane. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2946.5s)]
*  Oh, the leg? [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2955.38s)]
*  Dude, he would do that to everybody. He was just smashing people. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2957.94s)]
*  Wow. Yeah, he didn't know what defense is. He's pure offense all the time. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2960.82s)]
*  Well, he had defense, but he didn't... He fucking threw caution to the windman. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2965.46s)]
*  The guy just came after people and he was so mean. He was so mean. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2969.3s)]
*  The guy just came after people and he was so mean. But that also made the UFC because that guy [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2972.34s)]
*  being at... That was the figurehead. That was the big guy. He was the face of the company because [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2979.7000000000003s)]
*  he was the guy that like, if you, the casual fan, when you talk to him, like, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2984.5s)]
*  if you've seen the Chuck Liddell fight, you're going to see the Chuck Liddell fight. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2988.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2992.82s)]
*  So that like, that also took the sport to the next level. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2993.38s)]
*  So from throwing newspapers to stand up to pool to New York, then Hollywood, UFC interviews, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=2997.38s)]
*  what motivated you for podcasts? You were so far ahead of your time on that. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3006.82s)]
*  Well, I wasn't really. There was other people that were doing it at the same time. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3011.06s)]
*  Adam Crowell already had a podcast. Mark Maron already had a podcast. There was quite a few [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3014.5s)]
*  people that were doing it. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3018.1800000000003s)]
*  Maybe your style just stuck in group. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3018.98s)]
*  Well, it's just, I think I got into it because of radio, really. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3021.38s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3026.1800000000003s)]
*  Doing like Opie and Anthony show mostly. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3026.9s)]
*  Okay. So you did radio for a while then? [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3028.82s)]
*  Oh yeah, everybody did. And when you would do radio in the morning, like you, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3030.82s)]
*  the Opie and Anthony show in particular, you'd go there and you would hang out with comics. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3034.34s)]
*  So it was all just us shooting the shit, having a great time. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3038.7400000000002s)]
*  And when I would leave there, I'd go, God, that's so fun. I love doing that. I wish I could do that [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3041.86s)]
*  all the time. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3046.1s)]
*  Okay. All right. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3046.7400000000002s)]
*  And Anthony Kumia, who was Anthony from Opie and Anthony, he built a studio in his basement of his [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3047.86s)]
*  house in Long Island. And he used to do a show called Live From the Compound. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3054.82s)]
*  And he had like a green screen behind him. He played karaoke with a machine gun. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3059.3s)]
*  He was always hammered. It was hilarious, but he would just stream it on the internet. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3064.42s)]
*  And I was like, that looks like so much fun. Maybe I should start doing something like that. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3067.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3071.2200000000003s)]
*  And so then I went to Tom Green's house and Tom Green, he had this crazy setup. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3071.6200000000003s)]
*  I might've went to Tom Green's house before Anthony had his thing in the same time. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3076.34s)]
*  But Tom Green had like the Tom Green show that he was doing from his house. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3080.82s)]
*  So he was doing like a talk show and he set up his whole house like a television studio [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3084.8199999999997s)]
*  that's on the internet. So we had all these cables running to a server, excuse me, a server room. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3088.98s)]
*  And so I thought like, wow, maybe I should do something like that. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3094.8199999999997s)]
*  There's something to doing something on the internet. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3099.86s)]
*  Maybe a lot of people aren't going to see it, but it would be fun. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3102.66s)]
*  Yeah. Sounds like your motivator was for fun, not trying to grow some big audience or [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3105.62s)]
*  make a bunch of money, at least to start with. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3109.38s)]
*  Even like I do it the exact same way now as I've always done it. I just do it all myself [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3111.46s)]
*  in terms of like who I want to have on. I decide what day they're coming on and how to do it. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3116.58s)]
*  And I only talk to people that I'm interested in talking to. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3122.74s)]
*  I mean, the depth of what like you could have like your own Rogan encyclopedia books, [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3126.02s)]
*  all these people that come on that a lot of people never heard of and have all these interesting [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3129.7799999999997s)]
*  facts and opinions and I find it fascinating. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3134.42s)]
*  Learn some stuff. You definitely, I mean, you could talk to some. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3137.62s)]
*  I've had this like unexpected education where I get to talk to all these fascinating people [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3141.62s)]
*  and pick their brain. And you know, it's like you don't really get a chance to talk to people [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3145.86s)]
*  just like this. Just you and me looking at each other, eye to eye, no phones, no people around, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3150.58s)]
*  just for a conversation. That's it. That's all we're trying to do. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3155.06s)]
*  And to be able to do this like all the time, it's a real pleasure. It's very fortunate. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3158.2599999999998s)]
*  But it just seems like it's your own personal curiosity on different things that you like [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3165.86s)]
*  and or that you're interested in. Whereas it seems like you flip on TV, the people are getting [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3170.7400000000002s)]
*  interviewed. It's all part of some sort of a, it's all by design to some degree. You know, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3175.3s)]
*  you got the right PR firm, the right publicist. There's also with those things, the problem is, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3179.54s)]
*  you know, just like with Fear Factor, like you have to hire somebody, you have to hire a host. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3183.86s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3187.54s)]
*  You know, so if it's Fox News or if it's CNN, they have to hire hosts. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3188.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3192.26s)]
*  And sometimes those people are annoying, you know, and sometimes they're not annoying when [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3192.74s)]
*  you hire them and then become annoying as they get more popular and famous. And then you got to [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3196.4199999999996s)]
*  fire them. So like when you do this, you have to prep much, you get on the internet, you guys do [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3200.74s)]
*  a little bit of research for you or you just roll in and just start thinking and talking. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3204.8999999999996s)]
*  Well, I do have a guy, my friend, Matt Staggs, who does some research for me on some things. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3209.2999999999997s)]
*  He'll send me some briefings or some videos or some stuff I should watch. And then, you know, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3213.7799999999997s)]
*  with people that have books, I like to, especially if it's something like complicated, I like to [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3218.4199999999996s)]
*  listen to the book on audio. So I'll listen in the sauna, listen when I'm driving. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3222.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3226.2599999999998s)]
*  I'll get a sense of what they're doing. But, and then there's some subjects that I don't have, [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3226.58s)]
*  like with you, it's like, we're going to talk cars. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3231.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3233.2999999999997s)]
*  I just have, I'm just curious. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3233.46s)]
*  Well, it's just been very fascinating for me. I mean, we've known each other for a couple, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3235.2999999999997s)]
*  ever since you got to Texas two and a half years ago, something like that. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3238.74s)]
*  Just, you know, the more I get to know you, like- [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3243.06s)]
*  You ruined me with that fucking rap. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3244.8199999999997s)]
*  Well, yeah, that's what we do, right? Keep them coming back, right? [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3246.5s)]
*  That thing ruined me. I was like, this is crazy. What have you done? [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3250.42s)]
*  By the way, have you experienced the Raptor R yet? [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3254.98s)]
*  I have not. It looks amazing. I'm a Ford fan. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3257.86s)]
*  They're hard to get, they're expensive. We're working on a thousand horsepower [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3259.6200000000003s)]
*  package for Veloster Raptor 1000. So it would compete with the Mammoth. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3263.2200000000003s)]
*  Well, I might have to- [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3267.5400000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3268.9s)]
*  I'll keep you posted on that. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3269.2200000000003s)]
*  You know what I really miss about the Raptor? The visibility. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3270.5s)]
*  You can see out of the side mirror is way better. The TRX is rough. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3274.5s)]
*  The TRX is rough. The Ford's got the aluminum body and chassis. I mean, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3278.18s)]
*  I think both trucks were a hoot. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3281.8599999999997s)]
*  Oh, no, I love the TRX. It's just the visibility. That's the only issue I have with it. It's an [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3283.8599999999997s)]
*  amazing truck. I fucking love it. I love what Dodge did and I really love what you did too, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3288.66s)]
*  what Dodge did. The extra power- [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3294.02s)]
*  They gave us a good platform and- [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3296.5s)]
*  And the brake upgrade package that you put on it. It's a big difference. Big difference. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3298.02s)]
*  It's fucking magical. I love that thing. But the visibility from the Raptor was way better. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3302.66s)]
*  Yeah, I mean- [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3309.14s)]
*  The design with the F-150, where they have it. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3309.46s)]
*  There it is. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3311.3799999999997s)]
*  There it is. Look at that. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3311.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And so that's got the supercharged 5.2-liter V8 that's in the GT 500. And we [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3312.98s)]
*  should have our prototype up and running soon. I'll set it up here. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3319.3799999999997s)]
*  I like the name better too. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3321.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3323.06s)]
*  I have a problem with the name Mammoth. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3323.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3324.58s)]
*  I love the truck, but I got a problem. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3324.98s)]
*  Well, tell me. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3326.3399999999997s)]
*  Because it used to be a Tyrannosaurus Rex and it changed into a lesser animal. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3327.06s)]
*  Well, I guess, yeah, I guess the TRX could eat a- [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3331.7s)]
*  Yeah, it can't have that. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3333.54s)]
*  A wooly Mammoth. I never thought about that way. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3334.18s)]
*  Yeah. I wish we talked. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3336.58s)]
*  Guess what? Next time we're doing a branding exercise, you'll be the [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3338.7400000000002s)]
*  consultant that I could never afford to hire. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3344.26s)]
*  You can't. Well, I'll just do it for free. But you can't have a dinosaur. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3346.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3351.38s)]
*  Like the whole reason why it's a TRX is because it kills the Raptor. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3351.6200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3354.82s)]
*  Of little bitch-ass Velociraptors fucking with the Tyrannosaurus Rex, it's over. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3355.0600000000004s)]
*  So that's the whole idea. And then you turn it into something that people kill with sticks. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3358.98s)]
*  Yeah. So what? [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3362.7400000000002s)]
*  People wet them out with sticks. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3363.7s)]
*  Yeah, pretty much. That's funny. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3368.02s)]
*  And then probably the asteroid did it too. But yeah. So other than that, I love it. I told you [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3370.5s)]
*  I saw one in Vegas. It was orange. Like a matte orange. It was like, oh, that looks sick. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3375.54s)]
*  Ignition of orange, yeah. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3379.7s)]
*  I never thought I wanted to drive an orange car in my life until I saw that. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3380.8199999999997s)]
*  They're hard to get, but we can get them. They got yellow now too. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3384.2599999999998s)]
*  Do they have yellow? [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3386.74s)]
*  Yeah, called Rampage Yellow. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3387.62s)]
*  My friend Tony has a yellow CA Corvette. Tony Hinchcliffe? [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3389.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3392.5s)]
*  You saw Tony? [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3392.8199999999997s)]
*  He has one with yellow with black stripes. It's fucking awesome. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3394.18s)]
*  I was like, I never thought I'd like a yellow car. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3398.1s)]
*  Yeah. We actually just came out with a 700 horsepower supercharged package for the C8s. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3400.26s)]
*  We've only been working on it for almost three years, but just finished up a few months ago. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3403.94s)]
*  How much better is the handling on the Z06 with the wider body and the wider tires? [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3406.98s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, the Z06 is lighter. It's got aero, carbon brakes, carbon wheels are options. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3411.06s)]
*  Our chief development driver was with GM for 38 years. His name's John Heinroese. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3418.34s)]
*  We call him Heinroket. He's our chief engineer and development driver for the Venom F5. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3421.86s)]
*  He just got his new Z06, C8 Z06 with the Z07 package. You've got the cup tube, Michelin tires, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3426.6600000000003s)]
*  and the carbon splitter and rear wing. I just drove it on the road. I think if you took him to Kota, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3433.06s)]
*  both bone stock, I'm guessing your 10, 12 seconds of lap difference. Just massive. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3439.78s)]
*  Wow. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3445.7000000000003s)]
*  Now, if you drag race, of course, the Z06 is going to win by, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3446.1s)]
*  you know, the quarter mile would probably win by five or six car lengths. But the problem with [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3449.7799999999997s)]
*  the Z06 now is they've been having supply chain issues. I've got an early one on order, but [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3453.22s)]
*  I think the car's been out for nine months and there's less than 100 with the Z07 package on [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3459.46s)]
*  the road. So cool car. I hope to get mine and a lot of bang for the buck. I think that that would, [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3465.46s)]
*  I almost liken the new C8 Corvette almost in any form. Well, the Z06 to kind of like the 458 [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3472.1s)]
*  Ferrari is kind of where it was. Do you think it's possible to make a car like a Corvette with [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3477.62s)]
*  entirely American parts and American labor entirely? Look, American OEMs can do whatever [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3482.3399999999997s)]
*  they want to do. I think what Chevrolet's magic has been with the Corvette is to deliver that much [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3489.06s)]
*  value and that nice of a car in the volumes they do at the price point that they do. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3495.46s)]
*  It's crazy when you think about how much that car costs and the capability of it, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3499.54s)]
*  the bone stock stingray. Yeah, I mean, like I'm sure the Z06 is out now. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3503.7s)]
*  Likely the next iteration that comes from Chevy is the ZR1, probably 850 horsepower, twin turbo. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3509.86s)]
*  So it's like a twin turbo version of the 5.5 liter dual overhead cam motor in the current Z06. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3515.46s)]
*  That car's going to be 150, 170 grand. So that car will be as fast or faster than a McLaren or [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3520.74s)]
*  Ferrari that costs two or three times the money. So their trick is they know how to deliver great [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3526.5s)]
*  value. Now we've got a neat niche where we can build our own car from the ground up. It's all [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3531.22s)]
*  carbon fiber. It's all completely bespoke. It's American design and American build. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3536.8999999999996s)]
*  But that car is two to three million bucks a pop. GM are the masters of being able to scale it in [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3542.18s)]
*  masses so average people or somewhat average working folks can afford to buy them. Yeah, [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3547.4599999999996s)]
*  when you're in that car, you're like, what does this cost? This car's ridiculous. Well, [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3552.74s)]
*  the sticker on them, like my friend, Hein Rockets, I think he paid 160. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3556.26s)]
*  You try to find one on the street that you can buy. You mean the Z06? The Z06. I was talking about [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3562.1800000000003s)]
*  the Venom. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah. You get in that thing, you're like, how much does this cost? [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3567.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. But look, the Venom F5, what's cool about that is I'm 60. Maybe I'm around another [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3570.6600000000003s)]
*  25 years. Maybe I'm not. I don't know. But I think I would like to see, I'd like to have ultimately, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3577.38s)]
*  when we're all done with production, I'd love for each one of my five kids to have one if I'm [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3583.14s)]
*  able to do that. Anyway, I'd love to see our grandkids sell it at Barrett-Jackson or RM [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3586.42s)]
*  Auctions at some point down the road for four or five X. Maybe like a McLaren F1, [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3592.1s)]
*  like it'd be $20 million some day. I respect that you can drive that on the street. I respect that [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3597.2999999999997s)]
*  you can drive it. But you really should drive that only on a track. I mean, it's like when you're in [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3601.54s)]
*  it, you're like, yeah, this is kind of crazy. Yeah, we even like when we're driving, if you still have [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3606.5s)]
*  your Tesla Plaid, I drove mine up here. The performance of the things capable of, you should [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3610.34s)]
*  not use on the street. Sometimes there might be a place where you could go out and just have fun [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3616.1800000000003s)]
*  with yourself or your buddy. But yeah, same thing. I mean, the F5, go, forget about 0 to 60. 0 to 60 [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3621.1400000000003s)]
*  is a metric from 60 years ago. Let's talk about 0 to 200. It'll go to 0 to 200 miles an hour in 10 [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3629.06s)]
*  seconds. A hair under 10 seconds. It's as fast as, or maybe a tiny bit faster from 0 to 200 miles an [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3633.3s)]
*  hour as compared to a modern Formula One car. Jesus Christ. Yeah, power to weight ratio wise. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3639.94s)]
*  So, but it's built in America. You know, our guys just a hundred miles down the road build [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3644.02s)]
*  them from here. And I think they'll be very collectible someday. So we'll see. How many are [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3648.98s)]
*  you going to make? So we built 24 Venom F5 coupes. Those are all sold out. We're now producing the [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3653.8599999999997s)]
*  Roadster and the Revolution. The Roadster, open top, go out sunny day, have fun. The Revolution [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3660.8199999999997s)]
*  is more track focused. Now it's like our GT3RS. It's a track focused car, but it's still road legal, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3666.9s)]
*  has AC and all the comforts that you would have as Apple CarPlay. More track focused than that car? [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3672.42s)]
*  No, that is the track focused version. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no. If we, no. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3677.54s)]
*  Yeah. So we're doing 24 of those. So we're going to build all in about less than a hundred cars, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3683.2200000000003s)]
*  99 cars. I think right now we're, like I said, 36, 37 orders. And anyway, the cars- [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3688.58s)]
*  How long does it take you to build one of those? [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3695.46s)]
*  12 to 15 months. And is it, how much of it is carbon fiber? Like- [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3697.06s)]
*  100%. 100%. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3701.94s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, all the body work, all the chassis, all carbon. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3703.3s)]
*  Everything. Yeah. There's some aluminum and some steel [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3706.7400000000002s)]
*  substructure, but everything's carbon. Wow. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3709.78s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, there it is. That's the Roadster. That one, that particular, the blue car [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3712.34s)]
*  belongs to a guy named Dave Lineger. You want to talk about a wild man. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3717.78s)]
*  Let me see what the side image looks like, what it looks like with the Roadster. Wow. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3721.06s)]
*  That's pretty. Yeah. Lineger founded [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3725.2999999999997s)]
*  Remax Real Estate way back when. Anyway, that's his car. That's my head of design, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3727.22s)]
*  Nathan Malinick. But this is one of these deals to where if I knew today, or if I knew back then [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3731.22s)]
*  what I knew today, I don't know if I would have done it. Maybe I'm a little bit like you walking [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3737.4599999999996s)]
*  into the dojo. You ever see those gifts- How pretty that is. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3741.4599999999996s)]
*  You ever see the gifts where the guys have the telephone pole and their bus is sending [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3744.58s)]
*  the balls with it? I think that, and I didn't know what I was biting off when I went down this road, [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3747.62s)]
*  but when I started in 2013, it was just kind of an idea and a sketch. And then I got interested [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3753.22s)]
*  in it. And then we built the design model. Shell helped us build a design model. We unveiled it [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3758.02s)]
*  at Seaman Vegas in 2017. And then I had orders and I'm like, now I've got orders. I've got a design, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3762.18s)]
*  but I got to engineer this thing. Dude, that thing looks so good. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3766.98s)]
*  It's such a beautiful car. That Roadster one, that blue one. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3770.02s)]
*  Yeah. Oh my God, that's so beautiful. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3772.98s)]
*  Well, and the sound, what did you think of the sound when we're just out here ripping down the [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3774.4199999999996s)]
*  road? It's very rowdy. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3777.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it's very raw. So it's that 6.6 liter twin turbo V8, push rod V8. We've nicknamed the engine [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3778.98s)]
*  Fury. So ask me why we named the engine Fury. Why? [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3785.7s)]
*  No journalist has ever asked me this question in the automotive world. So we named it Fury because [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3789.22s)]
*  the car is designed to compete against the best from Europe. So Bugatti, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3795.78s)]
*  Aston Martin, Ferrari, Gordon Murray. And so one time we're developing the engine and I think we [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3802.82s)]
*  had, our target was 1600 horsepower. We managed to get a little over 1800. And I'm watching reruns [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3808.98s)]
*  on TV with my wife. My wife's asleep. It was a Brad Pitt movie, Fury. So it's those scrappy tank [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3814.5s)]
*  guys. They're over in Germany and their tanks all busted down. And then here comes two or three [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3820.5800000000004s)]
*  hundred Germans and they basically fought them to the death, like scrappy Americans that they were. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3826.5800000000004s)]
*  So I thought I'm going to name my engine Fury because it's designed to go over and [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3830.82s)]
*  beat the Germans. Scrappy American. We'll see. We haven't done it yet. We're working on it. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3836.9s)]
*  I love it. So is that a car that you could enter into races? Like would you consider racing? [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3842.42s)]
*  We've had customers ask us, would we be interested in building a dedicated race car? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3851.06s)]
*  And something we haven't made a decision on, but the answer I lean towards generally, [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3856.58s)]
*  you want to build a faster car? Well, hell yeah. If somebody wants to buy it, I'll build it. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3861.3s)]
*  But then the question becomes, we have to kind of go two directions. Do we want to just build [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3865.94s)]
*  a fun, like something taken the circuit of the Americas that our customer can do out and have [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3869.54s)]
*  fun with, or do you want to conform to race series? All of a sudden, if you're in race series, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3873.2200000000003s)]
*  if you're in Le Mans, something like a world endurance championship, you have to conform to [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3876.82s)]
*  all kinds of rules. I'm not a big rule guy. I'd rather just kind of build my car. Do I kick ass? [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3881.54s)]
*  I think there is probably some demand to have a dedicated track car where you've got a full road [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3886.34s)]
*  cage, all the safety equipment, the Halon fire extinguishing system, and everything else that [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3891.22s)]
*  you would expect. But right now, like I said, we're building, the coupes are sold out. We're [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3896.42s)]
*  completing the remaining run of those. Yeah, there's a revolution right there. Yeah, that [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3901.06s)]
*  belongs to a guy. We actually went to the same Jesuit high school back in the late 70s. He was [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3905.22s)]
*  a senior and I was a freshman. We never knew each other, but when he ordered the car, I found out [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3910.98s)]
*  he was from Kansas City and went to Rockhurst. He has his own private test track just outside [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3916.26s)]
*  of Kansas City. Yeah, you're just driving through the country and you see this fence with privacy. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3922.42s)]
*  On the other side of it, it's this gentleman's 3.4 mile private racetrack that we get to test at. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3927.86s)]
*  That's when you know you're really balling. He's balling pretty good. You get your own racetrack. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3933.06s)]
*  He's done all right. Olin gas guy and smart guy and been a really, really great client. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3936.58s)]
*  I used to think that when I would watch Top Gear and watch the Stig roll around the track, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3941.7s)]
*  I'm like, they have their own track. Yeah, so Top Gear tests on an old runway [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3946.5s)]
*  southwest of Lennon. It's called Dunsfold. They ran it so they have their own. I've been there [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3952.98s)]
*  before. I brought Steven Tyler over there like 10 years ago to be interviewed by Jeremy Clarkson and [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3958.8199999999997s)]
*  those guys. He was a client. We built a Venom GT for him. We're hanging out. I got to see him go [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3963.54s)]
*  out and do his little celebrity lap around the track. If you're ever over there and you want to [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3970.02s)]
*  do the star in the reasonably priced car, I'd connect you with those guys. They're great. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3973.7s)]
*  They're hilarious. Yeah, it's fun. Now you've got Chris Harris and you've got Clarkson and Hammon [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3978.2599999999998s)]
*  and May. They moved on to Amazon. Are they still doing it? Did they stop doing it on Amazon? [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3984.2599999999998s)]
*  I was in London a couple weeks ago and I saw Richard Hammon. What's the Amazon show called again? [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3989.7799999999997s)]
*  The Grand Tour. The Grand Tour. Clarkson's kind of a wild, bombastic guy. He started a show about [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=3994.9s)]
*  farming. He's got a farm out in the country. I think that's really kind of taken off. I think [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4002.98s)]
*  that's his new gig, but I think they still do a season a year. Good entertainment, good proper [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4006.98s)]
*  car stuff. He's a fun dude. What did he punch a producer? They pulled the show. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4014.9s)]
*  Well, I know a little bit about that. We had a Velociraptor truck that we were up in Canada [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4019.46s)]
*  with these guys. This has been back into 2014. I'm working with the producers and they're like, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4026.5s)]
*  when you're around the talent, don't talk to them. Don't spend time around them. I'm around famous [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4035.46s)]
*  people more than these guys. These guys are a lot more famous. I don't care that they're a big deal. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4041.3s)]
*  The producers kind of being a dick. We show up with these guys and then we provide the vehicle [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4047.1400000000003s)]
*  and they're going to go cross country through Canada and through the mountains and do all this [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4054.02s)]
*  crazy shit. Then they're going to go up on the mountain. They're going to rescue Richard Hammon, [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4056.98s)]
*  who's at the top of the mountain. He's got one of these Breitling watches where you pull out the [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4060.98s)]
*  little cord and it tells the satellite that you're stranded. It gives your coordinates to get rescued. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4063.86s)]
*  Anyway, now the producers are saying, well, you can't go up on the mountain while they're filming. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4068.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm like, okay, but listen to this. I'm going to go watch football. It's the playoffs. I'm going [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4075.1400000000003s)]
*  to go watch football and if something breaks and you need us to help you, we're not coming. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4078.98s)]
*  They're like, oh, then they change their tune. Okay, we'll come with this. Finally, it all turns [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4083.46s)]
*  out fine. Well, that producer, I won't say his name, but that producer that was being a massive [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4087.7000000000003s)]
*  dick and maybe he was just doing his job. Two weeks later, they're somewhere else in there in [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4092.7400000000002s)]
*  England and Jeremy gets a little bit of a temper and these guys work long hours and maybe they [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4097.3s)]
*  hadn't eaten and the producer guy was fucking with him and Jeremy fucking whacked the guy. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4102.5s)]
*  I wanted to fucking punch that guy a couple of times too, but I can't do that and I don't want [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4108.42s)]
*  to get arrested in Canada anyway. Yeah, so they canceled the show and it didn't Jeremy and him [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4113.06s)]
*  make up, but there was still... I'm sure that's all water under the bridge. Jeremy, Richard Hammon [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4118.74s)]
*  and James May were all very tight. I've spent time around them and then the other guy that's [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4126.5s)]
*  behind the scenes, but just so talented, his name is Andy Willman. He was the producer when [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4131.54s)]
*  they were on BBC. Now he's the producer, but when Steven Tyler was being interviewed, you like this [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4135.54s)]
*  from your comedy part of your brain, when Steven was being interviewed by Jeremy, I noticed that [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4140.9s)]
*  the interview went on for like twice as long as it probably should have and I get claustrophobic, [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4145.94s)]
*  so I don't like being in tight crowds, so I'm kind of hanging towards the back of the crowd [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4151.06s)]
*  that they're filming all this live and then they aired it later, but they're filming in front of [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4154.82s)]
*  a live audience and here this guy that looks like he's a homeless dude wearing a t-shirt, [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4158.66s)]
*  looked like he hadn't showered in about a week, he's standing there making notes and I realized [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4164.179999999999s)]
*  I was Andy Willman, the producer of the show and so what Jeremy's doing, he's telling all these [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4169.3s)]
*  jokes and asking these questions and Andy is using the live audience as his focus group. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4173.54s)]
*  Oh, they laughed at this. Oh, I don't think this is as funny and that's how they edit it before [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4178.58s)]
*  it gets transmitted to the rest of the UK and the world. Interesting. I thought that is so clever, [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4183.06s)]
*  that is so smart. And I don't know if that's comedians or entertainers, but you would think [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4188.1s)]
*  to some degree you want to improve your crap, but he's got a quick turnaround time, so he's [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4193.700000000001s)]
*  got another show he's got to do the following week, so he's just like Jeremy's doing all this stuff [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4197.860000000001s)]
*  and sometimes they laugh and sometimes they wouldn't, but this guy was definitely paying [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4201.780000000001s)]
*  attention. That show, Top Gear, did Tesla dirty. Yeah, they did. Oh, they did. They did all kinds [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4204.740000000001s)]
*  of crooked shit. But they did Tesla dirty. They pretended the car ran out of batteries. Oh yeah. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4210.98s)]
*  The car didn't, so they had like they're pushing the car and I think they had a lawsuit about that, [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4215.7s)]
*  correct? They probably did, but that goes back to like we were talking about earlier. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4222.339999999999s)]
*  Quite a bit earlier, Jamie. It just seems like- [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4225.139999999999s)]
*  That was dirty. It seems like everybody has an agenda, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4227.139999999999s)]
*  so what was the agenda behind that? Was that just the- [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4229.139999999999s)]
*  Well, they wanted to create an entertaining storyline. They do. They'll throw your ass [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4231.86s)]
*  under the bus and a heartbeat. That was what it is. Oh, Tesla attempted to sue the BBC for [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4236.98s)]
*  libel in March of 2011. The courts ruled in favor of the BBC saying that no viewer of the show would [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4241.54s)]
*  be likely to reasonably compare the Roadster's performance on the show with its performance in [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4246.9s)]
*  the real world. That doesn't make any sense. Yeah, no. They got railroaded. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4251.78s)]
*  Well, British court sides with British corporation that's owned by the British [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4254.9s)]
*  government against American company. Oops. Yeah, they got railroaded. Because the idea [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4258.98s)]
*  that watching this thing break down wouldn't influence you to not get one. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4263.06s)]
*  These people are testing it and it breaks down. Look, those guys, good or bad- [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4267.46s)]
*  We should just say what happened while we're saying it. Because their car didn't really break [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4271.620000000001s)]
*  down. They faked it. No, they faked it. They faked it. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4275.22s)]
*  They did it just to sort of make a point about what could happen with electric cars, [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4278.02s)]
*  but it's a fake point. It was a manufactured deal. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4282.900000000001s)]
*  To your point, but they just want eyeballs. So the more controversial, [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4285.38s)]
*  one time when Jeremy was driving this truck and they were like, what would happen if we ran into [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4294.740000000001s)]
*  a brick wall? He ended up going to the hospital and getting broken ribs and whatever else. Just [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4298.02s)]
*  show you the video of this guy. So they'll do anything. They weren't- [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4303.54s)]
*  Who ran into a brick wall? Jeremy Clarkson. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4306.5s)]
*  He did? With a truck? Yeah, it's on YouTube. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4308.42s)]
*  And he went to the hospital? Yeah, they got a video camera. They got a GoPro inside. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4310.34s)]
*  And he, it does, I mean- He went to the hospital? [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4314.26s)]
*  Yeah, he went to the hospital from that. Why would you do that? [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4317.22s)]
*  They did. And they- How did he die? [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4319.54s)]
*  Because of retention, dude. These guys were the masters of jumping the shark season after [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4321.700000000001s)]
*  season after season. You heard about the deal when they went to Argentina? [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4327.3s)]
*  What deal? Well, let me see the- Let's go one step at a time. Let me see the truck [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4331.06s)]
*  slamming into the wall before we get to Argentina. Because I just can't believe that they would just [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4334.34s)]
*  drive- Clarkson, top gear, crash. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4338.9800000000005s)]
*  Full acceleration? Truck crash. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4340.900000000001s)]
*  No, each guy had to do it and they're all wearing their safety equipment. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4343.06s)]
*  It might've been 20 miles an hour. I mean, just run as fast as you can into that [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4346.9800000000005s)]
*  wood wall over there and it's gonna fucking hurt. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4351.62s)]
*  Yeah, I think you could, legitimately, you could die. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4355.46s)]
*  Oh yeah. Oh, it's one of these trucks? [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4358.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Oh boy. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4360.5s)]
*  Yeah, look at this. He's going pretty good. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4361.9400000000005s)]
*  Bro, he's going very fast. That is so crazy. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4365.54s)]
*  So do you think these guys give a fuck about hurting Elon and his company just to try- [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4369.54s)]
*  That is so crazy. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4373.46s)]
*  They want views. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4374.1s)]
*  Oh my God, bro. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4377.14s)]
*  I mean, oh shit. He's lucky he has teeth. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4378.18s)]
*  He's lucky he has a neck. His neck's gotta be fucked up from that. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4381.62s)]
*  Yeah, we did a thing with them at Grand Tour in Detroit about five years ago and [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4385.3s)]
*  maybe he's got a good chiropractor. It looks like he's healed up, but man, that's pretty gnarly. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4390.26s)]
*  That seems like it could cause permanent damage. And so they would do stuff like that. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4394.74s)]
*  Well, and that even happened recently. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4397.46s)]
*  Caused slip discs, worst injury he suffered on the show. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4399.54s)]
*  And another one of their guys in the current crew, I forget his name, maybe Pato O'Rourke, [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4402.0199999999995s)]
*  but anyway, he had a bad car crash that canceled the whole season. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4406.66s)]
*  Really? That bad? [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4411.3s)]
*  Yeah, and again, nobody really knows the details. They're not showing anything, but [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4412.82s)]
*  I hear it was pretty painful. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4416.179999999999s)]
*  When you watch that image, he reaches for his neck immediately and you see how his head [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4419.219999999999s)]
*  violently snaps. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4424.02s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know how it doesn't break your neck. So just stuff like that. When we were in Canada [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4424.900000000001s)]
*  with the crew, we were hanging out with the crew. So they went down to Canada, they went to Argentina, [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4431.38s)]
*  excuse me. The gummy bears kicking in, I suppose. They're in Argentina and so one of the cars they [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4437.46s)]
*  rode on the car, they're doing this cross country thing. They're kind of poking fun at the Argentinians [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4443.540000000001s)]
*  when they lost the Falcon War back in the 80s to the Brits. And the story was that these guys [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4448.42s)]
*  were getting chased out of the country like people were looking for them. If they found them, they [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4454.66s)]
*  were going to freaking beat their ass pretty hard or worse. And so I'm talking to the crew [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4458.9s)]
*  and the presenters were able to get to Buenos Aires and were able to get out of the country, [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4465.54s)]
*  but the crew was still there. And people are like, they're calling the embassy, they're like, [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4472.34s)]
*  hey, what can we do? The fucking locals are trying to get us. And so I guess the present, [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4476.42s)]
*  again, this is from hearing from the crew when we were in Canada with our Velociraptor, is that [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4482.66s)]
*  the presenters got out, the crew were stuck fearing for their lives, like hiding out in [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4490.1s)]
*  places trying to make it to the airport to get home. And then so when the whole shit hit the fan, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4495.14s)]
*  the presenters in England felt bad for them. So they bought them all first class tickets [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4501.9400000000005s)]
*  or business class from Argentina back to the UK. But then the question becomes kind of given [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4505.38s)]
*  the pattern of wanting to further jump the shark. And look, if I climb a mountain, I want to climb [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4512.1s)]
*  the next mountain so I get that to some degree. But did these guys actually try to stir up the [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4517.62s)]
*  locals by putting shit on their car to fuck with them? Well, yeah, just for notoriety. And so, [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4523.38s)]
*  I mean, I would think so. 100%. Why else would you do it? Because you're trying to be nice? [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4529.78s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know if they knew it was going to go as far, but it's kind of a shitty deal where [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4535.62s)]
*  they skated out there and their crew is literally afraid they were going to get fucking beat to [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4540.099999999999s)]
*  death. Imagine if they did. Yeah. And I'm hearing this from the crew in this auto going down like [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4545.3s)]
*  30 days before. Yeah, it's kind of interesting. Well, it's a wild show, but it's a fun show. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4552.099999999999s)]
*  It's a fun show. They're irreverent and they fuck with everybody. And yeah, have they gone too far [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4558.82s)]
*  a few times? Sure. But I think they're just trying to entertain. Well, he does entertain. And when [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4563.54s)]
*  Jeremy Clarkson reviews cars, it's like when he's really enthusiastic about it, like he's reviews [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4569.86s)]
*  Ferraris. That guy's word was like, it would either make you or break you. And that was probably from [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4574.5s)]
*  05 to 20. Ferro hit about a 10 year period. Now you've got Chris Harris, who's friends with our [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4582.259999999999s)]
*  mutual friend, Matt Ferra in California. Yeah, I've had Chris on a podcast before. He's great. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4587.46s)]
*  Yeah. He's probably one of my favorites. We had dinner with him in London a couple weeks ago and [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4592.26s)]
*  just could be any finer. Yeah. Him and Matt are two of my favorites for reviewing cars. Smoky tires [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4596.5s)]
*  are awesome. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just car entertainment has sort of come a long way. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4602.18s)]
*  There wasn't really that much back in the day. I mean, there was not really a show like once Top [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4609.46s)]
*  Gear came around, then people realize how entertaining it is just to like see cars and [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4615.78s)]
*  hang out with cars. Yeah, right. Now, I think really one of the best of it is Jay Leno. Like [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4620.0199999999995s)]
*  Jay Leno's garage is fantastic. It is great. It's very good. Yeah. He loves cars so much that it's [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4624.82s)]
*  like it's so contagious. I don't know anybody that knows more about cars from A to Z, from steam cars [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4629.54s)]
*  to hyper cars to race cars, everything in between. Jay Leno was literally a walking automotive [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4634.82s)]
*  encyclopedia. Yeah, I don't understand the steam cars. Like, go out there with that. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4640.74s)]
*  Well, yeah. He's got ones that he drives around that aren't even supposed to have rubber tires, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4644.5s)]
*  so he had to put rubber on these steel wheels so that it's legal to drive around. Well, did he [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4650.66s)]
*  ever tell you on a steam car, you're heating up this boiler and the boiler's got water in it and [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4654.98s)]
*  that turns into steam and that's what makes it go. But when you run low on water, if you're not [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4660.42s)]
*  careful, it will explode. So you have to turn off the heat. This came up because I was in Jay's [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4665.46s)]
*  one time and I saw one of his steam cars and he's talking about it. I'm like, what's the garden hose [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4672.9s)]
*  in the back seat for? He's like, well, I'm over at driving through Burbank and his start running out [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4676.34s)]
*  of water, so he's able to shut it down so the engine doesn't explode. And he goes up and knocks [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4682.66s)]
*  on some little old lady's front door and says, ma'am, can I hook my hose up to your spigot? I [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4687.38s)]
*  put some water in my steam car. Imagine Jay Leno showing up at your house wanting to borrow water. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4694.18s)]
*  He's got an insane collection. I can't even believe how big it is. When I was there, [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4704.18s)]
*  I thought it was just one of these buildings. It's the whole block. He has 11 buildings. They're [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4708.18s)]
*  all kind of daisy chained together. It's incredible. And motorcycles too. Jay's been a customer, [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4713.700000000001s)]
*  gosh, almost 30 years. He had the first black Gen 1 Viper and so he wanted to do an exhaust, [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4720.58s)]
*  an intake, and a 373 rear end gear. And so we're scheduled to go out there. And I just talked to [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4728.34s)]
*  him on the phone one time and I only dealt with him. I didn't deal with any assistants or handlers. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4735.62s)]
*  So I just dealt with him on the phone the one time. And then my wife had our first shot, [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4740.74s)]
*  we had a miscarriage and so I couldn't go. So I just had somebody call out there to his office [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4746.58s)]
*  say, John can't make it. Didn't give me any reason. And dude, like two days later, [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4750.18s)]
*  flowers and a card showed up to our house. And to this day, I do not know how Jay knew that [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4754.66s)]
*  we had a miscarriage or even knew my home address, but somehow he found out and sent flowers. We've [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4760.5s)]
*  been friends ever since. That's awesome. Yeah. That's very nice. Special dude for sure. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4765.0599999999995s)]
*  Super passionate, super influential. You know, another thing I learned from Jay that's cool, [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4768.74s)]
*  so whether it's a 2.7 min old Venom and Fiber Revolution or one of our Velociraptor Mammoth trucks, [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4772.1s)]
*  whenever I'm out in public with one of our vehicles or if I'm at like a Cars and Copy Cars show, [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4778.900000000001s)]
*  Jay taught me that. I said, what got you into cars, Jay? He said, well, when he was 12 years old, [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4783.9400000000005s)]
*  there was like maybe a 55 Jag parked out in front of a store and he was admiring it. And the guy [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4789.54s)]
*  came up to the car and says, Hey kid, you like the car? And he says, yeah. And the owner said, [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4794.42s)]
*  would you like to sit in it? And so I've seen Jay at a bunch of car shows. So if you're somewhere [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4799.14s)]
*  south of 12 years old and you ask him nicely, he'll let you sit in his car. So we do the same thing. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4804.02s)]
*  And so when they kind of start queuing up and I get the 14 year old, I'm like, no, no, no. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4811.06s)]
*  He goes to those Cars and Coffees. Oh yeah. He takes all kinds of shit. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4814.900000000001s)]
*  So when Jay was doing Tonight Show, that's when I met him and we did several projects for him. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4818.900000000001s)]
*  He'd come out to the show, but he was always so busy. I would just see him in passing and he's so [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4825.06s)]
*  high functioning ADHD dyslexic, which my son Cole is too. His brain just moves in a million miles [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4832.02s)]
*  a minute. So I'd see him, Hey Jay, how you doing? Blah, blah, blah. In and out, in and out, [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4838.9800000000005s)]
*  get in his next car and go. But then when he retired from the Tonight Show, a whole different [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4842.26s)]
*  Jay. Just like you could have a conversation with him. He wasn't thinking about all the shit he had [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4847.3s)]
*  to do. And he's so much better at that show because it's so much what he's actually interested in [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4852.1s)]
*  instead of just the job of hosting the Tonight Show. And the mistake that I made growing up is [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4858.42s)]
*  like, he would do comedy on the Tonight Show. We always thought it was funny. We would watch it. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4863.38s)]
*  But then years later, maybe 10 years ago, I got to hear him do stand up and I'm like, it's so much [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4869.780000000001s)]
*  more edgy. My wife will only handle so much. If you get into a certain level of crude, [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4876.34s)]
*  she won't go. So I have to go by myself. So he's right there on the edge of certain ones. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4882.26s)]
*  Jay Lano's on the edge? Really? Oh dude, I thought so. So Shell had a big launch for a new oil [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4886.5s)]
*  product about 10 years ago when we were there. And he's like a fucking machine gun, dude. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4892.9800000000005s)]
*  You get about, so in that 45 minute set, you get at least an hour and a half worth of material. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4898.5s)]
*  It is just coming fucking rapid fire. That's interesting. I gotta go see him live then [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4903.86s)]
*  because I haven't seen him live in a long time. I don't know where he's working out or if he just [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4908.259999999999s)]
*  does big shows. I don't know. He used to do Comedy Magic Club every Sunday. I see his stuff pops up [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4917.219999999999s)]
*  on my social media feeds like when he's around in the area. So he does shows. But to your point, [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4923.299999999999s)]
*  reach out to him. I'll give you his number and reach out to him and have him come do the mothership. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4931.22s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. He used to be really respected as like an edgy comic when he first started. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4935.780000000001s)]
*  In the 1970s, when he would do, I guess it was the early 80s or late 70s, he would do Letterman. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4942.74s)]
*  I used to watch him on Letterman. He'd wear a black leather jacket. What years was that? [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4948.820000000001s)]
*  This would have been probably mid 80s, 84, 85. And they used to do a little gag called, [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4952.34s)]
*  Jay, what's your beef? What's my beef? Kind of a grumpy old man program. But yeah, I always [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4957.86s)]
*  thought Jay was pretty good. I love Carson when Carson was on back in the day too. So [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4964.9s)]
*  you just kind of go from one to the next. But I'm like, some of the current stuff, [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4969.94s)]
*  you got Gutfeld who's finding funny as shit, but the other guys are just- [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4974.5s)]
*  It's a hard gig, man, because there's so many restrictions. First of all, you're talking to [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4977.7s)]
*  someone very quickly. If you're going to talk to them about something complex, [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4983.54s)]
*  something that's difficult to grasp- That's why the Pull-In Form podcast works, right? [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4988.82s)]
*  100%. Because if you're just talking to someone and you're talking to them for five minutes, [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4992.34s)]
*  and then you go into commercial, it's like you can only get so into the subject. And some subjects [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=4996.58s)]
*  deserve more attention. They deserve time. And you really can't do it on those shows. And then also [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5002.18s)]
*  you're censored, right? So you can't say certain words. You can't speak your mind. You'll have a [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5007.14s)]
*  producer in your ear telling you what to do. And then on top of that, you have these commercials. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5012.02s)]
*  You have to wait for the commercial. Then you got to build momentum back up when you're back. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5016.9800000000005s)]
*  All right, we're back. Why are we back? What is this? It's the worst way to have conversations. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5020.26s)]
*  And that's essentially what those things are. What those things are is just, it's short attention [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5026.1s)]
*  span, quick soundbite conversations that are not satisfying. That's the problem. To get a satisfying [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5032.26s)]
*  conversation, you need to talk to someone for a long time. And so they're crippled. It's like [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5038.42s)]
*  they're handicapped by the system that they exist in. There's nothing you can do to fix it. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5043.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't know, man, but was it that much different from when Carson and Lena were doing it? [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5049.78s)]
*  Yes, because today's a lot worse. Well, there's podcasts now. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5055.38s)]
*  Oh, so they have competitions. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5057.9400000000005s)]
*  No. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5059.62s)]
*  There was nothing else to watch back then. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5059.86s)]
*  Now people see it. This is what it is. It's like they see the difference. Because if all, [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5062.1s)]
*  the only conversations you see with people having on television are on things like The Tonight Show, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5066.58s)]
*  then that seems normal. But as soon as you can have long form, full, uncensored conversations. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5072.1s)]
*  Deep dive, unpack it all. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5077.86s)]
*  Yeah. That's when it becomes awkward because then you're like, why are they doing it like this? [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5079.14s)]
*  This is an uncomfortable way to watch people talk. And also someone's sitting there and you're [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5084.74s)]
*  sitting next to them in this weird way and you're facing a crowd. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5090.66s)]
*  You've got a live audience. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5093.14s)]
*  It's all weird. There's so much weirdness to it. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5094.740000000001s)]
*  That's funny. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5096.9800000000005s)]
*  It's just not a good way to have a good conversation. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5097.700000000001s)]
*  All it was really was an advertisement for whatever the fuck that person was selling. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5101.780000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5106.34s)]
*  So if the person had a sitcom, a new record. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5106.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. New movie. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5109.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. That's really what it is. And Jay Leno didn't get a chance to pick the guests. He wasn't up to him. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5110.900000000001s)]
*  Well, he did tell me, we worked with him on a project a couple of years ago where [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5120.34s)]
*  we're just sitting in a truck bullshitting. And I kind of asked him, I said, so since you [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5124.26s)]
*  don't do the Tonight Show, do you miss any of that at all? He's like, no, not really. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5128.9800000000005s)]
*  He's like, I wasn't really big on going to movies. So if somebody's coming on the show, [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5132.900000000001s)]
*  I'd go watch the movie just so I knew what to talk about. He's like, I'm really not into celebrities [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5137.620000000001s)]
*  and I don't go to the movies that much. I do my car thing. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5141.38s)]
*  Well, for Jay Leno and for all those comedians that lived back then, the Tonight Show was the [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5144.660000000001s)]
*  Holy Grail. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5151.06s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5151.700000000001s)]
*  It was to be the host of the Tonight Show, the host of the Letterman Show, the host of [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5152.34s)]
*  some late night show. That was the Holy Grail. So they all wanted that. And so when you get it [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5157.9400000000005s)]
*  and you realize, is this really what I wanted? It was a thing that seemed like no one could get. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5164.34s)]
*  And back then, if you got it, it was a big deal. If you were the host of the Tonight Show, it was [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5171.38s)]
*  a big deal. And nowadays, it's just another show. It's just another thing that's on television. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5174.82s)]
*  They got to compete with you. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5180.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, they're not even competing. It's like they're competing with Netflix, really. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5182.34s)]
*  They're competing with things. But for conversations, yeah, they're competing. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5186.26s)]
*  Well, Bill Maher has a podcast now. There's a lot of great podcasters. If you want just [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5189.9400000000005s)]
*  free entertainment in your ears, there's so much. There's so many different crime shows [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5194.9800000000005s)]
*  and so many different stand up comedians have podcasts and so many scientists. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5201.62s)]
*  And fuck, man. I mean, you can just be entertained forever. So breaking into that is hard. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5205.860000000001s)]
*  And when you're on a television show, you're kind of depending upon people flipping through [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5211.3s)]
*  the channels or people that are accustomed to watching it at 11 p.m. Let's turn on the [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5215.46s)]
*  late night show. It's kind of a trap, though. It's a trap. They don't grow. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5220.58s)]
*  The viewership of those things just keeps dwindling. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5229.86s)]
*  So where do the young comedians, where do they... So you didn't get your big break by going on [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5232.58s)]
*  Lennon or going on Carson or something like that. But you found the right manager. It's like for a [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5238.66s)]
*  young comedian that's trying to get going, how do they get discovered today? [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5244.66s)]
*  Oh, YouTube. YouTube, Internet, social media. Someone could be funny and have one clip about [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5248.5s)]
*  one subject that resonates with people and they throw it up on their Instagram and it gets reposted [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5255.22s)]
*  and shared. They put it up on Twitter, it's on YouTube, and then bam, all of a sudden they're [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5259.0599999999995s)]
*  famous. It happens all the time now. This is a great time for people to get their stuff out there, [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5263.06s)]
*  probably the greatest time ever. So if you've got talent, you can't keep it down. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5269.14s)]
*  At least people know about it. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5274.5s)]
*  There's definitely some people that get better breaks than other people. That definitely happens. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5276.9800000000005s)]
*  But at the end of the day, really it's about becoming undeniable. And if you can just put [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5280.42s)]
*  your stuff out there and enough people love it. So that's where they get their big break today. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5284.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, back in my day, I got on the MTV half hour comedy hour. That was the first television show [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5289.3s)]
*  that I did where I got attention from it and then I got a development deal. So that was the pathway [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5296.5s)]
*  back then. It was like you would do a stand-up comedy TV show and then you'd try to get a sitcom. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5301.3s)]
*  Everybody just wanted a sitcom or they wanted to host the Tonight Show or host the Jimmy Kimmel [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5306.58s)]
*  show or whatever. Get your own show. But there wasn't a lot of those. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5311.139999999999s)]
*  Did you ever do it? I mean, you did Fairfactor. But did you ever host a show where you're [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5313.94s)]
*  interviewing people? I did. I guest hosted once later with Greg Kinnear. He was out of town. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5318.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And I guest hosted it. It was fun. I enjoyed it. But it's still very limited. It's just not [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5323.78s)]
*  the same thing. It's like doing this is the perfect version of conversations for me. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5330.58s)]
*  Some people like it more restricted and they want to be wearing a suit. They want the lights [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5337.46s)]
*  and they want the crowd. They feel like it's more of a show. Sure. I get it. There's all kinds of [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5342.42s)]
*  different things that people like. But for me, this is the most fun way to do it. How's a gummy [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5347.38s)]
*  bear treating you? I'm buzzing pretty good. You look a little faded, doesn't he? I can smell it. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5352.18s)]
*  I can smell you went to the dark lands. I brought my son. He can drive me home. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5359.22s)]
*  No autopilot for me tonight. Yeah. None of that. That's funny. That's Ric Flair. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5363.14s)]
*  Woo. Woo. Woo-choos. Texas has got to get its shit together with weed. It's weird that some weed [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5367.06s)]
*  is legal. I think it will. That weed is legal. Like Delta 9 is legal. I've got a quick weed story [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5374.02s)]
*  for you. This ties into Cold Plunge. So I got diagnosed as ADHD back in the late 90s. I'd been [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5380.740000000001s)]
*  married for a while and we're having trouble. My counselor gives me this book and says, [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5389.06s)]
*  answer these hundred questions and if you're more than 80 of them, then you're ADHD. I was 98 out [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5393.78s)]
*  of 100. So I started taking Ritalin. Okay. And I've been taking Ritalin for almost 25 years. So fast [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5398.0199999999995s)]
*  forward to a couple months ago, I go to my doctor, to the clinic to go get my prescription refill [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5406.179999999999s)]
*  because it's a controlled substance like Adderall or opioids or whatever else. And look, for me, [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5412.58s)]
*  it just wakes me up in the morning. I don't drink coffee and it kind of helps me stay focused on [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5418.179999999999s)]
*  the stuff I've got to do and better follow through and focus. And so I go in and the nurse says, [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5422.42s)]
*  well, we have a new policy at the clinic in order to get a refill for Ritalin or any other controlled [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5428.02s)]
*  substance. We have to drug test you. And I said, okay, all right, whatever. Once a year. And so I [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5432.34s)]
*  started filling out some paperwork. I'm like, she's like, okay, well, tell me now when you want to go [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5439.06s)]
*  pee in the cup. And I said, you got a drug test for me now? I said, I'm 60 years old. I've never [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5442.1s)]
*  been drug tested in my life. And it just pissed me off. I'm like, I'm paying money to be here. I just [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5447.14s)]
*  want my Ritalin. So I stopped taking it. And so like for 30 days, I'm kind of like, oh man, [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5451.62s)]
*  I got a little less energy, a little less focus. Well, then I've been watching you and other friends [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5456.66s)]
*  cold plunging. Are you allowed to just get off a Ritalin like that? You're not supposed to cold [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5461.3s)]
*  turkey it, but I did. It was on a fairly low dose. Yeah. It was 20 milligrams in the morning, 10 in [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5467.38s)]
*  the afternoon, but it only didn't take the afternoon. But here's what I found that for the, [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5471.94s)]
*  for the 30 days following, it wasn't that hard of a real transition. I was just a little more [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5475.78s)]
*  lethargic and needed to get to the gym more. But what I learned was, is that my level of aggression [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5480.1s)]
*  with my kids, my wife, my employees was ratcheted down by probably 20%. From the cold? Well, [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5486.5s)]
*  so this means stop taking Ritalin. Okay. And my resting heart rate was lower. And so I thought, [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5495.14s)]
*  what can I do? So, so I, so Ritalin was just jacking you up. It was jacking me up, but it had been [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5500.660000000001s)]
*  jacking me up for 25 years. And then friction, I would have it with employees or I would want to, [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5504.900000000001s)]
*  get into tussles on just stupid shit. And so this recent revelation is, is the clinic wanting to drug [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5510.0199999999995s)]
*  test me so I could get my Ritalin refill. Me not taking the Ritalin, I believe, my wife and kids [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5516.34s)]
*  at least tell me this, a few employees, that I'm, that I'm just, I don't have to take gummy [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5522.34s)]
*  bears to calm down at times, right? I'll take a gummy bear sometimes to go to sleep. But then I [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5528.34s)]
*  thought, okay, well, what can help kind of replace, kind of give me that kick in the ass in the morning? [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5532.82s)]
*  So kind of wake me up and get me going and I'll go, I'll go do an early workout, a boxing workout a [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5537.3s)]
*  couple of times a week. But I'm like, I need something else. I've been seeing you and other [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5542.1s)]
*  people doing the cold plunge program. And that's like, and I had done it a few times before I got [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5545.38s)]
*  off the Ritalin, but I thought like, okay, the last time I did that, that like gave me like this [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5550.820000000001s)]
*  boost of focus, like this mental focus and more calm through the day. So I bought a, so I bought a [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5555.22s)]
*  cold plunge tank and I got it about three weeks ago and cold plunge, maybe five days a week in the [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5560.5s)]
*  morning. And I don't know, maybe it's just because it's a combination of, it's something that I really [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5566.58s)]
*  don't want to do and it's really hard to do. When I say that to myself, I'm like, that's the very [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5571.38s)]
*  reason I need to go do it. And then secondarily, just like it shocks my system and all of a sudden [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5574.34s)]
*  it just wakes me up. So I'm like, you know, so if you're listening out there and you're on Ritalin, [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5578.9s)]
*  your kids on Ritalin, you know, maybe what's, I'm not a doctor, I'm not telling you what to do, but [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5583.46s)]
*  I am saying that I got off of Ritalin and now I can kind of backfill that boost energy in the morning [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5587.94s)]
*  by doing a cold plunge. That's interesting that you were on it for 25 years and you're able to get [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5592.9s)]
*  off of it in 30 days. What did that transition feel like? Because I would imagine that you'd [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5597.94s)]
*  kind of become dependent on the feeling that you get. I never, so I would run out from time to time. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5603.46s)]
*  I would never, I never felt dependent on it, but I did feel lower energy. Especially the last, [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5608.179999999999s)]
*  probably the last 10 years as I've gotten older, I'm like, okay, you know, I've never really been a [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5614.66s)]
*  morning person. I used to like up till maybe 10 years ago, I wouldn't go to bed till two or three [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5618.66s)]
*  in the morning and then I'd wake up at, you know, seven or eight the next day. But anyway, so Ritalin [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5623.139999999999s)]
*  just kind of gets me going, helps me focus, stay on task, but it probably starts wearing off kind of [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5628.0199999999995s)]
*  by mid-afternoon, but I just didn't. The thing about that kind of stuff to me is if you can [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5633.78s)]
*  function as good as you're functioning without it, I wonder, because we think of medications as being [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5638.98s)]
*  necessary. We think of things like that as being necessary, like this is what you need, it'll [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5644.0199999999995s)]
*  straighten you out. Is it, you know, I mean, is what we're missing, like at least with some people, [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5647.86s)]
*  is what they're missing, physical activity and stressors, things like cold and heat, [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5654.259999999999s)]
*  and things like a morning workout. Like how many people are just going to a pill and not doing [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5658.98s)]
*  those other things to see if like maybe there's a more healthy way to approach this? Yeah, I mean, [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5665.62s)]
*  just how much time do I waste just glancing at my phone? Who texted me? What's on the news? What [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5670.5s)]
*  about pull cues? Whatever, you know? And so one of the things I noticed when we first installed it, [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5676.74s)]
*  maybe it was the first or second time that I cold plunged at home, like I was kind of had this euphoria. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5681.86s)]
*  I don't know if it's kind of a little bit of a dump of endorphins or dopamine or what, [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5688.9s)]
*  but just kind of me being happy. I didn't one time wonder where's my phone, what's going on? [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5692.9s)]
*  And my counselor tells me that just by looking at our phone, sometimes that gives us a tiny little [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5697.7s)]
*  dopamine hit. Yeah, it does. Look at the phone. It's also just an addiction. You just look at [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5701.7s)]
*  for new information constantly. You're always looking for some new picture or new video, [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5706.5s)]
*  new thing to like stimulate you. So that's why I found the cold plunge kind of just for a period [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5710.9s)]
*  of time. I'm like, it's like, I was just, it was calm. It was like Zen. It's like me being up in [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5716.34s)]
*  the mountains, looking at the trees and just kind of being a peaceful moment without having to, [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5720.98s)]
*  you know, take a Ric Fleur gummy bear. What definitely makes you so happy when you get out [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5725.46s)]
*  of it. Yeah. And you get out of it like, whoo. I'm happy just because I'm not freezing my balls [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5728.66s)]
*  off anymore. Yeah, it's that, but it's really just the rush of endorphins. You feel so happy. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5732.42s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. And our whole, our family's doing it. My wife did it. My daughter comes over [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5737.46s)]
*  and does it. Son's real athletic. He's got two scoped knees. And so he thought he tweaked his knee [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5741.7s)]
*  playing pickleball the other day and he did it and said no more pain. So I mean, you as an athlete, [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5747.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean, and still probably training pretty hard. Do you find like when your body's getting a little [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5752.42s)]
*  worn or your joints a little sore, does that, does the cold plunge help you too? I do it every day. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5755.9400000000005s)]
*  So I don't know. Okay. I mean, I still have joint pain. I still have like some stuff, but that's [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5759.54s)]
*  just what comes into the territory. Okay. Yeah, it is what it is. You just get accustomed to being in [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5764.0199999999995s)]
*  some sort of pain most of the time. Right. Okay. You know, especially jujitsu, jujitsu training, [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5768.98s)]
*  like you're always hurt. So we saw something going on. What do you still carry to this day [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5774.0199999999995s)]
*  that you maybe you got hurt doing back in the day? Oh, I've had a bunch of surgeries. I've had my [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5778.74s)]
*  knees reconstructed, both my knees reconstructed. Okay. It's a lot of it is joint stuff and back [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5782.82s)]
*  stuff. Like everybody that I know that does jujitsu has some sort of a back issue or a neck issue. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5787.94s)]
*  So does, does, does, does weed or, you know, hallucinogens, or those, does that help any [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5792.66s)]
*  with, is it more for your mind stimulation or relaxation or does it help with any of your [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5798.5s)]
*  I think it's for everything. I think, well, I don't know if it helps with injuries. It definitely [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5802.9s)]
*  reduces inflammation, but there's a good argument that maybe inflammation is good for some injuries. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5806.9s)]
*  Oh, really? Yeah. Cause it's how the, the body's healing from it. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5811.0599999999995s)]
*  Okay. Like there's a, unless it's, unless it's your arteries, [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5814.66s)]
*  what's that? Unless you've got inflammation in your arteries. Yeah, that's not good. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5818.98s)]
*  But inflammation from injuries, like, so there's like two schools of thought and one school of [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5822.34s)]
*  thought is you should ice things immediately and calm down the inflammation. And the other school [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5826.099999999999s)]
*  of thought is really what you need is a heat and motion. And you need to kind of like let the body [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5830.26s)]
*  do its normal process. And there's a reason why it's inflamed following an injury. It's sending a [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5837.139999999999s)]
*  lot of blood to that area is trying to fix it. I don't know. I'm not smart enough. I've heard from [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5841.62s)]
*  very smart people, both things you should do. I've heard you should ice things and I've heard you [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5846.98s)]
*  should never ice things. I don't know what to say about that, but I do know that it does inhibit [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5851.38s)]
*  your growth and gains if you do it post lifting. So like if you lift weights and then you jump [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5857.54s)]
*  into the cold right afterwards, the reduction of inflammation actually equals less growth. So you [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5863.62s)]
*  get less what they call hypertrophy. Did you talk about talking about some guy that was doing cold [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5870.74s)]
*  plunges before his morning workout? That's what I was boosting testosterone. Yes, we read about [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5876.0199999999995s)]
*  that. There was a guy that he got. He had some sort of a test that showed that he might have cancer. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5880.26s)]
*  Okay. And they wanted to put him on certain medications. And he said, I want to try doing [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5889.86s)]
*  a ketogenic diet and doing the cold plunge every day. And so this guy shifted his diet and went to [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5895.7s)]
*  doing a cold plunge every day before his workouts and his testosterone rocketed. All of his problems [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5901.139999999999s)]
*  went away. He started feeling way healthier. But I think sometimes people need a little bit of a wake [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5906.74s)]
*  up call just to kind of straighten up your diet. And maybe it doesn't need to be keto, but maybe [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5911.78s)]
*  the benefit wasn't really from him doing keto, which may have been a benefit, but it also might [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5916.98s)]
*  have been when you're doing keto, you're not eating any bullshit. You can't eat potato chips. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5921.94s)]
*  You can't drink soda. You only get a certain amount of carbs per day. So you're trying to get [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5926.419999999999s)]
*  your body into this state where it's just burning fat. And just by doing that, you're eliminating [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5932.179999999999s)]
*  bullshit. And that's probably what's fucking with people more than anything. It's just bad food. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5937.62s)]
*  Do you cook your own food or do you have somebody? Yeah, I cook my own food. Yeah, I cook a lot. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5941.86s)]
*  What? Oh, gummy bear moment. Gummy bears are your friends, but sometimes they fuck you. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5945.46s)]
*  They leave you searching for your thoughts. Yeah. No, I love cooking. I really do. I love cooking [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5954.58s)]
*  meat, you know, especially like game meat, like wild game meat. Yeah, I see your Instagram with [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5959.86s)]
*  some of the elk stuff looks like, man, I'll be right over. I love it. I love cooking rib eyes too. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5963.62s)]
*  Right. Because I like to eat, I eat mostly meat. So I try to eat a lot of fat because I'm not getting [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5967.46s)]
*  much else. Do you take, so like when you go to, you know, go on the road for a fight or doing [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5973.7s)]
*  stand up, you bring like a cooler, you bring your stuff, some of your stuff with you? No, I just go [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5979.62s)]
*  to restaurants. Okay. Yeah, I have time for fucking coolers. Do you do much with intermittent fasting? [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5982.66s)]
*  Yeah, I do that all the time. Generally, I do at least 14 hours. Okay. So I generally like to work [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5987.78s)]
*  out in the morning fasted. Okay. You know, but it depends. Like sometimes like if I go, if I [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5993.38s)]
*  have a show late at night, like last night, my show was pretty late. Right. I was home until like 2 30 [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=5999.3s)]
*  in the morning. Okay. So then I had some food at night because I was just exhausted and tired. So [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6005.14s)]
*  then I ate, then I went to sleep and I woke up later. Right. So when I woke up, I just ate and [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6009.46s)]
*  then got my shit done because I'm like, listen, the fastings out the window. Right. I got tanked [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6013.62s)]
*  last night. Let's just like get something in and you know, get, get the sweat going and let's get [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6018.18s)]
*  rocking and then kind of get your body body back. But I do the cold plunge before anything. Okay. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6023.46s)]
*  I'm gonna try that out. It's I'm so accustomed to it now. It's, it still sucks. Like I still hate it. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6028.9s)]
*  I still think about it. But it's necessary. Well, it is really good for you. And it I feel so great [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6034.179999999999s)]
*  when I get out of it. And I'm important. More importantly, it's made my body much more resilient [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6040.5s)]
*  to cold. Like I warm up really quickly. Yeah. Like once I'm out, I could do the three minutes. And [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6046.339999999999s)]
*  I remember the first time I did, I was fucking cold for so long. Oh, you fucker. Oh, you fucking [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6051.0599999999995s)]
*  bitch. You dummy. What's wrong with you? Why are you doing this? Now I get out. I'm like, [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6056.1s)]
*  woof. Like my body's completely adapted to it. So I can start working out right away. How cold? [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6060.26s)]
*  What do you, what temperature do you find it? Oh, you go that low. Yeah. I do 34 for three [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6066.26s)]
*  minutes every morning. Wow. Do you have a chiller? Do you have ice or both? I have a Morosco cold [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6070.820000000001s)]
*  plunge at home, a Morosco forge. And here we have one called a blue cube. Okay. And they're both very, [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6074.900000000001s)]
*  very good. I want to see that. I've got one from Renu. I'll show you the blue cube. Okay. It's out [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6081.780000000001s)]
*  here. The blue cube we have with the studio and the blue cube, they're upgrading to this fucking [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6085.62s)]
*  insane one they have now. That's like a river. Okay. So you don't get a thermal layer over your [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6090.18s)]
*  body. So when you see the cold plunge. So the water's constantly circulating. Exactly. So it just. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6095.38s)]
*  Like you're sitting in a river. Keeps sucking. Okay. Never stops sucking. Oh, that's going to [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6098.82s)]
*  super chill your ass. Yeah. Because when you get it in the Morosco, it's amazing. And look, it ain't [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6102.34s)]
*  easy. Three minutes is a grind. At that temperature? Oh my gosh. But after a minute and a half or so, [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6106.9s)]
*  it gets more relaxed. Okay. And that's because you develop a thermal layer. Because when you [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6113.06s)]
*  get out, you know how your body gets like super red? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. That's what that is. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6117.9400000000005s)]
*  Okay. That's your body is forcing blood to try to warm up your skin. Okay. That's in contact with [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6121.3s)]
*  this cold. It's trying to prevent you from hypothermia. It's giving you some insulation. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6126.660000000001s)]
*  Yes. Yes. Okay. And so this blue cube one doesn't allow that. Okay. Because it's like [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6129.780000000001s)]
*  constantly running. Flowing through. It's constantly flowing. So it's torturous. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6134.5s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. I'm a wuss. I'm only down to 55 degrees. Oh, that's ridiculous. I shower in that. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6138.1s)]
*  That's outrageous. Ice cubes come out of your shower. I like cold showers too. Yeah. In the [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6144.1s)]
*  winter, it's great. Yeah. I love it. I love it in the winter. Oh, in the winter, it feels so good. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6147.46s)]
*  I love doing it right after the sauna. Yeah. Right into the cold shower. That's what I was going to ask you. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6151.54s)]
*  So what rotation, where does the dry sauna come in with cold plunge in the workout? It depends [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6155.9400000000005s)]
*  entirely on what kind of workout I'm doing. All right. What I really generally like to do is I [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6160.660000000001s)]
*  like to work out by doing cold plunge first always. Okay. And then I will have whatever [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6164.66s)]
*  workout I'm doing. I'm doing hard cardio, like if I'm doing bag workout or something like that. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6170.58s)]
*  Then I go right into the sauna afterwards. Okay. Because my heart rate is jacked. Okay. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6174.82s)]
*  So when my heart rate, when my resting, my heart rate after rounds, I'll do 10 rounds on the bag [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6178.5s)]
*  and it's still beating fast when I go in. So and then because of the heat, it's a static form of [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6184.9s)]
*  cardio. So when you go in- You're extending your workout. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6191.38s)]
*  Exactly. I'm extending my workout just sitting there and listening to a book. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6193.9400000000005s)]
*  Okay. So I'll just put air, if you want to do that though, get AirPod 1s, the original. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6196.9800000000005s)]
*  So slide out or? No, the original ones don't overheat. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6201.54s)]
*  Oh, really? The other ones die out. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6205.38s)]
*  Okay. Every fucking, I've tried a bunch of different companies, a bunch of different air, [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6207.22s)]
*  they all die except the original regular AirPods. Whichever one they sell, they'll sell like a Gen 2, [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6211.9400000000005s)]
*  but it's not the new ones. It's the old ones. The ones in the little tiny case, [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6217.94s)]
*  those ones don't die. Okay. Because they have less shit in them. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6223.46s)]
*  Interesting. The other ones have noise canceling and all that. They die quick. The pros, [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6225.86s)]
*  they eat a lot. And it's always the left one because I'm sitting with my left side to the heater. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6229.139999999999s)]
*  Okay. So it made me conscious of like switching sides. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6234.0199999999995s)]
*  So cold plunge, workout, if you got your heart rate up, definitely go straight into the dry sauna. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6237.54s)]
*  Yeah. And then you ever rotate back? [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6242.9s)]
*  Sometimes even when I lift weights, I'll go into the sauna. It depends on how much time I have, [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6244.66s)]
*  but what I really like is a sauna at night. I really like that when I come in from the club. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6248.58s)]
*  It relaxes you for bed, but it also, it centers my mind and it gives me an opportunity to have [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6254.34s)]
*  just a little bit more adversity at the end of the day, go through 20 minutes of this fucking [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6259.38s)]
*  189 degree sauna and steam and just, and listening to something. Generally I'm listening to a book. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6263.94s)]
*  And I'm just in there just thinking about shit. It's good alone time. I need alone time. It's [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6271.7s)]
*  very important. When's your alone time that you're not listening to the book, you're not [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6280.0199999999995s)]
*  thinking about learning- When I'm working out. When I'm working out. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6284.339999999999s)]
*  When I'm working out, it's just alone time. If I'm hitting the bag, either I listen to music [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6287.54s)]
*  or sometimes I don't listen to anything. I just want to hear the thumps. I just want to hear the [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6293.7s)]
*  You ever been in a fast go-kart? Not a fast one. We were in [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6298.660000000001s)]
*  Thailand. I think it was in Thailand with my family. We went to this place, they rent go-karts. We [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6304.26s)]
*  were whipping around and they were fun as shit. We were racing each other. It was a really good [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6309.780000000001s)]
*  time. Yeah, but a really fast, track-focused go-kart, for me, that's something that will take [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6314.02s)]
*  my mind off of everything because maybe a little bit like boxing or something in that [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6320.820000000001s)]
*  if I'm not focused at what I'm doing, I'm either going to fucking lose or get fucking hurt or both. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6325.54s)]
*  And so anyway, I just- Well, that's why I like- [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6331.379999999999s)]
*  Skiing fast and go-karts are what take my mind off of the world. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6333.299999999999s)]
*  But without getting hurt, you could do that with pool. That's what I like about pool. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6336.419999999999s)]
*  True, to some degree. And that's what I like about [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6339.299999999999s)]
*  archery as well. Archery, it's like when you're drawn back- [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6340.98s)]
*  A little bit of zen. Yeah, there's a thing that's happening where it's so difficult to do [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6344.179999999999s)]
*  that all you're thinking about is that thing and it's very mind cleansing because- [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6349.459999999999s)]
*  Fred Baer said that, something about a troubled man in a bow. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6353.46s)]
*  Right. Fred Baer was one of the original pioneers of bow hunting in this country. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6356.26s)]
*  But pool, to me, is one of the ultimate ones because you could do it at any time you want. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6360.98s)]
*  Anytime you have time, I can just go out there and set some drills up or just run some balls and it [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6366.34s)]
*  just frees my mind because you're a good pool player. When you're making a long shot, especially [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6372.099999999999s)]
*  a shot on that table, and you know you have to get pinpoint position on the next ball, there's so much [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6377.62s)]
*  going on. Did you ever play any street pool? [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6382.74s)]
*  Yeah, I did. I never really played one pocket, but I played a lot of street pool. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6384.18s)]
*  I played a little bit of one pocket. It's like a chess match. It's boring as shit. I like action. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6388.26s)]
*  I get it. It's hard to do. It's a great gambling game. Those guys that are really the Tony Choans. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6394.1s)]
*  Grady Matthews. Yeah, yeah. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6399.78s)]
*  They're chess masters is what they are. It's an intellectual game. Efren Reyes is amazing. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6404.26s)]
*  But it's not my thing. I like rotation. I like breaking. I like running out. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6408.900000000001s)]
*  All right, man. I'm your pool table date. Just let me know. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6414.02s)]
*  We're going to do this one hour and a half drive up from the factory. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6417.06s)]
*  We had a good time. It was fun. We just didn't have enough time. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6419.54s)]
*  That's all good. That's the thing. It's like you just get [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6423.62s)]
*  warmed up when you play for like an hour or two. Well, listen, brother, I appreciate you coming here [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6425.700000000001s)]

*  You just make wild shit. Whenever I look at your website, he's like, [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6435.78s)]
*  he's got a thousand horsepower Camaro. What the fuck are you doing? Exorcist. Jesus Christ, man. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6440.099999999999s)]
*  Everything is just so bonkers over the top. All of it. The GT500, not fast enough. What does it [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6446.9s)]
*  only have 700 horsepower? No, I thought we built a thousand horsepower one for- [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6453.139999999999s)]
*  Exactly, but from the factory. 700 from the factory. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6456.179999999999s)]
*  We built a thousand horsepower GT500 for Jim Farley, the CEO. And he, his son, went out and [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6458.34s)]
*  drove around Monterey, California last August and had a blast with it. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6462.82s)]
*  The fucking videos that you guys have of people sitting in the car and you see the acceleration. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6467.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh my God. I love that you're out there, brother. Appreciate you very much. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6472.66s)]

*  Thank you. Awesome. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6477.94s)]
*  All right. Goodbye. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFmuPcyAg2U&t=6478.42s)]
