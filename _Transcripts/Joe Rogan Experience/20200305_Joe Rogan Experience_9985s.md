# Joe Rogan Experience #1437 - Stephen Dubner
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 05, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DETj3ncN19g)
*  Ready on Jamie. Here we go. How are you sir? I'm great. Thanks. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.
*  Um we were talking before uh about Adam Curry who's just here who has these crazy ear enhancements
*  that are these software based so he can tweak it and change levels and stuff like that and you were
*  saying that you also have hearing but you got it from rock and roll. Yeah I mean honestly I've never
*  been tested. I just know that when I'm out eating with my family or friends that everybody can hear
*  everything and I can't hear anything so uh but no I yeah I played loud rock music for
*  six seven eight nine years and uh yeah it it it does what they say it does. Yeah they know what
*  they're doing. Those people that tell you not to do that. But look I like the technology like I have
*  older relatives who have a hearing aid or whatever they're called now hearing enhancement devices
*  that are like light years better than they used to be. Oh yeah yeah. So I figure if I can hold
*  that a couple more years mine are gonna like be so good they'll take out the garbage too. The ones
*  that Adam has sound pretty fucking amazing. Um he said it just sounds incredible and he can actually
*  tune into people that are 50 feet away 50 feet away having a conversation he can hear them. And
*  can you tune out people you don't like? That's a good question. I bet there is a way I bet he he
*  has various settings but I bet there's like a tone the world out setting. I don't need to tone
*  the world there are just some people. Sometimes. You know. Yeah. Have you used any of those airpods
*  that have the noise canceling technology? Oh not AirPods but I wear Bose noise cancelers
*  almost every day. I wear them a lot. You know when I started as a journalist in newsrooms
*  this was whatever early late 80s early 90s. I didn't like a newsroom is an open place and a
*  lot of people back then were on the phone doing your reporting. It was pre-internet reporting right.
*  And I didn't you're a writer you're writing and you're editing and I didn't understand how
*  people could think with all this din going on. I couldn't do it. So I started wearing just the
*  good foam earplugs are made by I flints I think is the brand that I use are kind of non tapered
*  and they're very thick and if you compress them and put them in it'll block out like you know 70
*  80 percent. So I've been shutting out the world for like 25 years now. So when the noise cancelers
*  got good I I've embraced them. Yeah. Yeah. Some people need it though right. They need that sound
*  like at the coffee shop like they love to go to coffee shops and all the milling around actually
*  helps their creativity. You know we're doing an episode right now Freakonomics Radio on
*  noise basically as you know kind of we got into it thinking about noise pollution right because
*  noise is a funny thing. It's what economists call an externality negative externality meaning
*  you can produce it and it affects me but you I don't I can't charge you for it right. It's
*  like pollution. If you have a big factory your pollution goes up it blows over to someone else.
*  That's an externality on them. So noise is that but what's really interesting is that there's a
*  huge variance in how different people receive and perceive noise as you just said. So some people
*  really need it and want it for some it's a burden and then there's all these rather weird
*  intricacies of noise like have you heard of mesophonia. You know what that is. I have heard
*  of it but I don't remember what it means. It is an intensely negative reaction when you hear other
*  people chewing or their mouths making any sound and it can be debilitating for people who have it
*  but then there's something called I'm going to get it wrong AMSR ASMR you know that. Yeah there's
*  all these videos online right. Right right yeah so that's it so noise is what does that stand for
*  though. I can I'd have to look it up. Automated sense or someone would have to look it up.
*  That's someone yeah but if someone screams in your ear unexpectedly and hurts your ear
*  that is a form of assault right. You don't think of it that way but if some if like if you saw a
*  girl she was standing there and a guy ran up to her and just in her ear and she's like and she's
*  like falls down because your ear hurts. I agree. You can do that with sound. What about when airports
*  play CNN at blast volume. Yeah that's I mean is that a form of assault borderline. What kind of
*  sweet deal to CNN have with airports. I think it kind of made everybody hate CNN blasting when you
*  don't want to hear it. That's right right. It shows that it's a little bit annoying but it's also it's
*  like you don't want to be looking at all the world's problems when you're about to get on the most
*  stressful thing that a person does. You have a flying you have to self-medicate pretty heavily
*  before flying. No I don't have to. You enjoy it. I enjoy it more. Yeah well this is what I the way
*  I think of it. On a plane one of two things gets either get some work done or get some entertainment.
*  I watch a movie on the laptop or I'll get some writing in. Right. Or I can get really really high
*  and then get on that and just freak the fuck out and make it but go through a roller coaster ride
*  of thoughts and and a lot of times I wind up writing too you know. Wait when you get high you have a
*  worse experience on the plane? No no it's not worse. It's just scary. It's not worse. And scary is not
*  worse. No because there's benefits to it. There's benefits in terms of like creativity and then
*  insight and like just I have a whole bit about it but it is based on the truth. Like I oftentimes
*  take a heavy dose of edibles and then get on a plane. In order to intentionally put yourself in
*  a state that can be somewhat negative but also creativity. I don't I see I don't use that word
*  negative. Interesting. I don't think of it as negative even when I'm freaking out. Like if I'm
*  sitting in the chair and I'm like whoo and you know I'm looking out the window we're flying and
*  I'm realizing we're 30 000 feet in the air and I'm you know really fucking high. Is this uh so I'm
*  not a like a roller coaster person. I don't like roller coasters. But is this a similar kind of
*  like you put your you intentionally put yourself in a scenario where you're going to heighten some
*  senses? Is that the idea? No because I think a roller coaster is just fun right. It's just goofs.
*  This is a an essential thing you're doing. You're traveling to a place where you're going to and as
*  you're doing it you're incredibly vulnerable right. You're immobilized in a chair while you're going
*  500 miles an hour in the sky right. You're like whoa already you're like a little weirded out if
*  you look out the window. But now when you're really really really high it puts you in this very strange
*  state and you start thinking about your life and you start thinking about how you talk to people.
*  You start thinking about things that you've learned and documentaries that you find fast
*  you start dwelling on weird things and then you know oftentimes I'll either watch something or
*  I'll start writing. So I get something very productive out of what would be dead time.
*  It makes me it fires up my whatever it is that creates creativity for me whatever the the source
*  of it for me for some reason it gets enhanced oftentimes by being on a plane on edibles. How
*  uh predictable though is the experience? Unpredictable. Right so is that not a little
*  frightening? That's the fun part. You're the lunatic. Yeah a little bit but it's not
*  nobody gets hurt that's the thing. Yeah it's not like a real fear. And in the back of your mind
*  you know this is just a yeah a physiological chemical response and I'm gonna. Exactly exactly
*  and uh I mean that's what paranoia really is marijuana based paranoia if I had to guess.
*  It's a hyper awareness that you're not not comfortable with and so in taking in all these
*  things it's like if you just can't settle in you're recognizing every threat that's around you all
*  the time the fact that a rock could come out of the sky the fact that the the tsunami could hit
*  at any moment the earth could shake what if a supervolcano blows up all those things that you
*  know to be real all of a sudden get dragged. You put yourself back into caveman mode like every
*  rustle of grass is the lion who's coming to eat. Exactly. All right let me ask you a question.
*  Sorry I realize I'm not supposed to be asking you questions but I'm gonna ask you. No you're talking man.
*  Here's a question um let's say for people who don't use drugs. Yeah. Right. But they hear you
*  say this and like they say wow that is I recognize the value of putting yourself
*  in a place emotionally cognitively kind of unleashing yourself or maybe putting yourself
*  in a new place where you're going to have thoughts big thoughts maybe scary thoughts
*  is there a way to do that that you know of the without drugs? Yeah we were just talking about
*  that with Adam in fact. We were talking about holotropic breathing and he has had some
*  experiences with holotropic breathing. It's like a meditation based breathing routine that
*  for whatever reason it activates psychedelic chemicals in your brain and you can really trip
*  out and he was talking about how he's flying for like a half an hour and I've had various
*  friends do it. I've yet to experience it. You've tried it? No yet I've yet to experience it but
*  I've had various friends who've done it who have had spectacular experiences like like full-blown
*  mushroom experiences for several minutes. And is it guaranteed like if you do the breathing is it
*  guaranteed to get you to that state or no? No I think you have to learn how to get there. Not as
*  reliable as drugs then? Right and also physically demanding like I think it takes a long time. I
*  think you have to work yourself up into this state where this stuff starts to happen and you also
*  have to probably follow some routine that's tried and true. Right. I don't know what that routine is
*  but I do know that people that I trust including people like Adam super smart guys will tell you
*  for them it gave them the same experience as like taking a drug. All right I'm going to look it up
*  because I'm not big on drugs. I don't know why. Just not. Because you're smart. No I'm not I'm also
*  not judgmental about it. I know but no issue. I'm not saying that you would be dumb to do them but
*  I see you're a smart guy. So if you're a smart guy and you see drugs you see a lot of people
*  have problems with drugs and you're fine with reality. Yeah I mean I smoked dope in college and
*  it just I mean also the dope was. You sound like a cop.
*  Believe me son I smoke dope. But also the dope was a different caliber then. It wasn't very good. It
*  wasn't very predictable and it just I just had bad experiences so whatever. I like whiskey. Me too.
*  And I like the predictability of like even like the difference between if I drink my LeFrogue is
*  my favorite scotch like and if there's not that and there's another. That's that stuff we had the
*  other day. We had Lagvulin. Lagvulin is good. Lagvulin is good. They're very close.
*  It's the PD family. Some people don't like the PD stuff. Oh PD. Yeah that was the first time I
*  think I ever had anything like that. Oh you've never had a. The bottle was half empty though so
*  I don't know what the fuck happened. I was probably so drunk that I was drinking it and not even
*  realizing it was PD. It's a nice thing about scotch though. You can sip it kind of forever.
*  Yeah. If you're you know. That stuff too I would imagine is even better when you're gently sipping
*  because you're dealing with this really exotic flavor. It's also good for you. Is it really?
*  Let me rephrase. It's not bad for you. In terms of alcohol I mean beer look it depends how crazy you
*  want to be about caloric consumption and so on but beer has a lot of calories. Wine has a lot of
*  sugar and whiskey is actually pretty low cal low sugar just high alcohol content so the sugar works
*  a little bit differently but no my doctor fully approves of a couple drinks a night. Yeah there's
*  been research that shows that a couple of drinks a night for most people is actually. In fact my
*  doctor who's a researcher as well she said that if you look at longevity the people who have the
*  shorter life expectancies are the people who drink a lot not a surprise and none. So it's the people
*  who drink from like one and a half to maybe two and a half maybe a little bit more drinks a day
*  have the longest life expectancy. She doesn't know though whether it's the tea totalers why
*  do they live long shorter it may be because they can't alleviate the stress maybe you know it could
*  be that alcohol does have physiological benefits we don't know but the message seems to be that
*  everybody should drink a little bit. Yeah there's got to be a benefit in relaxation there's got to
*  be. You know I was listening to your podcast on loneliness and statistics it's really good. I love
*  your podcast by the way. I'm a big fan. Thank you. And that one you know talking about loneliness and
*  that whole correlation how they came to the conclusion that it's like 15 cigarettes a day
*  but that a bad feeling that a bad feeling is bad for you and a good feeling is probably good for
*  you and the little trade-off health wise like I kind of feel like you can get make that up in the
*  gym and like you could achieve like a good balance. There's something about like having a drink every
*  now and then it's nice. You want to hug people you want to have smiles. Agree. It relaxes you.
*  Also you know this is a phrase that younger people will not remember but actually I can't
*  remember it either so I think it's the social lubricant. That's what they used to call alcohol
*  right and so the fact is is that a lot of people have a lot of trouble communicating with other
*  people period. Whether it's loved ones you either say you're too candid or you're not candid enough
*  with strangers so a lot of people have a hard time being with other people kind of in the way
*  they want to and if alcohol can act as that kind of take the edge off as they say it's an interesting
*  but I'm always looking for ways I'm always trying to isolate the places or the
*  circumstances where I get good ideas and the problem is it's very it's unpredictable. Walking
*  is the one thing that I found and the fact is is that writers throughout history a lot of creative
*  people throughout history have embraced walking. Now in the old days it was one of the few things
*  that you kind of could do you know you you weren't going to go out and well I guess you could have
*  played golf or whatever but people have been walking for a long time and they say that there's
*  something about what the brain and body do in concert with each other on a walk which is you're
*  kind of mapping you're kind of decoding you're kind of figuring but you're also getting some
*  physiological stimulation and I find that's one that's pretty good but I wish there was a
*  thing I could do to make the good ideas flow because that's the hard part. I don't I think
*  if there was a thing other than show up and start writing if there really was a thing it would cheap
*  and whatever the fuck it is that makes you have those weird thoughts that come across like where
*  did that come from? Yeah. A gift from the heavens. Yeah no the mystery is beautiful. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah but walking to me I didn't really walk until really recently I didn't go on hikes or anything
*  until really recently I usually would run and running a lot of times you know you're just so
*  tired you're not having any good ideas you're just thinking like I gotta get to this topic. How long
*  you lived in LA? Since 94. And before that? I lived in this is my whole thing New Jersey until I was
*  seven San Francisco from seven to eleven Florida from eleven to thirteen Boston from thirteen to
*  twenty-four New York from twenty-four to twenty-six ish twenty-seven maybe before twenty-seven I'm on
*  the west coast. Okay so did you find that in Boston and New York which are easily the best walking
*  places of all those places you just said did you walk a lot more there and did it change anything
*  for you? No I was busy. Well I was 20 you know my early 20s. You were working in clubs in New York
*  at that age right? I was working in clubs in New York and I was doing a lot of road gigs and I was
*  playing a lot of pool and I was hanging around with a bunch of comedians and I wasn't going on
*  any hikes. Right. We were you know I would go to the gym occasionally and work out but we're doing
*  comedy you know but as a grown-up and I usually run with my dog he loves to run and I haven't been
*  able to run recently because of a little injury so like for the last two months I've just been
*  walking with him and then hiking on the trails and he runs around and when I was doing I was
*  realizing like I can listen to podcasts or I can listen to music or I could just do it silent and
*  when I do it silent it's like really interesting there's there's there's inner dialogue that starts
*  playing out it's like you're having a conversation with yourself that's a little therapeutic so I go
*  on these hour walks with my dog at the end of it you know I feel like I've got some better handle
*  on stuff. I wonder what you're saying makes me think and I hope it's not too late for our episode
*  on noise because this is actually a component that'd be good to get at is like the way you just
*  described quiet or solitude whatever it is right? I think almost everybody who hears that would say
*  I definitely see the value of that because you know you need time to process your thoughts to
*  to feel things whatever but it does make me wonder the world is obviously more noisy now than it used
*  to be yeah way more and I do wonder if you just get conditioned out of even thinking about that
*  like my kids who are teenagers like I don't see them ever having silence or solitude right and
*  again I don't want to be judging I don't want to be the generation because every generation
*  thinks that what the next generation does is horrible like the people you know the
*  Rolling Stones came the people who like Perry Como said this is the worst music ever
*  and then the people after that said the Rolling Stones you know etc but I do wonder how much we're
*  losing by not having availability of that quiet because you kind of it's unless you build your
*  life to have a lot of silence which I do because I'm a writer and I sit alone all day
*  um not many people get to have that and I wonder what the loss is there's got to be something
*  because there's a shift in intention is a attention rather and there's a shift in focus
*  that's dramatic we've gone from just looking at the world around us to fixated on a device
*  you know you look at people's phone time it's a lot of times it's six hours in a day just
*  constantly on their phone on the toilet constantly on their phone when they go to get a coffee
*  on their phone at their desk texting people while they're walking to the other office they're
*  texting and walking down the hallway I mean most people are on those goddamn things all day long
*  and there's for sure you're putting energy into that little device which means you're not putting
*  energy into thinking without that device and though you might think of it as a well I'm just
*  I'm still paying attention I'm just doing this but you're not you're not dedicating any resource to
*  being bored and thinking about shit and they're just walking and talking to yourself yeah thinking
*  to yourself and there's something about like a long hike you take a dog for a couple mile hike
*  where you're just walking and you hear crunch crunch crunch crunch and you're just thinking and
*  no one's talking to you and you're not talking to anybody you're just walking and talking with
*  your dog and then you're thinking about stuff in a way that is like a tangible sort of meditation
*  on your life it's a it's a real moment and we don't value that real moment we think of it almost as
*  like waste I don't not even listening to anything no good tunes but it's really like there's value
*  in thinking and we we we haven't put a value judgment or a number judgment on that
*  it's interesting some of the people you hear these days talking the most about uh really limiting or
*  even forbidding their kids screen time is silicon valley executives oh yeah that's where you know
*  they're smart yes you have to say like you know at a certain point you have to say okay the writing
*  is on the wall here but on the other hand look every technology that's ever been invented
*  people get scared of it people embrace it people trash it and then you know for sure for sure
*  um you there's there's always a thing where there's an example in history where people are wrong
*  but then there's the reality of what it is what it is is an ever increasingly immersive experience
*  that everyone is addicted to and when you're walking through a starbucks and just see nothing
*  but people on their phones like people in line are on their phones people sitting down around
*  their phones you go through a mall everyone's on their phone you go through a movie theater
*  people can't put their fucking phone down while movies on people are driving they're on their
*  phone on the other hand but you got to consider the upsides too oh there's a lot of i mean even
*  in the even in the environment you're describing that sounds like let's say starbucks everybody's
*  on the phone you got to think well wait a minute maybe that person over there who looks like
*  they're a slave to it maybe they are maybe they're sending a text to their grandma
*  that they wouldn't have done they wouldn't have been able to do 10 years ago sure so that's the
*  tricky part i mean that's why that's why i like economists because economists are ruthless
*  bloodless they almost don't know what humans are but they're very good at measuring costs and
*  benefits and that's what i feel that our kind of political social media discourse is missing
*  people are all for the most part advocates or activists they pick up lane and they stay in it
*  and they want to pave over the rest of everybody's lanes and make it theirs yes and it's not a good
*  way to be no it's not you know that's another episode that i was listening to of yours recently
*  about how hard it is to get people to change their mind on things and uh i forget who the
*  expert was who was talking but it was a really interesting point that he had about the mind
*  like people say change your mind you don't really have a mind you have the mind of the community
*  and if you step outside the beliefs of the community it can be very bad for you in terms
*  of like your personal connections with people and i really enjoyed that episode it's funny
*  thanks it's a it's a paradox though because the way you just said it like if you are in your tribe
*  then even though it can be healthier for you and for presumably many other people for you to change
*  your mind or at least think differently about things right you you risk losing credibility
*  or whatever yeah well i mean some religions i mean that's how they keep you right you get ostracized
*  there's there's religions that we know for you if you decide to leave you don't just get ostracized
*  you're you're literally you have a death sentence like now you've you've escaped our group you are
*  you're an outsider now my father who can both my parents converted from judaism to catholicism
*  before they met each other whoa yeah it was it was very unusual how did that happen uh it's a long
*  story i'll tell you if you really want to know but anyway i'll i'll do the short what i'm getting to
*  and this was during the during the second world war they were both in new york both first generation
*  uh american jews that makes sense they converted for different reasons from each other and then
*  they met my father's family was orthodox um and his father guy named schepsel dubner uh who'd come
*  here when he was in his maybe late 20s from poland he still lived his every day in brooklyn as if he
*  were still in poland he didn't change at all when my father converted and his father found out my
*  father was in the war he was overseas he was home on leave and his father was cleaning up and from
*  my father's pants that he'd left over a chair rosary beads slipped out and fell on the floor
*  that's how his jewish father schepsel dubner found out that his son had become a catholic
*  so what he did is he proceeded to sit shiva for him the jewish mourning ritual where for seven
*  days you mourn the dead he he declared that he would never again speak to his son and he forbade
*  everyone in his family from speaking to his son so i by the time i was born i was the youngest
*  of eight kids in this family because they'd become very catholic i didn't know this whole
*  family of my father's was unknown to me entirely so they did exactly what you're saying now
*  holy shit yeah yeah that was what i thought too when i holy shit and my mother's did the same
*  thing but it was less dramatic because her family was less religious so they still didn't like it
*  all that she had converted um but uh yeah any children uh yeah i got a couple i'm jewish again
*  though i it's a long so my first the first book i wrote long before freakingomics was called
*  turbulent souls although it got then republished under a different title called choosing my religion
*  and it tells this this story of my uh my two parents and then me yeah i would love to hear
*  that but i just want to put in your head that what i was going to ask you is like how could you
*  imagine a scenario where you would be capable of doing that to your children so uh no chance
*  no chance no chance but it's so scary yeah it's scary it is but on the other hand i mean this is
*  um what freakingomics is what i try to learn through doing freakingomics is you know to measure
*  the what and try to figure out the why but then not be the judge who says that was terrible this
*  is wonderful because you know different people have look if shepseldubner were here we could ask him
*  what's your side of the story he could tell us a story that might convince us that you know what
*  this son of his did a terrible thing to the family he did a terrible thing you know he would say how
*  could it be that we jews existed for generations and generations and generations when everywhere
*  we lived there was always someone trying to you know get rid of us and then we finally come to
*  america you know the land of freedom religious freedom economic freedom and here after generations
*  and generations of forefathers fought to stay jewish here my son decides to become catholic
*  what are you thinking so you know everybody everybody's got a perspective everybody's got an
*  emotional experience so i try to respect that but no i would not do that to my children i understand
*  the outrage i understand being upset but i can't understand choosing that over your son and over
*  the relationship you have with your son yeah it's ridiculous the the saddest end of the stories and
*  when that grandfather my grandfather who i never met this was a long time ago my father's father
*  my father died when i was very young so i didn't know the story either that was why i wrote this
*  first book was to try to figure out this all the stuff i'm telling you now none of this i
*  knew until i was in my like 20s when i was writing this book but when schepsel dubner was dying of
*  cancer in the maybe late 50s or so a nephew of his who my father used to be very close with and
*  who looked a lot like my dad and this guy was maybe in his early 20s late teens by now he walked into
*  the hospital room and schepsel you know on his deathbed really thought that that was my father
*  his son my dad's name was solomon he called him schleim and he was he was calling out to him
*  schleim as if he was you know happy happy to see him it wasn't him though and my father didn't go
*  visit his own father dying in the hospital because he'd been forbidden to go anywhere near
*  yeah so it was terrible so look this is why religion i've been long fascinated by religion
*  and i think that again if you think about it the way that economists think about things
*  there are costs and there are benefits and it's complicated i think you're 100 right and they
*  think that's hard for people to handle and you know people are hardcore atheists where they
*  don't see any value in it whatsoever even though people are they're they're getting some sort of
*  ethical value moral value and the way i always put it is like it's like a scaffolding to live
*  your life by you can live within these confines and it really kind of makes sense if you follow
*  it loosely that we're doing to try to for the benefit of community it's also like a real
*  community sense that comes from meeting and sunday with all those other or whatever day it is with
*  your your religion and you meet in a group of other people that are also in the community and
*  you all basically are saying together that we should do good things and be good to people and
*  treat each other the way god would want us to like all that has undeniable benefits and
*  anybody that says differently is like you're diluting yourself like your points the atheists
*  who are hardcore who make points about the preposterous nature of a lot of religious
*  texts they're on the money but it doesn't mean doesn't mean that it doesn't give people a benefit
*  and that i i couldn't even disagree with them continuing it because there's a lot of people
*  that benefit greatly from religion someone wrote to us after that uh loneliness episode came out
*  um and said how did you fail to write about uh this supposed epidemic of loneliness without
*  addressing the huge decline in organized religion in america which i thought was a very good piece
*  of criticism that would have been a good because you're right it's a community yeah one other thing
*  i would add to the list that you provided of what it can give is humility right because you know
*  if you have an image of some superior being god deity whatever you want to call it
*  you kind of understand that one mortal is you know the world does not revolve around me the
*  other thing i would say and look i it's hard for me to scientifically logically embrace a lot of
*  the arguments that a lot of religions make especially about things like the afterlife
*  right that said even to an atheist i would suggest one way to think about it is if someone does
*  believe in those rewards or if in economic terms we're talking about them as incentives
*  even if it's a placebo effect in other words if i if i'm encouraged to do to treat other people
*  well on this on the chance that if i do so i have a reward an internal reward hey that's not a bad
*  reason to incentivize people to do well sounds like a nice justification for one of them psychic
*  houses you drive by they get the neon sign they're helping people they're giving people a sense what
*  the future is going to be like how do you know they're not hope it might be imagine if that's
*  where the real psychics are those neon signs maybe that's where god lives it could be i went
*  to one of them in brooklyn by the way uh the only one i ever went to i was in brooklyn for an audition
*  in the early 90s and i'm like why not fuck it it was like 10 bucks or something i walked into this
*  lady she's wrong about everything she thought i had a brother she thought i was trying to get into the
*  family business you're really tight with your dad no i don't even know him like it was it was it was
*  a disaster all right so maybe you didn't you need we need like a yelp for psychics and that one
*  wouldn't have been the good one yeah i think if we're gonna do something like that we bring in
*  james randy we have him go by the rules and someone like pendulet who will be able to because he
*  understands all those carny tricks where they do where they can pretend that they're psychic just
*  by leading you into questions but you know what's funny i think he's a pretty strongly professed
*  atheist right right but somehow i find his talking about the subject incredibly like embracing like
*  he doesn't right because it's a smart way of doing it he understands a generous person he is he's a
*  really really nice person and that's even if he disagrees with you on something he's he'll laugh
*  and joke around but he's um he's a nice person like he'll he'll let you have these conversations
*  and and not like some people try to shove their atheism down your throat and like mock you and
*  just don't all you're doing is reinforcing the ideas of these people because you're acting like
*  an asshole so they're like well that i'm now connecting atheism with assholes so fuck atheists
*  fucking assholes you know then that's what people do it's like a natural
*  but if someone's nice you know um did you ever uh do you know the story of darryl davis
*  darryl davis is a gentleman who's been on this podcast before and he is a musician by trade
*  but he has converted over 200 different guys to leave um the kkk and nazi organizations wow and
*  he's converted it by becoming their friend because he was doing a show and this guy came i'm
*  butchering it and i'm sorry darryl but this is what he said on the podcast i'm sure you do a
*  better job of telling the story but he was at a show and he was playing in this band and this guy
*  said you were really good you know and he sat down with the guy and the guy said i never had a drink
*  with a black guy before he's like how is that possible and he shows him his card he's in the
*  kkk and so he's like he goes well how you're having a rational conversation with me a normal
*  conversation with me like you you really think that black men are evil or black men are dumb and
*  and they have this conversation a civil conversation and then he gives the guy his uh i think he gave
*  him his phone number said uh i'll call you when i'm back in town if you want to have this conversation
*  again and so then they become friends and so they go back and forth for like months hanging out and
*  then three three months or so into the friendship the guy brings his kkk outfit he goes i want to
*  give this to you because i'm never wearing it again he goes i'm done and from being this guy's
*  friend unreal and so then he meets a bunch of other ones he starts talking to them and just
*  nice as pie just nice friendly intelligent super articulate too so it's hard to hard to describe
*  him as dumb when he's way smarter than you right you're talking to him and he's he's so eloquent
*  so he converts more and more and more it converted a guy who was a nazi who's a he's he's converted a
*  bunch of people it's more than 200 now and he continues to do and there's been there's some
*  pieces about it online but hearing him say it hearing him talk about is the most amazing he
*  just he grew up in a way that he didn't really experience racism until he came to uh america
*  i think he's like six years old he's from italy right that's where he was from before that up
*  until then i think somewhere where he just didn't experience it and then when he was a little boy
*  people were throwing things at him in a parade and he had no idea he couldn't understand it
*  he'd never he didn't know and they had to pull him aside and say it's because you're black he's like
*  what like he couldn't believe it so because the fact that he didn't have it in his early childhood
*  and then he had it when he was a young boy and realize how crazy it was that he didn't experience
*  this before this one moment and became obsessed with it was italy he this his wikipedia says he
*  grew up all over the world um but when he came back when when he was 10 he was in an all-white
*  cub scout pack in massachusetts yeah so that's what it was so he was 10 years old and man if
*  you want to pick somewhere to experience kind of straight up racism massachusetts is a good place
*  to start i was definitely some spots i have some thoughts on that i feel like there's that heirloom
*  civilization that still like it landed there from boats just a couple of decades ago i mean my
*  grandparents came over um in the i think they were here in the the 20s from where the 30s from
*  italy and ireland everybody came from somewhere right there's mostly most of them three of them
*  came from italy one of them came from ireland so i'm three quarters italian but it's the the families
*  of those people were risk-taking savages they didn't even have a video to watch right they just
*  jumped in a fucking boat and hoped america was better and then when they got there they got
*  checked in at ellis island they they started working in factories and scratching and clawing
*  and there's just a lot of struggle that's still in that part of the world that you when you come
*  to california one of the first things you feel is like a lighter a lighter sense of discourse
*  than the east coast is the east coast i always felt like people had their guard up a little bit
*  more a little bit more tense a little bit more like what the fuck did you say there was a little
*  bit more of that a little bit more sketchy people just the the echoes of the savage past is still in
*  the soil you know i i hear you but there's also so the thing that i like about new york i don't mean to
*  trash california i like california a lot i love new york but man when i'm in california
*  first of all it feels much more like a foreign country to me than any other place in america
*  maybe what makes it seem like a foreign country um it feels uh because i feel people have
*  a manner and a style that is totally divorced from this intensity that i'm used to right
*  in new york now i grew up on a farm in upstate new york so i grew up not in the hurly burly new
*  york city was scared because my parents once they converted and they became catholic they need to
*  have someplace where you could have tons of kids so we grew up in the middle of nowhere so i grew
*  up i was a farm kid and um so the intensity of a city scared me until ultimately i moved to new york
*  for a variety of reasons and then i then i caught the bug and now i love cities so i love california
*  but when i come here i feel like it's uh running on a different voltage you know yeah and i am
*  envious of people's ability to run like that like they seem right like their shoulders like you look
*  at me i'm sitting here my shoulders are always up to my ears like kind of just a built-in tension
*  and i feel like i thrive on it maybe i do i mean things have worked out okay but uh like i say when
*  i look at look at the way people are sort of congenitally relaxed i envy it on the other
*  hand i think that that intensity produces some things that i i like a lot like i like i also
*  like the environment of a uh you know of university campus the to me the tricky part is uh there's
*  that fine line between intensity and competition that treats it like a zero-sum game so i don't
*  like to be around environments where people are trying to win so that they can beat somebody else
*  except in sports that's why sports are awesome sports are a good proxy for life people can be
*  very competitive you win or lose you go home you come back and do it again because you've lost it
*  doesn't make you a bad person right um sports are very valuable i think for also for war you know
*  i mean it's well that was football yeah that's the reason why i invented it right you know about
*  population densities right that you know you can accurately depict or detect how many people live
*  in a given area by putting a camera on one red light and then a camera on another red light and
*  then as the people walk by measure how fast they walk no kidding yeah i didn't know that and when
*  they do that um if they they do i assume faster is denser yes faster is denser also how many
*  syllables that they say uh per sentence how quickly they say those syllables um that there's actually
*  a cadence a speed that an uptick what are you talking about what are you talking about i don't
*  believe what you're saying what the fuck are you saying bro then there's a people get to the chase
*  cut to the chase and i think that that urge to walk faster that urge to talk faster is an energy
*  and that energy you know we're looking at in terms of its results right the results are
*  you can actually detect if you know the formula you look at a camera here and a camera there you
*  know a timer so someone walked from here to there you add it all up and you can guess like really
*  accurately within a million people pretty neat someone lives it yeah yeah i think it's because
*  there's energy that comes out of cities my friend jeff lives in new york my my manager he's lived
*  there forever and uh he loves it he goes i never leave new york i love new york the fucking energy
*  of this city because it gives him juice right i think not everybody we should say right not for
*  everybody some people i think just get weirded out by and they need to be alone and some people
*  like a yard and some people like peace and quiet but some people live for that bad bad
*  fuck you they live they live for being stacked on top of a building with strangers below them and
*  everyone's all together in this hive feeding off each other you know what's interesting is you know
*  how old are you 52 okay so i'm 56 so great thank you ditto uh so we're the same roughly generation
*  and we remember that back when you know computerization was starting and the internet
*  was starting that all the predictions were that you know now anybody can do anything from everywhere
*  so nobody's going to have any reason to have to live anywhere and cities are just going to empty
*  remember that exactly wrong around the world the more digital we've gotten the more in fact the
*  urban population now the share of the human population that's urban is higher now than it's
*  ever been in the history of the world it's unbelievable so what that says to me is and this
*  is not about new york versus california anymore what that says to me is even when you can engage
*  with people remotely or have a lot of space whatever there's something about humans wanting
*  to rub up against each other physically intellectually etc it is incredibly strong
*  and i'm able that's why going to live see live music and things like that is it's a shared
*  experience you're all seeing something live there's a benefit to that and i always tell people like
*  if you watch a comedy special on television you that comedy special is at the very best 70
*  is good as seeing it live it's never 100 because you're not there so it might be great because
*  it's a funny person but you're missing for sure at least 30 and then you know when you're live
*  there's like this intangible quality you feel it in the air when you're all laughing there's a
*  buzz that everybody gets you're laughing together yeah like right now it reminds me of um i once
*  watched somebody else's wedding video i can't remember the circumstances somebody forced at
*  gunpoint it was pretty close to that and and they said it was some uh it was somebody showing me
*  like their siblings wedding video because they thought it was they said it was such an amazing
*  experience it was so warm and i was watching it and i felt like i was watching a detergent commercial
*  like no emotional connection because i wasn't there i wasn't there that's the worst thing that
*  people make you do when they make you sit and watch there the only thing worse is someone was
*  in a really bad band and they want you to listen to their album believe in front of you yeah and
*  you have to sit there and go dude you're making me do this when i played music uh my uh so i had
*  i never so first of all when i started in this band i was in we were in north carolina and my
*  family was mostly up in new york state and so on so they weren't close but then when we started to
*  travel and tour and and whatnot we would get within their range and they'd come to see us
*  these are like my older siblings who i love they're great people but i would say to them
*  i don't think this really is going to be for you it's going to be pretty loud raucous rock
*  and roll a little bit punky a little bit whatever and they're like no no i want to come see little
*  brother so then they'd see a show i remember this one show we played at the old ritz in new york
*  and i remember my brother who's a musician by the way and a very good musician but much more refined
*  than i was he came up and he said you guys really looked like you were having fun up there like we
*  weren't i wasn't you had so much uh energy up there so yeah the difference between the
*  experience from the inside and perceived experience was a massive gap yeah for sure
*  yeah going to see something live like that where it's bad is actually extra super painful like
*  when you watch a comedian bomb on stage and you're in the audience you're feeling agony
*  like you're mad at this person for putting you through this like oh my god you can't be mad at
*  him though don't you isn't it more empathy than anger for sure yeah but sure but there's a lot
*  of anger too because you are you are being tortured like imagine if and it's not really
*  physical pain but there is a certain level of emotional pain you experience when someone's
*  bombing when someone's in front of you like oh god especially me because i've done stand up for so
*  many years like i know what it's like to bomb i've bombed so i see someone bombing i'm like yikes i
*  gotta get out of here i can't take it it's almost like my guts are on fire the thing i always
*  wondered about comics is why they don't cheat more because laughter is plainly very contagious
*  right yeah so every time i've seen someone bomb i always felt like if one or two people had started
*  going with it laughing responding you mean cheat more by packing the audience something laughing
*  something or just putting your iphone in the audience and having it start laughing i don't
*  know how to there's a lot of ways to cheat because i've always thought that it's such a
*  it's such an obvious dynamic that laughter really is very very contagious but even like you see like
*  kids in school when they're supposed to not be laughing and one kid laughs they they all can't
*  stop it's this incredibly contagious behavior so i think if you did pipe in laughter first of all
*  i'm not saying well maybe i am saying that yeah you can kind of say with a phone in the audience
*  okay that's most drastic let's say you plant people in the audience right you could probably
*  swing things in a way from a really bad set to maybe an okay set but you're never going to make
*  it funny see all the best way to do that is to just make it funny actually because yeah yeah
*  because to bother to be good that's not that cheating thing's not helping you ever it's like
*  it's going to get in the way you make a good point you're not going to learn anything from it it's like
*  people that steal other people's jokes they never learn how to write you know they they you have to
*  figure out the language of it and when you're up there if you're just doing fake laughs in the
*  background to juice it up you're not going to know how to get real ones yeah you're going to
*  feel weird about it you're going to be also you're going to know that you're doing it and the audience
*  is going to know that something's wrong you're going to there's a feeling so maybe i'm not talking
*  about cheating per se as you're making sense as having uh as having some and i'm sure every comic
*  does this already so it's not like i'm telling anybody anything but having some something in
*  your pocket that's going to get them on your side even if for a little while just to get the
*  momentum going in your way we certainly do have some bits that you know work because like when
*  you say like if you bomb or somebody else bombs you could give exactly the same set an hour later
*  to a slightly different crowd and it would go great right sometimes sometimes you're bombing
*  because you get off on a bad start like you'll you'll come up with like the real sketchy time
*  is when you're writing new material that's when that's touch and go the way i always like to
*  describe it's like you have no weapons like you're going into a fight but everything's made out of
*  rubber like fuck like nothing's good yet right like when you you have new material you have a
*  stack of notes and like four or five premises and one or two of them might be any good but i gotta
*  go through those other premises that suck multiple times to find out for sure that they're no good
*  all right let me ask you a question when that's happening to you do you learn over time to not
*  let it hurt your ego to the point where you're going to get even worse in other words if you're
*  not doing well what you need to do is you need to say i've got this material i need to work on it
*  because it's going to get better but i could imagine that if you start bombing what happens
*  is you just feel so hurt that you get worse and worse as you go how do you fight against that
*  yeah it's a psychological mind game for sure you you definitely could look and i've seen it happen
*  to comedians while they're writing a whole new hour it's almost like they they lose their glow
*  as a human because they're just eating shit all the time and we get away from them like they're
*  diseased like if some bombs and they come off stage like you get away from them because we know what
*  it's like i don't want to feel contagious a little bit yeah it's you got to get out of the room like
*  one of the worst things that people do and i don't know why they do it but a lot of
*  comedians like to bring terrible comedians with them on the road so that they look like a hero
*  it's a really sneaky move and they they literally hire people that don't work any other way is that
*  a bad idea ultimately terrible idea because you want everybody to have fun and if you make them
*  sit through 20 minutes of someone who's terrible you're torturing them are you do you end up
*  lowering your own standard because you're around shitty people the vibe of the show you it just
*  fucks it up if especially if you're doing it on purpose you know there's a thing that's going on
*  on stage that's not quantified and is that there's a mass hypnosis that's happening when someone is
*  killing for me as an audience member my recognition of this is as a person who performs it and also
*  as an audience member when i'm an audience member and someone's killing i'm letting them think for
*  me right i'm not even thinking i'm just like letting them take me down a trail like say like
*  david tell david tell was at the improv the other night we worked together and he was fucking amazing
*  i'm like one of the best sets i've seen from him and he's always been amazing but god he was on
*  fire and we were all it was me my friend owen smith and tony hinchcliffe we're sitting in the back
*  room and we were watching dave and we were in a trance we were just laughing we were letting him
*  think for us you know i'm saying like he's doing all the thinking we're just on a little ride that
*  dave's taken us on this ride and as an audience member i recognize that there's a mass hypnosis
*  there's a thing that happens where we all get into this mindset and if someone has like really well
*  crafted material like david tell and they take you on that you let them you're like weee
*  mitch hedberg's gonna take us on a ride you know what i mean you think the same thing happens
*  uh when a politician is speaking it's a good question for sure trump has a lot of elements
*  of stand-up comedy in his routines for sure 100 if you watch his most recent speech where he's
*  making fun of joe biden saying 150 million people were killed with guns and he's like i looked at
*  the first lady i mean he's literally doing stand-up who does a very good job by the way i looked at
*  the first lady i'm like where are all these bodies where are all these 150 million people that's half
*  the population like they just let him say nobody talks to him he's like uh hello idaho and like
*  you're in iowa oh like he's doing stand-up so someone took it and they made a video
*  saying donald trump at the apollo and so they put him doing this speech with audience reaction from
*  people watching stand-up comedy and laughing and a laugh track over it and it seems real it seems
*  like he's a comic so he's what about bernie bernie um for sure is a powerful speaker but i don't think
*  he's that funny i mean he'll say a funny thing every now and then right but are they the same
*  when you talk about like going along for the ride like they're doing the thinking for you such an
*  interesting idea bernie is a trustworthy person people trust him they see him up there he's not
*  polished right the thing about bernie it's like when he's saying things there's there's ums and
*  there's uhs and there's you know yeah but trump's not polished either it's a different kind of
*  polish what do you mean is a polished performer yeah like he he's like a comic doing scat you know
*  it's that that that you know it's like yeah i'm telling you that's exactly what it is it's an
*  amazing it's an amazing thing he's like filling in the blanks loading up his weapon for the next
*  line that he's going to throw and call crazy hillary lock her up like it's stand up it's
*  basically like he's doing stand up that's why biden is so fucked he's so fucked because he
*  can't talk right he has a really hard time talking he keeps screwing things up and he and it's a real
*  bad horse to bet on because he's an older guy you're still a bernie guy i love bernie right i'd love
*  the guy i love what he represents yeah like i don't know if he's going to be able to get anything
*  implemented but i love what he represents is a man who wants to do good for people that don't have
*  much that's that's a sentiment there's a there's a quality to that that i think helps us as a
*  community as a community of the united states if we have this agreement hey let's see what we can
*  do let's see what we can do to balance things out and to for the downtrodden for the people that are
*  hurting concentrate on them and he's made that a huge priority of his life and always has and to
*  deny that it's like look what he's trying to do i don't know if he can get any of this shit past
*  i don't think anybody knows until he gets in there but the idea is we're saying we want better for
*  people who don't have much yeah that's what he stands for and you can call it democratic socialism
*  but it's an idea the idea is like helping people just helping people helping people you don't even
*  know what's in the world a little bit better place for the working person what's then the
*  corollary what's the trump idea and why did it succeed a bunch of pussies out there trying to
*  ban free speech a bunch of pussies out there come on america's number one fuck yeah fuck yeah
*  there's also he doesn't talk like a politician you know he talks about china you go to them listen
*  motherfuckers when they charge you 25 percent everybody's like yeah more stand up it's more
*  stand up right it's way more entertaining he's the most entertaining forget about value judgment of
*  who he is as a person without a doubt the most entertaining president that's ever lived and not
*  even close there's not even a close second he buries all of them and he drags him into his fight even
*  hillary is now talking differently about other people she said about bernie nobody liked him
*  she would have never said that before donald trump she would have never uttered those words
*  his victory over her is deep in her dna now and she's starting to exhibit some of his patterns
*  by saying nobody ever liked him how could you say that what kind of crazy of course millions of
*  people like him they're voting for him millions millions of people to say nobody liked him or
*  nobody liked him in the sense of course of course people like him and then they started writing i
*  like bernie this hashtag i like bernie start popping up like that behavior is a direct
*  reaction to her getting pounded on by donald trump through the entire campaign all right so
*  let me ask you this you've talked to a lot of people from all different realms in here right
*  if we can agree let's say that being entertaining is not a great prerequisite for qualification for
*  being president if we can agree on that which seems pretty easy yes very easy degree on
*  what can be done whether it's in the political sphere the media sphere putting something in the
*  drinking water to let people to encourage people to have a little bit more of what you're after
*  whether it's compassion whether it's understanding whether it's balance whether it's moderation in
*  other words why is the entertainment force winning right now and if you don't like that notion what
*  can be done about it well the entertainment force is written for whatever reason is being portrayed
*  through trump only see he's not a politician he's a guy who's a media star and he's been a media star
*  for decades he knows how to manipulate the media he knows how to sit on the letterman couch and kill
*  he's been doing it for a long time he's very comfortable being in front of cameras none of
*  those people have those kind of skills and nobody thought of it as a skill they thought of a
*  politician being able to do their politician stuff when this guy's calling you crazy ted or
*  lion ted or you know lion hillary he just makes up names for you sleepy joe i mean and i'm smiling
*  because it's funny because he's good at it he's funny he's good at it here's the problem you
*  shouldn't have a goddamn popularity contest to see who controls thermonuclear weapons that's
*  fucking stupid it's stupid to allow people to vote but it's based on a popularity system we've got
*  so that's what i'm asking you is what now well this system's only a couple hundred years old
*  i know or even this is this kind of i mean the way that these elections are because i don't think
*  it was i mean if you look at linkin douglas debates those were actual debates with two people
*  it has evolved a lot but i mean let's say that you're not happy with the way it is and there's
*  a lot of people even there are people who like trump quite a bit on some dimensions who are very
*  troubled by other dimensions there's a lot of people out there who are open to like no let's
*  let's try to adjust the thinking let's try to change our minds let's try to not be influenced
*  as much by what we're being influenced by do you have any uh do you have any pointers the the real
*  problem that we're having is this tribal battle of left versus right and the the strongest voices
*  on the left the loudest voices and the most extreme oftentimes are the worst representations
*  and the same with the right the loudest most extreme team members are the people at the front
*  of the line fuck yeah we're gonna kick their ass like is that guy with me am i on this team fuck are
*  we in a war now we're in a war with the left i think that's what it is you know and um and there's
*  also these ideas that we have that are cemented in stone that you know if you're a left-wing person
*  you believe in x y and z this is your doctrine if you're right wing but most of us have like a
*  little bit of this yeah maybe you believe in the second amendment maybe you believe in the first
*  amendment maybe you think that maybe you know uh maybe we should incorporate a lot of things we do
*  with the fire department and you know and do that to schools and do that to housing and do that to
*  make sure that all the the stuff's covered make housing like a an important part of a civilization
*  like for everybody we did a piece uh for economics radio piece a year or two ago called america's
*  hidden duopoly and it was about the democratic and republican party basically acting like pepsi and
*  coke right they kind of divide and conquer the market and they've built an industry that is
*  incredibly valuable yeah the thing that's amazing to me is this uh trump won the presidency as the
*  republican that the rnc most wanted to get rid of bernie last time around was the democrat that
*  the dnc wanted to get rid of they lost by getting their candidate hillary in this time bernie who
*  may very well become the candidate is again the party that the dnc is out to get so what does it
*  say you've got a duopoly literally the machines running the system that we kind of let ourselves
*  get manipulated into buying like you said i've never understood my mom my mom and dad were
*  democrats for a long long time typical catholic okay maybe not so typical because they were former
*  jewish catholic typical catholic working class big family meat and potatoes issues no-brainer
*  that they're democrats okay and then but my mom as a devout catholic she started the local right
*  to life chapter in upstate new york where we lived new york state had legalized abortion before roe
*  v wade so she was fighting that fight early when that happened and the democrats lined up against
*  in favor of legalized abortion she switched parties everything else about her was still
*  mostly democratic but she had to become a republican because of life and that's a that's
*  another powerful one that gets integrated into the right and it happens to all of us though we take
*  there's one issue that kind of sets people off and then they have to join the team that they may uh
*  yeah you know with a lot of people i know it's the second amendment right people that are afraid of
*  their house being broken into and they don't have anything to protect their family and they'd
*  otherwise be kind of libertarianish democrats yeah and it's almost always guys who have kids
*  yeah once you have kids and you think about someone breaking into your house and and doing
*  something to your family you know you get real scared and then you want to get guns all right
*  let me ask you a slightly different question or it's actually totally different question
*  as i'm sure you know if you look at any indicator of like prosperity longevity health
*  literacy access to food etc humankind is way better off than it's ever been yes no without
*  question on average there's still a lot of people with a lot of trouble there are still parts of the
*  world that are still in bad shape and so it's trending in an amazing direction amazing direction
*  why are we so unhappy i don't think um we know how to manage our life correctly and life
*  doesn't come with a guidebook it doesn't come with when you're in this condition seek out these
*  remedies start exercising uh get together with your friends tell them you love them meet up and
*  have dinner and hug each other sleep well sleep well drink water you know there's whiskey a little
*  bit of whiskey too right and also you know so many of us have a bad head start like you're starting
*  off you know like how about your dad he'd been growing up getting kicked out of the family yeah
*  i mean and then starts a family of his own where you don't even know your grandfather i mean it's
*  madness right madness so you're you're coming out of this stressful pocket or maybe your dad goes
*  to jail or maybe your your mom dies when you're young all these things that happen to people where
*  they have this bad start right and then they develop defense mechanisms to deal with all their
*  insecurities and they get around similar minded people and you curse the world and fuck everybody
*  fuck the police and fuck the this and then you get in these communities of people that think the
*  same way and then maybe there's gangs and maybe there's drugs and maybe there's crime and despair
*  and sadness and maybe just negative people maybe there's none of the above maybe there's no
*  danger it's just fucking annoying every day people complaining about shit and you're stuck in the mud
*  of humanity with people it's real hard to engineer 350 million people out of that but for yourself
*  you can take actions to make your life better and if everybody did that if everybody took actions
*  to make their life a happier experience by doing those things by exercising eating well hugging
*  friends in an enhancing community just trying to be nicer to people everybody did that would be a
*  massive shift so let me ask you this i feel like the list you just gave is basically my list too
*  right i try that's what i try to do pretty much um and they all sound attractive yes so why is it
*  so hard for so many people to do it because people are lazy and the reason why we're lazy is because
*  it's very difficult for us to waste resources on something that we don't currently do and even though
*  we know something to be true that if you do this physical long-term benefits yeah we know that but
*  short terms like i don't want to do it right now right because your body like craves relaxation
*  because it used to be a very rare thing to achieve all right so if you could pick one thing let's
*  say let's say i'm a person why would i pick one thing well the first thing let's say the first
*  thing let's say let's say that i feel like you know what society says everything's great i'm unhappy
*  financially okay why is exercise the one because you're blood pumping right release natural
*  endorphins and you legitimately feel better and i also think of the i think about this all the time
*  i think of your body as almost like the energy in your body is like a battery and it requires
*  a certain amount of use and when you don't use it it overflows and then you get weird behavior and
*  overreacting to things and you almost like get antsy you got to get up and move cognitively it's
*  a big i find what do you do with let's say you have to take two long flights let's say you're
*  unable to exercise for like you know 24 36 hours you're fine you don't have no i mean you you don't
*  know really days off yeah yeah that's fine it's fine the whole key is just to develop regular
*  habits if you have to take two or three days off it doesn't matter the whole key is just regular
*  habits what's your sleep uh regime well i have a whoop and my oh yeah tells me every night how
*  much i sleep yeah and has it improved you has the feedback improved your sleep because it made me
*  accountable yeah like i was like i get like seven eight hours every night i was getting like four
*  and five and i was like oh you lying bitch so it made me it made me concentrate more on getting
*  what do you do to sleep better or sleep well it's just a matter of time it's a matter when
*  did you change like do you sleep with earplugs eye mask anything like that i don't have a problem
*  sleeping okay i sleep well you just problem is doing things and waking up early and i realize
*  like okay if i'm gonna wake up that early i gotta go to bed early yeah i really need to you're not
*  a napper no i don't nap how come um i just never enjoy it really yeah you never tried it no i have
*  no but doesn't work uh like when i'm done i'm done do you drink caffeine yes have you ever tried the
*  caffeine nap do you know about that yes yes yeah i know what it is so you but that's not my problem
*  all right my problem is uh when i'm off when i shut down i shut down so 20 minute nap becomes
*  eight hours i'm not interested i got you i'll be laying down for hours i don't mean to criticize
*  your productivity you're plenty productive plainly but there's a balance there's a balance between
*  being productive and being happy right and i think it's hard to find that balance because we look at
*  like the the numbers that come in whether it's money or productivity or you know the number of
*  things you've been able to create and you think of that as being like but look i can get so much
*  done but if you maybe got less of those numbers but more of the numbers in terms of the amount
*  of sleep you got you would enjoy the whole overall experience more i worry that uh i think for a lot
*  of people who are successful in different realms could be sports business entertainment whatever
*  success is intoxicating yes and then you want more of it right and then it becomes very easy to see
*  that as the main goal at the expense of loved ones other people i'm looking for uh i'd like to know
*  how and i know some people do manage that really well and i know some incredibly successful people
*  are incredibly generous in spirit to people around them but i find that's pretty rare i find that
*  success often is driven by a sort of ambition that's a little bit unseemly and i'd like to
*  know how to deal with that a little bit better well it doesn't have to be but it seems like it
*  would be if it's a number game right if success meaning like you're in a business you're trying
*  to sell the most placards or whatever like whatever it is you know you have this thing
*  in your head and like you're really driven i just say if you're selling placards you're already
*  starting behind okay widgets all right you're selling the most widgets and you you have this
*  goal in your mind of being number one and you're obsessed and you know and everyone's going to tell
*  your story well bob he wouldn't let it go every time i got there he was in the office and he left
*  after everybody but look now bob's got a fucking yacht and he's also got a pacemaker right bob's
*  ready to tick over any minute now but also i think the thing is in pursuit of success
*  i think what often happens that i've seen in people i know and in people i don't know but i've read
*  about is that your moral compass starts to shift and you're willing to it's not necessarily true
*  there's a lot of people that are successful and we're only talking about business right we're not
*  talking about athletics are we i'm talking i'm thinking of some people in academia who uh you
*  know even though the average person may not consider the stakes in academia super high but
*  like if you get in a big university department and you start to write papers and get published
*  and then get grants and accolades and so on you're on a trajectory that's very intoxicating and then
*  all of a sudden i think it's uh it's more i think it's tempting or not even tempting i don't think
*  it's even a conscious decision you start to make decisions that are not as sound not as morally
*  acceptable as you would have made five years ago when you were starting out and i don't like i see
*  that happening a lot i see it in media i see people cutting corners i see it in business um
*  well the academia i don't have any experience with but i i would imagine that that would be
*  particularly frustrating because those are the people that you call upon to be the objective
*  purveyors of knowledge these are the people that are talking to you about this because
*  they're dedicated to being intellectual exactly you don't think of them as being a social
*  timer how strange is this though how strange is it that we talk about economists for just for one
*  example but it's a good example because they're the most involved in policy and so on there are
*  democratic economists and there are republican economists you know that shouldn't make sense
*  right right but it does there's a list that when you're if you're a republican and you win the
*  white house and you start to assemble your council of economic advisors you get the list
*  of the republican or the conservative economists now i'm not saying that's a terrible thing prima
*  you know per se but the fact is is that like we said before if you're in the tribe
*  if you're for one thing you got to be in for everything and that's not a good way so much of
*  what goes on between the two parties ultimately in a lot of the cases that we've experienced have
*  been about perception like there's a difference between the perceived actions of barack obama
*  versus the perceived actions of george bush like even though like things that would freak people
*  out about bush people didn't really seem to budge on with obama like drone attacks right like a lot
*  of people killed in drones attacks that were innocent and you know that happened during the
*  bush administration and happened during the obama but people particularly on the left treated the
*  bush administration's drone attacks very differently than they treated when obama was doing it they
*  seemed to like let it go because it didn't fit with their narrative of the evil you know military
*  industrial complex influenced president who only gives a fuck about money it didn't didn't seem to
*  jive with that so they let it go and they because it's a a team thing they were they were rooting
*  for their team to be good so they listen my team's made some fucking slips up this year but i'm with
*  the yankees all the way it's basically what you're doing you're just doing it for the democrat
*  exactly yeah if you're if you're watching a football game let's say you're watching a football
*  game in a bar and you're with let's say i'm a steelers fan since i'm watching with steelers fan
*  we're playing whoever ravens the minute there's a call let's say a pass interference call the room
*  divides equally because one side knows that it's a bad call and the other side knows that and these
*  are people who if you took them out out of a football context they're totally going to have
*  different feel they're not going to experience everything the same way and even if it's a bad
*  call as long as it's for your team you're going to take it yeah we got it and once in a while if
*  it's such a bad call you say oh we got we got lucky there but almost never it's amazing how
*  fun in it right the tribal fun i agree and that's why sports again it's it's like a low stakes
*  you know replica of life and war and all that stuff relatively so i'm i'm totally in favor of
*  that i am but i think it does show how kind of uh you know suggestible we all are super suggestible
*  and sells how strange it is that you could make this format like football you know a ball across
*  the line represents a victory right and we've decided to like make huge amounts of money attached
*  to this this game and then fill up the biggest arenas we have we have enormous 50 000 plus arenas
*  of people cheering when a ball goes across the line there was uh this story i read about some
*  rabbi in europe 100 200 300 years ago something and uh he wanted his students uh at this yeshiva
*  to just study more and when they would have a break they would always want to go outside and
*  play football soccer and they called football and he would say to them you know i don't understand
*  the treasures of torah are so huge they're eternal why do you want to go out and kick around a ball
*  and they said no no you don't understand rabbi it is so much fun it's got a little competitive
*  we get it's just great he said they said you know just come outside and watch it once and we think
*  you'll see how it works and how great it is so this old rabbi comes out once at lunchtime and
*  he's watching the two teams with the ball going back and forth they come back in after lunch and
*  he says i think i've solved the problem for you if you get two balls instead of one you won't have
*  to be fighting each other all the time over the one ball everybody could be happy so you know
*  different ways of looking at the world yeah for sure yeah if everyone could look at the world that
*  way the world would be a better place yeah it's um i mean it's sports are for whatever reason the
*  best escape for a lot of people because it's it's exciting and unpredictable and it's really
*  happening whereas a movie even though it's an escape you know it's not really happening
*  agree right you watch a sport man if a guy can make a fucking three-pointer at the buzzer and
*  it wins the game and everybody goes nuts that shit's real like yes we fucking did it you turn
*  to your friends everybody's so excited hey no wonder so this is the universal symbol for yes
*  right but here's the one that also gets me the universal symbol for something great almost
*  happened and it didn't is this oh hands on the forehead everybody around the world where does
*  that come from in the human what kind of where in the code dictated that that's how we're going to
*  express but everywhere around the world that's what they do that's a really good question yeah i
*  don't have an answer unfortunately i don't know is it like my brain right yeah it must be like
*  it's together my head's still here what's your favorite sport to watch um i like fighting
*  because i do commentary for the ufc i find them the rest of the sports to be boring i don't really
*  watch other sports do you like fighting because of the tactics because of the action etc or is
*  it because the personality primarily um the excitement that comes from being insanely difficult
*  uh it's the way i describe it sorry if everybody's heard this a million times it's high level
*  problem solving with dire physical consequences so you know that they're on this this crazy path
*  where one guy's trying to slam a shin into the other guy's face and the other guy's trying to
*  do the same they're trying to take each other down choke each other and and to lose is horrible and
*  to win is glorious and everybody's cheering and then you know when it all plays out live the rush
*  of of these guys that these guys experience and then the rush that the audience experiences
*  it's hard for me to watch like tennis i don't care where that ball goes i get it i get it it's very
*  athletic i'm not there's no knock on the athletes yeah and again i like playing pool so i've watched
*  a lot of dumb shit i watch pool on youtube every day yeah so um so let me ask you this uh ufc let's
*  say is uh i mean it's doing pretty well it's not it's not the bonanza it looked like it might be
*  a couple years ago right business-wise the league right better than ever is it yeah is that right
*  yeah so the athletes themselves um i know the superstars do great um what about the rest of
*  them is it a steep pyramid and is it it's a less if you're in the middle it's a less steep pyramid
*  than boxing okay boxing when you see the undercards of fights like if you see a fight like uh manny
*  pacquiao floyd mayweather's biggest boxing pay-per-view fight ever a huge fight right millions
*  and millions and millions of dollars the guys further down the bottom of the chain they're
*  getting an awesome opportunity to fight in front of the crowd that's going to see manny pacquiao
*  versus floyd mayweather they don't make much money and that's the case in boxing overwhelmingly
*  in the early stages of a person's career it's the same as mma and then as they become famous they
*  start making more the difference is there's a floyd mayweather and the closest thing we have
*  to that is a conor mcgregor and maybe ronda rousey floyd mayweather when you people talk about money
*  in boxing you're talking about floyd mayweather i mean maybe you were talking about tyson at one
*  point in time and ali before him and sugary lennard the guys who made the big money roy jones jr
*  but there's only a couple of those guys ever even in boxing it's the same thing with mma there's
*  a couple guys like conor mcgregor or you know a few superstars and once you get beyond them once
*  you get to number 100 let's say well then you're trying to become number one it's not a thing that
*  you're going to have any sort of security doing right do you like that so that's what economists
*  call a tournament model right which is where a lot of people are willing to enter it because the
*  winning is so high but you know that you're not going to make anything unless you advance a whole
*  lot would you rather see mma like that or would you rather it seem more like would you rather see it
*  more like the team sports where you're at least guaranteed you're on a salary right so nfl if
*  you're the 53rd guy on the roster you're not making a ton of money but you know you're going
*  to make money as long as you don't get hurt would you rather see mma a little bit more like that
*  would you rather see the the fighters have more of a league and have more leverage or do you like
*  the way it's set up now fighters are always going to be individuals it's very difficult to get a
*  fighter in a union that's why it's never been done although the pga tour is basically the union for
*  the gulf they did that that's what the golfers did and tennis is a little bit different but anyway
*  i mean couldn't they do it if well now ufc has too much leverage i think for that to happen right
*  even if they didn't it would be very difficult to get fighters to not jump in and take a fight
*  because opportunities are rare and when a fight comes along if you say look i'm going to offer you
*  fight conor mcgregor for x amount of money and you're like i want more they're like look this
*  guy's standing right right and that's always going to be that case until you're conor mcgregor yeah
*  and that's the business model that's always been the business model in boxing but in ufc it's
*  different and ufc is controlled by one company so they can force big fights whereas there's a lot
*  of big fights in boxing so this is their justification for the structure that they have those big fights in
*  boxing didn't occur and it frustrated the fans and the reason why it didn't occur was multiple
*  promoters well under one banner you have one promotion that has the most fighters and the ones
*  who and the best presumably and the ones who are the most popular make the most money the question is
*  should the guys at the bottom make more i think they should and i've always thought that because
*  i think it's a very very very difficult thing and i think we should be trying to give them
*  enough money so that they can do their best and we can see the best fighters come up i think
*  one of the impediments of guys coming up is that in the beginning you have to work a full-time job
*  as well as fight and it's really hard to train it's hard to make that leap and if we get someone we
*  can sign it i agree with you this should be like some sort of a minimum and that minimum would we
*  would agree upon something that would be sustainable if you're fighting say once or twice a year on the
*  other hand but twice a year at least okay especially in the beginning you'd fight you'd probably fight
*  as many times as you can in the beginning you'd fight three times a year if you could four even
*  and guys like donald serrano even at the top still fights like four or five times a year just because
*  he's a wild man so theoretically like if you're looking at at a supply and demand it seems that
*  there's a lot of supply of fighters right it seems like there's a lot of audience demand but what ufc
*  is doing is according to you kind of smartly constraining the supply so that the quality is
*  high yes if you were to come in let's say you or 10 other people were to come in with alternate
*  leagues to ufc right now and take you know after ufc as whatever let's say there's a hundred very
*  good fighters right now or 50 i have no idea but let's say you take the next 200 and make those
*  other leagues are you saying that would basically be what happened to boxing and then end up well
*  people are doing that i don't know if you know but there's multiple organizations that actually
*  are doing that there's one called bellator that's huge on the paramount network it's enormous
*  and it's the biggest rival to the ufc in america but still pales in comparison but there's world
*  class fighters there and they're starting to get people from the ufc that they get their contract
*  up and they're still in their prime and then bellator comes with a better more attractive
*  offer and they take that offer also in bellator they're allowed to have sponsors the ufc is solely
*  sponsored by rebox so the fighters all have one sponsor that they wear the rebox gear and do the
*  athletes get a share yes they get they get a share i don't know how it's structured but in the but i
*  know that the fighters prefer the bellator model which is they can find their own sponsors and if
*  they have a good management company the management can get three or four sponsors on their shorts
*  and they might make more money from sponsors than they do from the fight itself which is what was in
*  the ufc so a lot of fighters were really bummed out when they switched over to a different business
*  model so that i think would probably be better for fighters but then here's another thing those
*  fighters have to enforce that they have to chase those down chase those sponsors down a lot of them
*  go bad on you and a lot of them don't pay and there was a real problem with that with fighters
*  where you know they had gotten fucked over by a couple different sponsors and it created a hassle
*  and so so then you have fighters who didn't get paid but the sponsor did get put on ufc oh boy and
*  yeah so is the ufc responsible like who who's responsible for that and it turns out it's the
*  fighters that are responsible but that's a fucking giant burden on them while they're in the middle
*  of training to try to go sue some you know fight gear company that didn't pay them their money
*  i don't think it's a justification for not giving them the freedom to choose their own sponsors
*  i think a better scenario would probably be have one sponsor available that you you know like
*  everyone couldn't choose this sponsor or a competing sponsor you know like maybe something
*  else so like you could have a re-bought guy that's fighting against a guy who's like some motor oil
*  companies sponsoring them it's like making it mandatory it takes some of the power away from
*  fighters for negotiation so forgive my ignorance but getting back to just the actual fighting uh
*  two fights a year sounds kind of like standard three is kind of a lot four is a whole lot why
*  it's hard but i mean like i've seen fighting a little i've obviously i mean you look at me
*  you can tell i've never done it myself you get busy um but uh i mean like the nfl is hard
*  right and they're playing 16 games a year plus pre-season practice and why why is it how how can
*  it be that hard that you can only do it a few times these are adorable questions because it's
*  this sport of hurting people yeah football hurting people is an accidental occurrence
*  no that's not true not if you're playing on the line yeah but they're colliding into each other
*  but they're not doing something specifically to knock you unconscious or break your liver
*  all right there's techniques that you're doing that are trying to fuck a guy's knee up i understand
*  that but is it that you need three four five six months between to literally recuperate from the
*  pain even if you win is that what it's about not just pain it's punishment there's guys that their
*  leg it takes randy couture um he fought this guy named Pedro his oh Pedro his oh is this Brazilian
*  kickboxer that had the most devastating leg kicks maybe in the history of the sport he would slam
*  his shin into people's legs and you could see them like visibly hobbled by it and randy's leg was so
*  fucked up from their first fight that he had to wait six months before he was fully recovered
*  six months just from a guy kicking his leg slamming his shin into the thigh his legs were just
*  chopped meat they were just destroyed all the the tissue was broken up there was blood inflamed
*  his legs were swollen up i mean it's horrific i have to say you're reinforcing the uh validity
*  of my decision to become a writer yeah it's not a fighter yeah it's a long career it's exciting
*  but not too exciting so why okay so i don't mean to sound even more naive than i've sounded now but
*  like why why is that why do you choose the life of a fighter if it's that punishing well they do
*  this is initially they do it for self-improvement okay you get involved for self-improvement they
*  want to learn how to defend themselves maybe they want to learn some self-confidence then they get
*  excited about improving and they get better at it and then they achieve a level of expertise that
*  makes them the person in the gym that is above the other new people that come in and then you get to
*  experience what it's like to be an assassin you get to strangle people all the time and then you
*  get to a point where you're like i want to test myself and then you say i'm just going to take an
*  amateur fight so then you take an amateur fight and then you go you know what i think i can do
*  this for a living and then you think about being stuck in some fucking cubicle selling insurance or
*  maybe making connor mcgregor money maybe i can get to the poor i know how to talk shit i think i
*  can hurt people i think i get in there and make some money and i don't have to fight three or four
*  times a year i don't have a fucking boss no one tells me what to do i can talk shit and i can go
*  out there and just do something that i really enjoy doing martial arts and just continue to be
*  as good as i can to be a professional athlete it's attractive to especially to risk seeking
*  young males or females that totally makes sense but let's say it's you let's say you're 21 years
*  old you and you have the ability to do that right you're discovering that you have the ability to
*  do that and then if you could project that decision forward let's say 30 years and say okay i'm going
*  to go for this and i'm gonna and i'm going to factor in the probability that i'm actually
*  going to make really good money or have an amazing life-changing or life-affirming experience for
*  10 years and then get out and do something else versus do that insurance cubicle job in other
*  words you know it's kind of the short the high probability high risk bet versus the longer steady
*  one where you might have more of a center of gravity to have a family etc which would you
*  choose and why well first of all why would only have two choices that seems ridiculous because
*  i'm only giving you two right now that's fine i used to fight i stopped fighting when i was 21
*  because of i was worried about head injuries right it was too dangerous and when i was doing it there
*  was no money there wasn't a ufc there if if you were making that decision now though with the money
*  now do you think the decision would be different there was no ufc then so there was no choice but
*  take 21 year old joe yes i would have fought for sure 100 right i definitely would have i was
*  excited by it right it was it was scary i was terrified but i also knew that i could get good
*  at it and then while i was getting good at it it's it's a wild rush it's a wild crazy rush
*  because it's so dangerous to do and the risk seeking those kind of people that are risk seekers
*  the ones that do rock climbing and bmx bike running and base jumping that's a type of person
*  there's whatever for whatever reason that's a type of person and they gravitate towards those fights
*  and they gravitate towards martial arts and some of them are the nicest people i've ever met in my
*  life they're some of the nicest kindest most interesting introspective people deep thinking
*  people people that that read a lot they can talk to you about things that can be honest and personal
*  about things they have a really good control of their ego because they're getting trounced in
*  training all the time everyone's getting humbled all the time but you you're you're on the path
*  of of a professional fighter and it's a it's a very dangerous path and so there's an incredible
*  camaraderie between the people that do it so there's they they understand that very few people
*  have the stones to do something like this or the the nuts the or the you know the chaos in your
*  brain or the insanity that lets you risk your life like this versus take that cubicle job
*  what's the damage insanely attractive what's the long-term health complications from mma do we know
*  a lot about it yet i mean we're learning a lot about football as any combat sport
*  football is like a car accident these two giant dudes are slamming into each other and
*  i tend to think that there's some impacts that i've seen in football that's not
*  recreatable in an mma ring because you don't have momentum you're not yeah you're not running at
*  each other but that said there's plenty i mean i've seen dudes get kicked into oblivion and women
*  get kicked unconscious multiple times in one event and i've worked i don't know how many events i've
*  called more than i would have to say like 1500 professional fights like easily somewhere in that
*  neighborhood definitely more than a thousand definitely without question that's being real
*  super conservative so out of those you know how many people have had like legitimate brain damage
*  because of fights a lot of them yeah they know going in there that there's going to be a risk
*  and they got to know when to get out and sometimes they don't and sometimes friends and family have
*  to intervene and it's a scary thing to watch someone slide down that road when you know oh
*  my god he's chinny which means you can't take a punch anymore which means you're starting to
*  develop some severe damage from all the sparring and the fighting and you got to know when to stop
*  and if and some people can stop and they're fine and they're they can live a long healthy life as
*  long as they stop in time yeah similar to boxing very similar in that way in that very similar um
*  very similar yeah um i think maybe boxing has a little bit more damage because all you're doing
*  is punching you're not kicking the legs you're not taking each other down you're not choking
*  each other so the the accumulation yeah the accumulation of blows to your head might you
*  might be able to argue that they get more but but then there's a guy like floyd mayweather who doesn't
*  get hit at all yeah he's so good at not being hit he's probably been hit less in his entire
*  boxing career of 50 victories and zero defeats than most mma fighters in like in their entire
*  light like tenfold yeah they get hit 10 times more than him easily so imagine that uh i came
*  down from mars and i look at you know human civilization i think you know this makes sense
*  this makes sense this makes sense this one doesn't make any sense fights well i was going to use
*  fights as an example yeah what about the coliseum i mean it's always been a part of humans right
*  we we've been interested in people beating the shit out of each other since the beginning of time
*  yeah because it scares us so it's entertaining to watch other people do it that's why we want
*  to watch a bar fight i don't want to be in a bar fight you know a lot of you don't want to be in
*  a bar fight right but if you saw a bar fight you'd be like what the fuck is this really happening
*  so a lot of the people who have turned against football the last let's say five or ten years
*  fueled by cte which is obviously a legitimate thing we don't really know the magnitude and
*  the scope yet but a lot of people who've turned against it do it for a kind of moral argument that
*  i don't want to support an endeavor where people are hurting each other period right how do you
*  feel about that i mean should there's a libertarian argument to say what are you talking about people
*  can do whatever they want they can do drugs they can uh go bungee jumping they can work uh stock
*  trading which is stressful you know can you can do whatever you want so where do you lie on that
*  well i think first of all they're right and you are doing something that's definitely going to
*  harm you however i feel like if you want to do something that you enjoy doing that's going to
*  take some time out of your life that's finite anyway who the fuck am i to tell you you can't
*  do that right am i going to tell where am i going to draw the line am i going to say no gymnastics
*  yeah like where am i going to draw the line you know didn't know soccer causes tremendous amount
*  of cte do you know that yeah lacrosse lacrosse is a lot of subconcussive trauma just heading the ball
*  causes a lot of ct i know a lot of youth leagues now are starting to cut out head yeah which i think
*  is probably a pretty good idea it's a very good idea they should probably eliminate it totally
*  often it's not the ball it's the collision with the guy in here often yeah but they think heading
*  has a huge impact no no what i'm saying when you're going up for headers you're often you're
*  knocking heads you're not going to shoulder into a head and elbow and you're running around on a
*  field and full clip you're going to collide with each other where do you stand on uh paying for
*  organs but but let's keep going with this because we didn't even touch the surface of this i'm in
*  favor of people doing what they want to do with their life if you choose to do something in your
*  life are we going to take away race car driving because that's one of the scariest goddamn things
*  a person can do not as much anymore oh it's not because they made no yeah but you know what
*  this guy's getting fucked up did you see that recent crash i did but the fact that we remember
*  that so well one reason is because there have been so few since earnhardt died back in whatever that
*  was uh 2000 listen i had dale earnhardt jr on this podcast and he want in depth about brain
*  damage that he's gotten from multiple crashes he talked about the severe impact of the concussions
*  he talked about the difficulty coming back and the different modalities of different medical
*  treatments that he's had to have like that's dale rnr jr this is after his dad is gone right
*  this guy talked like really extensively on this podcast about his personal struggle with brain
*  damage that he's received from car accidents yeah it's a fucking scary way to make a living
*  arguably more scary than fighting because there are guys like mighty mouse demetrius mighty
*  mouse johnson who's like this elite mma fighter that barely gets touched there's guys like him
*  that don't take any damage and then there's guys who are elite nascar drivers who wind up in these
*  crazy collisions and go sent through the air and they wind up in the hospital all fucked up the
*  impact just the impact even if you're in a cage just your brain rattling around inside your head
*  fucks you up and we're letting people do that and i don't think we should stop i think we should let
*  people do whatever they want if they want to do they want to take a tightrope walk across the grand
*  canyon and film it on youtube i can't i'm not the guy unless it's over private land or public land
*  there's a law against using it who who are we to tell people they can't rock climb who are we to
*  tell people they can't ski where do we draw the line yeah where do you decide a person can't do
*  a thing i don't know you make a good argument i don't think there's a bad argument with what
*  you're saying though and saying that it's it causes damage to people you're right by the way
*  i'm a i love the nfl i would cry if it went away on the other hand uh and i and i know a few nfl
*  will now former nfl players uh one of whom stopped playing in his fifth year way earlier than he had
*  to because he was worried about cte but also he was getting a phd in math from mit at the same time
*  so he had a plan he had an alternative but then there's another guy combination he's in a you would
*  you would you should have him on your show john urschel his name is urs chel okay we'll talk about
*  fascinating guy um there's another guy dominique foxworth uh both these guys happen to play for
*  the ravens which happens to be the team i hate most but i've gotten to be friendly with them
*  dominique foxworth uh had a great money-making career because he kind of got his big contract
*  in his whatever fourth fifth year well took out insurance on it then got hurt and and really never
*  played again so he banked enough money after that he went and got an mba from harvard because he's
*  a bright and interesting and ambitious guy he will never let his son play football it's like you hear
*  these stories about the guys who've done it who've made a life you know out of it and it just really
*  makes me think about uh you're right everybody should have the right to do anything for their
*  own livelihood or or for their own excitement right on the other hand like if we had the coliseum
*  today per se like what we have is a modern version of the coliseum if we had the coliseum per se
*  fighting the tigers slaves getting thrown into fight the tigers we don't like that it's like
*  the line things are repugnant until they're not and it's hard to predict where that line is a lot
*  of things that used to be not repugnant slavery fine the whole world if you had the ability to do
*  it right and then get go straight back to the coliseum it's the same thing it's like we have a
*  line and whatever the cultural line is especially depending upon how many people die around us
*  how much plague and murder and how much you know how much you're dealing with war that line moves
*  yeah yeah right now people find it repugnant to use a plastic shopping bag that was how good
*  and that's a dangerous argument if if it's not a good decision right because if you can feel like
*  oh we stopped using plastic shopping bags therefore this is called moral licensing
*  i i licensed my because i've made one good moral decision now i can license myself to
*  do other stuff so i can read on paper right like if you had to bring every time you go to the
*  supermarket you have to bring a reusable bag right it's great on paper until you don't have a
*  reusable bag and so then you have to buy a paper bag and then it rains then your groceries fall
*  in the street i mean that's the extreme no but these are i mean the problem is plastic bags if
*  you look at the menace to the environment overall plastic bags are a pretty pretty small part the
*  danger is when people feel that they've contributed by doing something small and then stop thinking
*  about bigger better things to do that's it's interesting too that we just accept an inevitable
*  amount of litter yeah it's not because it's really a garbage disposal issue yeah right it's true if
*  we had a zero is it i know it's it's interesting because sometimes sometimes there's accidents
*  right things fall off things things blow down the street you can't get to them but there's a lot of
*  the a lot of it is just assholishness you know i agree i happen to play golf which i'm a little
*  embarrassed about because i dare you i know i grew up as the kind of person that looked at golfers
*  like that's not my club when did you start like eight ten years ago i love it i absolutely love
*  it it's also nice because you're outdoors for a long time you're often alone for a long time and
*  another thing i really like about it is i get to be around other people often men in a way that you
*  don't get to be around other men in that way you know what i mean it's like um it's it's good for
*  the it's good for the soul in a in a way and i just like the competition it's a really hard
*  game so i like trying to get better at it but um the thing that amazes me is how much crap there
*  is uh how much garbage there is on a golf course i'm like thinking it'll blow out of your bag and
*  i'm just like i don't know i like nature a lot i don't like the idea of like candy wrappers all
*  over so then i write i extrapolate and think bigger like you do plastic bags should it be
*  that hard to take it home use it maybe once or twice again and then throw it away and i understand
*  that they're less you know recyclable but you know we have a lot of landfill space but even landfill
*  space that's where a lot of it goes you've seen landfill space with things are flying around the
*  wind it's just like god damn it we it's hard to contain all of our garbage we produce so much crap
*  it's true although much less per person weight weight wise than we did 50 100 years ago that's
*  mostly because garbage used to be heavier well you know we wouldn't create technological improvements
*  that are difficult to see while you're in the moment like if you go back and look at photos
*  of los angeles in the 60s and you see the the pollution it was insane it was literally like
*  there was a fire yeah right and now it's gotten a lot better it still sucks but it's gotten a lot
*  question would it have gotten a lot better without let's say regulation yeah what industry have done
*  it on its own no chance no they would have accepted it clean air act which president
*  i don't nixon oh wow that's crazy go to mexico go to mexico city wild yeah like we're flying in i was
*  like holy shit that's real like crazy pollution yeah i took photos of him put it on instagram
*  like this is wild yeah have you been to china no never been china bring your air bring your face
*  i'm sure yeah no i've seen videos it's um i'm hoping the technology catches up to our pollution
*  at the same time we're remedying our situation by trying to be better with recycling but i'm
*  hoping that someone figures out some giant building size filter some huge thing they put in the middle
*  of every city and it sucks all the carbon it just seems like in the particulates there are so
*  particulate pollution has gotten so much better in fact one wrinkle of uh climate change and
*  global warming is that the particulates the soot in the atmosphere in the 60 50 60s and 70s was
*  apparently what kept things a little bit cooler because it refracted sunlight and heat right
*  that's so so the irony is you clean up the air and you allow more global warming yeah exactly anyway
*  global warming is a very complicated issue yeah this is another example where when people reduce
*  it to the headlines and then divide people into tribes it's exactly the opposite of what you want
*  perfect example because it's clearly a right versus left thing too in some people's circles
*  if you're on the right you're supposed to say it's exaggerated it's a hoax it's this it's that's not
*  my concern my concern is jobs my concern is that like you repeat the talking points and if it's on
*  the left it's how dare you yeah it's gretta thurmburg i think the biggest uh that was a that
*  was not the best credit to you that was actually now that i know it's her it was not a bad imitation
*  i think one of obama's biggest mistakes he plainly wanted to address climate change global warming
*  but he did it in a kind of standard left uh democrat way by calling it global warming by
*  saying that there were bad actors which is true the thing that's astonishes me that democrats
*  haven't done is talk about it in a language that every republican every conservative every hunter
*  fisher would respond to which is pollution which is what it is by the way right right why why it
*  became a conversation about a much bigger much more abstract much more difficult to understand
*  an acton problem is strange to me because um you know humankind is a very very very very
*  important part of the world of climate change and it's very very important to me because um you know
*  humankind comes together we came to look polio vaccine it wasn't like everybody was working on
*  it but there were enough people concerned about it and then you had a president who said hey march
*  of dimes let's have everybody raise money come up with a vaccine and then interestingly you know
*  sulk with the vaccine this is just interesting about the way medicine works today he basically
*  you know this was this is was this is the way we've have thought in our past as humans about
*  solving big problems we seem to have gotten away from that a little bit and i think that's where to
*  me the tribalism is the most dangerous it's not about the political charades i don't care about
*  that i don't think that's particularly damaging where i think it's damaging is by dividing yourself
*  into these tribes that are so exclusive and they have these purity tests what we're doing is we're
*  actually diminishing our collective ability to come together to solve problems the good news is
*  there's a million people out there at academic institutions in garages groups of one and two
*  people who are working on solutions that are that keep coming you know human humans a cool species
*  is what i'm trying to say yeah we really are yeah yeah and i think it's interesting but jonas salk
*  when he did create that vaccine the world was a different place and there wasn't this pharmaceutical
*  industry that we have today that's you know has such a strong ability to influence the way people
*  look at things through advertisements and just through the way they influence politicians where
*  is it's a different world so to compare the bounty that was awaiting jonas salk for coming
*  up with the polio vaccine it's just a different world true the world's different didn't he like
*  wasn't there some controversy that he didn't give credit to the other people that helped him with
*  the vaccine yes there was and i don't i so he's okay with money but not good with uh giving people
*  credit i haven't read this in a long time so i can't i can't speak to it but but even like
*  i've been um do you like richard feinman you know richard feinman so so you know when he talks about
*  i love hearing him talk about uh when he was drafted to work on the manhattan project and you
*  think about it america was it was an existential fear yes legitimate right sure i mean we wound up
*  using it we did use it on us we did indeed yes and uh and when you hear feinman talk about all the
*  complication of that we have an enormous scientific challenge we have an enormous competition against
*  the the germans who are trying to do the same thing and then even if we win then we have another
*  whole challenge which is the moral challenge yeah but but there's a way of thinking about those
*  things and again measuring the costs and benefits that people who might disagree aggressively and
*  they did about the manhattan project can sit down and say okay here's here's what we're going to do
*  what's what's the lesser of the two evils and i feel like right now i don't know it's a
*  much progress as we've had i feel we've gotten worse at looking at the lesser of two evil paths
*  that looking at weighing costs and benefits well what is the lesser of two evils in that regard is
*  it drop the bombs and stop the war or is the lesser of two evils never drop the bomb and stop
*  the war later yeah i mean look um there's a million books been written about this um
*  um i could make an argument in in either case i mean japan we were very very scared of japan
*  japan had shown a lot of um ability to punish the united states um even though germany was out uh
*  america still felt very fragile so i totally get the argument that it was meant to be uh you know
*  i get it too yeah on the other hand um you're picking some pretty big cities to drop it on
*  and you're picking two so you know you're killing mostly civilians yeah yeah so it's hard to imagine
*  that decision would be made today but as you just said about you know polio vaccine different
*  different case but roughly same time you're out you know it's very hard to project your morals
*  onto uh you know 50 years from now we may have a very different view about mma for instance it's
*  very hard to project it well that i think that's far more intense and extreme than mma and we're
*  talking about nuking people literally out of existence but i think that just the fact that
*  these brilliant scientists were forced into that moral dilemma like one of my favorite videos
*  online is opennheimer when he's discussing what he said when the first atomic bomb was detonated
*  and he quoted the bhagavad gita and he said i am become death destroyer of worlds and it's just to
*  say that to see have you seen it the video oh please let me let me play this for you play play
*  opennheimer right after describing what it was like because it's so eerie because here you have
*  one of the most brilliant scientists ever who completed this fantastic project yeah the manhattan
*  project created bombs that literally were nuclear weapons never happened before in all of human
*  history as far as we know and here the guy that did it that knew that knew that that was going to
*  be the death of untold amounts of people listen to this listen to what he says the world would not be
*  the same few people laughed few people cried most people were silent
*  i remembered the line from the hindu scripture the bhagavad gita
*  vishnu
*  is trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed
*  form and says now i am become death the destroyer of worlds i suppose we all thought that
*  one way or another dude imagine being that guy i mean here's a guy first of all was quoting the
*  bhagavad gita in 1945 a little ahead of his time pretty incredible or 40 was 46 when did they when
*  did they first detonate 40 uh the tests were i think 44 and hiroshima and nagasaki 45 correct
*  somewhere in that range and being this guy who you know he's just a brilliant scientist he's
*  not supposed to be the guy who destroys a half a million people in one moment one brief flash of
*  light and vaporizes a half a million people he um he went to the school in new york city called the
*  ethical culture fieldston school which is where my kids went so oppenheimer is kind of a patron saint
*  for having the brains to do something almost unimaginable and having the ethics encouraged
*  to know that what he'd done was unacceptable on some levels um you know on the other hand but look
*  if we're talking about costs and benefits let's think about nuclear power nuclear bombs as a
*  deterrent against others down the road right so you have to say killed a lot of people how many
*  lives did it save impossible to say you sound like a republican sir i know i know but i mean
*  argument right then you also have to talk about then let's also talk about nuclear power which
*  was the byproduct of this right and there are those who could argue and i would probably
*  uh aid this argument to say that if the u.s. had continued on the path of nuclear power in the
*  70s rather than totally flipping out after well after three mile island then later chernobyl which
*  was a much worse action than three mile island if if that had continued what we'd have now is probably
*  much much much um cleaner cheaper safer nuclear fuel and instead what happened because we basically
*  stopped building nuclear plants instead for the next 40 years we burnt a crap load of coal
*  that's been terrible for the environment for lives a lot of lives lost in mining coal but then the
*  pollution so on so you know actions have consequences what seems to be all benefit often has a lot of
*  costs and life is complicated but i think the more that we can measure and weigh things sensibly
*  the less screaming there is i i just you know i love changing my mind i love hearing somebody
*  make an argument that makes me say oh you know the way i thought about that before i see why i
*  thought it i don't feel like a fool for having thought it but wow now that now that you've laid
*  out some facts and laid out some counterfactuals i i appreciate the opportunity to change my mind
*  i enjoy that i don't know why i do too well i think we're so often married to our ideas like
*  our ideas are a part of us and we're losing if our ideas that we've been discussing are incorrect
*  if our assumptions were incorrect it's a value judgment against us right you know i think um
*  the nuclear thing is interesting because i think one of the problems with what happened was the
*  shitty design of like fukushima where they can't shut it off it's freaked people out rightly so
*  and it's in the it's built in a bad spot it's terrible spot yeah and the backup plan sucked
*  everything's wrong and now they have this nuclear hot spot that they're you know it's going to be
*  like that for 100 000 years right there's a better way and they never had a chance to find
*  that better way right because they've had a better way for everything else in the later runs the ones
*  that they're operational now are far better than the fukushima one and they could have gotten way
*  way way way way better and that is it's one of those things that doesn't seem like it makes sense
*  like wait a minute nuclear is clean right it's fucking really clean it's really clean if it's
*  done right and if they allowed them to innovate over those 40 years we would have got to some
*  place where it's like super efficient just like everything else if you look at a 1970 car yeah
*  right and then you look at a car from 2020 how about a tesla zero emissions right like maybe
*  they would figure out how to really knock it down to something there are still a lot of people
*  working on next next next next generation nuclear power including bill gates is involved in and
*  including some that are working with using as fuel what's called spent fuel in a traditional
*  nuclear act which takes care of two big problems at once right right right so look yeah yeah they
*  have like be cheerful bunkers filled with shit that's eventually going to crack through the
*  bunker and toxify everything around it maybe or you could also theoretically use that as literally
*  as fuel so you know like that have you seen the thing where they've discovered bacteria in
*  fukushima that's adapting to eating nuclear waste no that's interesting yeah i'm pretty sure that's
*  fukushima pull that up bacteria that eats nuclear waste yeah they're discovering bacteria that's
*  life is so sneaky life just finds a way like those vents those volcanic vents right at the
*  bottom of the ocean you're like what are you doing here this sounds like the way you know crisper you
*  know what crisper is genetic this was discovered it was found the mechanism for that was basically
*  these bacteria that were living in some deeply inhospitable place like this radiation eating
*  bacteria could make nuclear waste safer all right yeah where do we buy those like a walmart you get
*  what was the date you just highlighted there jim 2017 oh april i think that's a different one but
*  that's that's probably something they've been talking about but i think there was something
*  recently where they discovered some uh bacteria that was eating radiation all right i got a
*  question for you joe joe rogan uh let's say that uh we collectively decide that protein is a really
*  important intake for most humans but that some people either don't want to eat meat or they
*  find that meat is too resource intensive etc etc but they also don't want to eat the kind of
*  processed fake meat which is you know processed food etc and let's say that we decide that uh
*  one of the best most available sources of protein if you develop it well as
*  insects okay but that most people find that disgusting what do you do to uh make people
*  less disgusted by something they find disgusting well with all these things i think it's very
*  important to give people the opportunity to choose for themselves right especially with
*  things they've been doing forever like eating meat people are terrified as someone coming along and
*  legislating that they can't eat meat and then they disagree with this agree with this argument
*  they have an argument that life eats life and that we've been doing this for thousands of years and
*  that's why we became human in the first place right and then agriculture has allowed us to have these
*  cities and yeah it's cruel to these animals but you know what you can do it ethically and you can
*  do it morally and it's not like they're going to live forever anyway right so you can have that
*  argument right but then there's the people that don't want to eat bugs well then don't eat bugs
*  right but here's the thing hold on here's the thing for the people that do want to eat bugs
*  it's a good source of protein yeah and ethically we don't feel as bad about killing bugs we do
*  about killing cows i was at an ashram once and um i was actually uh i had a friend that was renting
*  a place that the ashram had for rent so i'm hanging out with this lady who's a a monk i guess i don't
*  know what how you would call her i don't know the debt but she ran the ashram very nice lady but she
*  had bug spray and uh i go why a bug spray she goes we have an ant problem they're getting into
*  the garbage i go whoa i go do you understand what you're saying i go we're at an ashram and
*  you're fucking you're spraying death from the sky on these little life forms like imagine if she was
*  running around killing kittens with a hammer right we would go no fucking way she's like got this
*  shit everywhere they're they're pissing on my garbage i gotta kill these fucking kittens right
*  well to a buddhist right spraying ants with bug spray should be the same as killing a fucking
*  what an arbitrary decision right the kids okay very arbitrary choice you see many vegan slap
*  mosquitoes right you don't just let them eat you there's a there's a thing where we decide that a
*  an animal is not as valuable and big furry animals are the most valuable animals you know
*  one of the horrible truths about monocrop agriculture and there's a video that a friend
*  of mine put up on his instagram page the other day um about farmers this farmer was talking about
*  like when i grow avocados you have to understand like you think you're getting this organic
*  avocado and nothing else to die goes i have to kill thousands of gophers thousands of them yeah
*  he goes i'm gonna kill untold numbers of bugs he goes i'm spraying all this organic pesticide
*  down that's gonna kill weeds he goes i'm fucking up the ecosystem i'm turning up the land i'm
*  displacing all these animals all the places that i'm putting things on there should be wildlife
*  i'm moving it i'm getting getting rid of i'm fucking up this system and like that's an
*  uncomfortable truth that if you even want to buy lettuce which is the most harmless thing like oh
*  i just plucked that head and you know i'll be fine no one's getting hurt no one's dying but they are
*  because monocrop agriculture is devastating and unless you are growing an organic garden which i
*  firmly encourage people to do and i think that would be like one of the best solutions for
*  community although one argument against is it takes a lot more land because the yield is so much
*  lower yeah yeah it takes more land but i'm not talking about for the entire city i'm saying
*  like if we had blocks right like say if there was a block of people right and in that block there's
*  one patch that everybody tended to together right and there was a community my parents actually my
*  parents were hippies and when i was a kid in san francisco they actually were part of this co-op
*  and we would go there and i thought it was interesting but i was seven i didn't know that
*  that was unusual right and we would go there and as a part of this university project that my dad
*  was involved in and they're growing all these crops and i'm like oh this is kind of cool like
*  you just grow and it was in san francisco it was in the city itself had this area where we would
*  go and it was all fenced in and people would grow tomatoes and different different vegetables
*  and stuff and they'd learn how to grow and there was classes on composting and stuff like that
*  people were composting their organic waste and they would reuse it and that is something that
*  could be done inside communities i mean we can it doesn't have to be that we have these giant swaths
*  of land where nobody grows it just take central park for example no amazing park i'm not saying
*  somewhere near there i'm not saying grow vegetables there but take it as an example of everything
*  doesn't have to be hardscaped right yeah central park is this beautiful part of new york city
*  because it's this lush green patch in the middle of this urban sprawl so you have this urban city
*  around it and then it's really cool to be able to go through that and to see the ducks and
*  you know to sit by a tree and although there's this one duck in central park now that got like a
*  plastic bottle ring stuck around its beak it's become a duck cause celeb have you eaten have you
*  ever eaten insects like cooked well yeah what have what have you hosted fear factor oh yeah i forgot
*  about that yeah i've eaten roaches yeah why do you think there's such a roaches do gross people out
*  more carry diseases yeah but don't others not is it because they're garbage eaters because they're
*  because they live near humans that's the problem yes exactly that's the ones that we hate you do
*  have to everything that you do have to appreciate their indestructibility though they're amazing
*  unbelievable they're amazing yeah i mean if you were if i were an engineer i think the roach would
*  be my like inspiration it's a special animal i mean it really is a special little creature it's
*  figured out a way to live in every single urban environment yeah to live inside your walls inside
*  your house and exist in your garbage is the rat essentially the roach equivalent or are all rodents
*  prettier because rats have technically carried things that have killed millions of people don't
*  squirrels as well though no not really how come because they're herbivores they're they're not
*  involved in those tight-knit groups where they spread diseases and i mean they could technically
*  get fleas that could carry plagues and i'm sure they have you know they that's where a lot of
*  people used to get diseases right they'd get it flee from a rat and then that was the plague right
*  and they blamed it on the rats but it was really the bugs and i think that rats i mean have you
*  ever seen the netflix documentary no oh dude i got a long list from you got this walking out
*  of here with a lot of entertainment this one's number one what's it called scratch rats all right
*  it's a netflix documentary it is amazing did they deal with uh this story i've read about years ago
*  when i think this is in saigon probably years and years ago maybe that's that might not be right
*  about when you know there's a rat infestation this has happened throughout history it's happened in
*  many places i know it happened in in south africa not long ago either where the city will call for
*  like a bounty they'll say you kill the rat you so people start breeding and growing extra rats
*  is that in the film no it's not but i know that story i love i love stories of incentives gone
*  wrong because we do it you know you incentivize something yeah people are so gross yeah would you
*  eat a rat yeah for sure yeah have you especially if i was hungry no right i mean it's just meat
*  yeah once you cook it and you put some seasoning on it i bet i have a friend who ate a coyote and
*  what's your meat uh situation right now you're eating you're still eating mostly meat yes yeah
*  mostly uh wild game so mostly what i eat is elk it's stuff that you've hunted yourself yeah yeah
*  but i eat beef steak too right but i've been on this diet for the last like couple months that's
*  basically just meat what what else you eating besides meat that's it no fruit no veg no just
*  meat so what's that feel like just uh weird this is what's weird about it first of all it's weird
*  is your energy levels that you have uh like without the carbohydrate roller coaster ride
*  of the spike of the insulin and the sugar and the body processing it it's amazing it's just
*  steadier you're saying yes you don't get the crash i did hear you talking about though feeling like
*  you are more angry or aggressive in some ways i was still feeling i was joking around about that
*  but i was saying that you almost like have to work out more i think it's just energy i think my body
*  not having to process a large amount of carbohydrates particularly not vegetables vegetables seem
*  pretty easy but they they do like if i eat a lot of vegetables i do get a lot of gas um thanks
*  for sharing appreciate that but then everybody gets you not all vegetables some vegetables are
*  super gassy the jerusalem artichoke is i believe the gaseous vegetable well it's really dependent
*  upon your personal digestion such yeah for sure i mean for people that are your your gut biome
*  sort of dictates what your what's what happens since we're on the topic what happens to be your
*  vegetable oh i don't know it's when i combine a bunch of them together i'm sure it's usually
*  when you combine protein and vegetables together that you get the worst reaction yeah but the point
*  is there's none of that with just meat it's so what do you what's your do you eat breakfast or
*  no yeah what do you have it depends on the day today i did what did you have today i had six eggs
*  and i had uh four pieces of bacon okay that was breakfast lunch then i haven't eaten anything
*  okay gotcha we should say we're talking at 6 p.m local time yeah i had a workout and um i hung out
*  with my dog went for a walk with him right and then uh came here did two podcasts right and uh
*  you're gonna eat again today yeah what do you have i'll eat meat right just but just a plate of meat
*  then yeah yeah does it get boring because i love meat but i can't imagine that it wouldn't get a
*  little it does not it does it gets boring if you think it's boring but it is delicious food if you
*  have it every day you get bored because you have too much delicious food so i think it's really a
*  perspective issue and it's also the health benefits that i've found like just the the way i feel the
*  energy level and mental clarity it's very interesting like there's something going on with the struggle
*  that you have thinking about things when after right after you have a big meal you know that
*  mashed potatoes and pasta oh i'm so dumb i'm like 30 iq points dumber for sure that seems to not be
*  an issue when you are on this steady diet of uh just eating animal foods protein because your body
*  your body creates its own glucose through glucogenesis where it breaks down the protein
*  and creates glucose and as long as you get enough fat that's what's really critical like people you
*  can get too lean where the the meat is too lean you don't have enough fats your body doesn't have
*  fat to process and that screws with you yeah now what about the things that are in vegetables
*  that are not in meat nutritionally are they question are they significant enough to
*  either take supplements or to worry about what do you do that's a good question i take multivitamins
*  i take uh an athlete's pure pack it's like a bag a little baggy filled with multivitamins then i take
*  glucosamine and chondroitin i take a bunch of other different things fish oil i take quite a
*  few supplements and uh and again i'm not telling people to live this way don't do it what does an
*  all meat diet do to your stool if you don't mind me asking um it reduces it it's considerably yeah
*  because mostly you're using like if you eat eggs and meat you're breaking it down your body uses a
*  lot of it there's no fiber right and because there's no fiber which is probably the biggest
*  argument against the diet yeah when you look at research for the benefits of fiber right the
*  research is weird right because it's epidemiological it's all like how much vegetables do you eat how
*  many instances of colon cancer let's coral it was all that stuff is very very very reliable
*  yeah it's very weird so there's a bunch of doctors that are currently like and i use the term in air
*  quotes that are promoting the carnivore diet okay and seeing positive results with it and getting
*  a bunch of other people that achieve positive results the big one is autoimmune issues people
*  that have uh severe skin issues right um eczema is a big one that seems to be cured with an
*  elimination diet which is essentially what a carnivore diet is right if you eliminate all
*  those plants and all those carbs yeah i mean maybe the plants are fine but maybe it's the sugar and
*  maybe by just eating meat and your body has one thing to concentrate on it can relax a certain
*  amount of the inflammation that you're getting has those breads has there ever been a population
*  that's been studied at least quasi scientifically that's had a mostly meat diet for a long time
*  in you it yeah and and what do we know what do we know about cancer longevity and so on
*  i don't know it's a good question anyway apparently now suffer and one of the reasons why they suffer
*  is the introduction of alcohol and tobacco and you know cigarettes yeah yeah and also you know
*  just western life the foods change so you look at those communities it's not the same community
*  as the ones that were just eating seal and whale blubber and eating whatever they can get a hold of
*  the messiah lived for a long time on milk and meat and blood and um they they were very healthy
*  milk from what animal from cows okay they're they're cattle herders let me ask you this let's
*  say that we decide let's say you and i run like america for just a couple days and uh and we
*  decide you know what of all the things that people do that's not good for them um that we feel is
*  a good idea to get rid of right especially if we're going to be having a little bit more
*  socialized medicine right so you're paying my tax my medical bill and so on of all the things
*  that we should maybe you know ban would be sugar right because like there doesn't seem to be that
*  much nutritional benefit to sugar people like it but it's demonstrably bad on a lot of levels
*  um how would you do that let me ask you this why the inclination always to ban things no i i'm not
*  i always go to the extreme just to to show hypotheticals always ban the word ban the food
*  ban the action it is the sport because we're not very good at regulating honestly because we kind
*  of vacillate between an all embrace and hey look i think the best example of how bad we are this
*  is with vaping so like vaping in this country was handled very poorly yes there were the deaths
*  which were mostly as i understand it black market thc pods you're right adam curry just ran over this
*  entire thing in the last okay e-cigarettes are they might get you addicted to nicotine which may
*  be a bad thing although nicotine per se not a bad thing in moderation in fact it's used clinically
*  people have been using it it's a nootropic yeah yeah okay but the uk did something very different
*  with e-cigarettes when they saw people 10 12 years ago starting to use them they said oh
*  people want this we can either say no you can't have it we'll make it illegal in which case there
*  will be a black market and they'll get stuff that's probably not so well made or we can try to
*  deal with it in a responsible sensible way and what they did is they allowed e-cigarettes
*  with about 20 as much nicotine as are in the united states so what you don't have in the uk
*  is a bunch of teenagers who are now addicted to nicotine who never would have been smokers you also
*  don't have a whole bunch of counterfeit thc pods in the uk where people are dying so to me banning
*  is almost never the solution you look at prohibition i mean prohibition did exactly the
*  wrong but do you understand the hustle what happened behind the whole thc ban this is why
*  it gets more complicated the thc vaping ban excuse me the the the vaping ban after they
*  the people died from the thc they knew that those things had nothing to do with it they started
*  blaming cigarettes right they started blaming it because they were trying to introduce a tobacco
*  based e-cigarette right and it was all about the company that bought out the jewel cigarette which
*  was a very popular one right in order to kill it they were just trying to kill the business
*  and then they passed this they're trying to pass this rather legislation against flavored
*  tobaccos right all they're trying to do was clear the room for their business their business being
*  and adam curry laid it out brilliantly it's it's shocking how well it worked and he said it's
*  basically the tobacco version of who killed the electric car yeah it's a sneaky backroom deal and
*  they they hoodwink people and next you know you're oh i don't want the kids to be smoking strawberry
*  vapor right and really they're just clearing the way for this tobacco flavored bullshit because
*  it's made with tobacco right this is the only stuff you can have this is the purest it's like
*  doctors smoke camels it's really like those goddamn commercials they were yeah that's what's going on
*  so it's really just a sneaky business move and we're all like i don't get it like how the fuck are
*  they going to ban vaping when cigarettes are still legal you're talking about something that
*  kills 500 000 people every year in this country alone they die of premature death due to tobacco
*  use and you're not going to ban that but you're going to ban that flavored smoke that didn't even
*  have anything to do with the 10 people that died from the nicotine or the the thc with the vitamin
*  e oil you're also going to drive a lot of smokers who are trying to quit smoking back to cigarettes
*  that's right that's the that's the issue stuff sucks yeah yeah people are mad i can't even have
*  strawberry anymore i was enjoying the strawberry right and a lot of smokers who take up vaping to
*  stop smoking they specifically don't want tobacco flavor because that's too reminiscent of the
*  cigarettes they just want that hit were you a smoker ever no yeah just pot never had any
*  nicotine never oh nicotine is an interesting drug oh i've had it yeah i've had cigarettes
*  when uh i've had a cigarette with uh my friend tony hinchcliffe a couple times before shows
*  yeah and dave chapelle smokes and that when i do shows with him i'll steal one of his cigarettes
*  if you don't smoke one cigarette i'll get you pretty buzz right you get high as fuck right you
*  don't just get high you get like like uh race jittery no no it's like uh your brain's firing
*  like pow pow pow it's one of the things that um steven king said about quitting that really
*  bothered him was uh it was great that he cleaned up the habit and stopped doing it but the the
*  firing of the synapses like he misses that when i wrote my first book i was a smoker not a heavy
*  smoker but i smoked and i was living in the middle of the catskill mountains beautiful place by my
*  self middle of the woods was great that's romantic total that's a romantic writer story it was
*  romantic if there had been someone else with me no it's a romantic writer story it was great i
*  loved it catskills by yourself even even better uh the house i bought even though i didn't know
*  when i bought it it used to be owned by this guy named anton otto fisher who was a painter and an
*  illustrator he was german ran away from home had an abusive father this was in the 1910s or something
*  ran away from home in germany became a sailor talked his way onto a ship got to america i
*  think fought for america in world war one on a ship and then he became like the preeminent uh
*  maritime painter in the u.s in the in the decades maybe between uh the two wars and maybe after
*  he then got married lived in new york and had a kid who was uh had um what do you call it not
*  tuberculosis not emphysema what's the old one where you need to get the clean air fresh air
*  you know they'd send people away no um uh it's something we would know it's a it's a respiratory
*  thing right and the catskills had this clean uh clean air so they went there he built this house
*  and it had he because he was a painter but also because he spent so much of his life on ships
*  he built this studio his painting studio that looked like a little ship with this great window
*  looking out over the catskill mountains that's the house i bought to write my first book it was
*  unbelievably i was so i could focus for like 14 hours a day 16 hours a day writing but the reason
*  i was able to focus so well was because of cigarettes i'd write for about 28 29 minutes
*  total focus go outside smoke the nicotine would just reset all the focus it was an unbelievable
*  drug but it's a terrible delivery system i've heard someone recently say i i recently heard a
*  kind of reluctant trump supporter say the same thing about trump that a lot of the things he's
*  doing policy-wise especially foreign policy or economic policy really they like it so they say
*  he's like he's like a cigarette like the drug is good the delivery system is absolutely terrible
*  that's interesting now how is the vaping did you switch with no i quit smoking long time ago
*  although i quit you know it's interesting i wrote in my first book my family memoir about the jewish
*  catholic family i wrote in there not that i was a smoker but that this one instance where i stepped
*  outside with my brother after this intense moment and we had a cigarette and a few years later the
*  book had been published i was buying for the first i was now newly married and i know that you're
*  supposed to buy life insurance and so i got this insurance broker and he knew my name he said oh i
*  read your book i said oh that's that's great glad to hear and then we started to price out the
*  insurance and he said you know uh what do you do are you a smoker i said no not a smoker because
*  i'd quit a few years earlier and then he called me back and he said you know i read your book where
*  you stepped outside to have a cigarette with your brother all of a sudden i got the smoking rate for
*  life insurance even though you quit yeah even though i quit because you used to smoke yeah oh yeah oh
*  so have you smoked at all now that's not what i thought he asked me are you a smoker i said no
*  because i'd quit but anyway isn't there like scientifically like there's there's a certain
*  time window where your lungs are fully recovered they also say so so this message i would say is
*  really serious for anybody even if you've been smoking 40 years they say if you quit your lungs
*  can actually recover greatly so it's worth it yeah i think smoking is i hate to say it i think
*  smoking is a terrible idea it's a terrible idea there's no if answer on the other hand does vaping
*  replace the feel like adam curry switched to vaping he had this crazy contraption one of those guys
*  is in a really complicated you know garage remote control looking vaping things with
*  he's into those things and i you know he he quit and that's how he quit so the best science at the
*  moment says that vaping is almost certainly much better than smoking yeah because they don't know
*  all the chemicals and all the damage potential damage that vaping may or may not do but they do
*  know the damage of cigarette combustible cigarettes and all the chemicals there are demonstrably
*  pretty bad that yeah so even though like you said we were told uh doctors do it this is the best we
*  were told the same thing about sugar sugar gives you a great boost and so on it's awful but again
*  my take is if you want to smoke go ahead well but wait a minute you live in a finite life but wait a
*  minute let's say now we are talking about who pays right so this is gets back to the externality
*  thing if you smoke and i'm paying for your health insurance as the taxpayer don't i get to have a
*  very good question and how far should we extend that because if you're fat should i have to pay
*  right you you keep eating why do you keep eating right okay if you uh if you don't sleep well and
*  you're prone to heart attacks so am i supposed to pay right why don't you sleep more you know there's
*  there's so many variables are you a guy who rock climbs well what if you fall and break your leg i
*  have to fucking pay for that there's a lot of variables so you got to wonder about when you
*  start breaking down how much how much assistance people get based on their life choices but the
*  way to do that is to is to price it and this is where economists are really useful you know even
*  though they price it out for the individual and punish them for their behavior not punish them
*  tax them charge them right if i want to be a rock climber and a smoker and and everything
*  but i get free free health care then there should probably be a premium or i should probably pay
*  into a little fund that is a free if there's a premium well it's never look health care is
*  never free right not in this country but no no no even in scandinavia it's not it's free to the
*  user at point of purchase but uh yes but no it's expensive and that's what scandinavia has done
*  well we're talking about the user though we're talking about the user having to pay a premium
*  but you're right you're already paying your taxes let's say you're paying 20 total tax whatever that
*  goes into the health care but then additionally right you theoretically i think it's very hard
*  to regulate behavior because again where do we draw the line what about bmx riding what about
*  people who do this and that there's a lot of things that people basically everything you do
*  you have to pay for yeah there's a but there's so many things that people do that we take for
*  granted how about little girls do gymnastics what how much their parents have to pay how about
*  driving in a car yes one of the scariest right how about so many things we should just all sit
*  inside with helmets and watch youtube how about crossfit how much you got to pay you want to do
*  CrossFit you know then then we got to measure the benefit too yes right you're building up your
*  body you're going to live longer well that's possible then you're also probably hanging out
*  with lunatics like you who are riding you know crazy vehicles right so i'm a kind driver but i
*  think that crossfit the benefit yeah as you're getting in shape so that balances itself out as
*  long as you do it intelligently you're you're involved in athletics but should we reward people
*  should they pay less so if someone does yoga three days a week are we supposed to make them
*  pay less i mean i think you get into some weird swampy area and people start to juke the system
*  the same way when you know people uh got paid for rats they let rats loose and then fucking
*  kill them because people are gross yeah but uh we're improving again as a species let's not lose
*  sight of that it's good news i'm an optimist yeah yeah i'm a 100 glass is half full yeah yeah um
*  have you ever tried to turn other people into an optimist and been successful no
*  i don't think i think it's real hard to turn a battleship and even if i've made a uh an
*  incremental push in the direction i've moved in one or two degrees to the right over time maybe
*  it'll change their direction but the the reality is you got to want to change yourself and sometimes
*  someone's inspirational words could be the thing that you needed and that sets you off on a good
*  path and then you do make change but for the most part when someone comes to you and tells you you
*  have to change it's really hard for people to accept just like you were talking about in your
*  episode on changing your mind right which i really loved but i'm sure that a lot of people who've
*  who listen to this podcast or who watch this podcast um have you know drawn in the both the
*  explicit and implicit optimism yes for sure but i haven't had any specific reaction with them
*  i haven't had a specific interaction where i got them to change they're changing because they're
*  hearing me but they're also probably hearing a million other people they're hearing david goggans
*  and cameron haines and you know fill in the blank all these different people that do incredible
*  things and they go why i gotta fucking do something with my life i gotta get my shit i gotta stop
*  drinking soda i gotta stop doing this i gotta you know i gotta just just start eating healthy
*  taking vitamins maybe one workout class a week just one start with there's also though i guess
*  a danger i don't mean to be a downer because i'm an optimist i'm an optimist too but the downer or
*  the danger potentially is that and this relates to suicide so you know suicide is a little bit
*  of a mystery because it's such a tragic thing if it affects someone that you you knew or uh even
*  you know even people you don't know it just seems like such a drastic solution to a problem that is
*  hard to imagine right right but if you look at suicide rates through history and around the world
*  there's a lot of variance but there's one trend that's pretty strong which is uh suicide rates
*  tend to be higher in countries with more prosperity which would seem nuts right you would think that
*  if your life is kind of very very difficult on a kind of maslow's hierarchy level right not enough
*  to eat worried about paying rent or being safe that you'd be more likely to be suicidal but it
*  turns out it's it's generally the opposite not always and what one suicidologist deduced from
*  that or the kind of theory that he came up with it's he calls it's the no one left to blame theory
*  of suicide which is if you live in an environment where let's say you've got a a spouse that's cruel
*  to you or you've got a terrible work situation or you live somewhere where the government is
*  repressive whatever you can always kind of see a light at the end of the tunnel and you can say
*  that you know when that problem is done my life will get better but if you live in a society like
*  ours where you've never had to worry about having enough to eat you've never gone too cold or too
*  hot where you're surrounded by prosperity and you look around at everybody else and like they're not
*  depressed and you think what is it it's me the no one left to blame theory and that's one argument
*  for why there's like right now is a lot of teen and young people suicide in a country like America
*  where the riches are the prosperity is boundless have you read Jonathan Haidt's work yeah yeah so
*  his take on that is that these kids are experiencing social media and they're experiencing this
*  addiction to uh the internet and this uh cruelty that they experience the bullying the meanness
*  the coldness and that when it's targeted on people and when they're losing their position the social
*  chain and they feel left out they don't have the tools to cope with this they're developing minds
*  and this is the reason why you're experiencing this uptick that's directly correlated to the
*  invention of the iphone and the invention of smartphones the invention of social media
*  applications there's there's all sorts of correlations where you see the inventions of
*  these particular things that have changed everything and then you see the uptick particularly with girls
*  particularly with girls and suicide and you see them trying to keep up with the joneses and
*  this this feeling that they're inadequate or that judging themselves against girls that are you know
*  supermodels that are photoshopped and they just feel inadequate i hear you on all that we have to
*  be careful about correlations proving causation because it's really tough because i totally hear
*  you on it it looks like they both travel together yeah right on the other hand history is full of
*  correlations that looked good you know we were talking about polio the vaccine earlier polio
*  for reasons that are still not understood by the way because they never really figured out the
*  disease they just figured out a vaccine they never figured out what caused the disease but it turns
*  out that polio would always spike in the summertime so there were a lot of theories maybe had to do
*  with being outdoors so parents would keep their kids indoors uh maybe it had something to do with
*  swimming pools people keep out of swimming pools but then there was one theory that what else happens
*  in the summertime that doesn't happen in the wintertime ice cream consumption so there was
*  a theory for a while that polio was caused by ice cream on paper the correlation looks pretty good
*  so i'm saying look internet and depression and suicide are a little bit more complicated than
*  ice cream and uh polio but it's hard to tease out effects for sure no you're right but it's also
*  hard to ignore the effect of social media on people's self-esteem people are addicted to
*  phones people are addicted to likes it's a real occurrence it's also been engineered in order to
*  attract the most eyeballs and the best turns out the best way is to get you outraged i agree but
*  again just to bang the same drum again and again where there's agreement with you where there's
*  costs you got to look at the benefits and this is what i hate about politicians is they'll talk
*  about a policy that they like they ignore the costs they talk about the opponent's policy they
*  ignore the benefits so with social media for instance i know a kid a boy who was a friend of
*  the family who if he were born 30 years earlier and there were no way to connect with people
*  other than in person or phone whatever he would have had a very disconnected life he had he just
*  had some issues with with doing that with kind of in person he kind of you know behavior that's a
*  little bit on the spectrum just would have been very difficult as it turns out because of the
*  digital revolution he was able to build a community that is unbelievably good for him are there
*  downsides to these things absolutely but you know you got to look at the benefits i do i do and i
*  know i don't i think we're adapting i think human beings are adapting to a new normal and the new
*  normal is a constant connection with all the people around us all the time if we so choose to engage
*  and look at our phone so choose the problem is when it becomes more invasive than that right now
*  it's if we so choose to engage but if we get to some point where we're wearing something that
*  transmits stuff into our brain or where someone's wearing us or if you don't if you don't do it then
*  you can't be a part of this corporation because we're about succeeding and this is the best way
*  to succeed is to connect yourself to the network to uptick your bandwidth so that you can keep up
*  with us come on steve what's up you know i mean let's team let's go team you know and then next
*  thing you know you're wearing the fucking headband that are you are you optimistic about the future in
*  a general way though people are awesome it's a great time to be alive i love it i love people
*  how i think a lot of people love people how old do you want to live too that's a good question
*  it's not how old i want to live too i don't want to live 300 years in agony and pain right i want
*  to live a healthy life as long as i can i don't know when that when you know what given how old
*  you are now your health now in the state of science and technology and medicine now and where it might
*  be in 20 years uh would you like to be 120 and be it'd be interesting if if i was functional
*  right if things worked i don't want to be a prisoner to my shell but i think that um people
*  like obrey de grey who i had on last week who's a fascinating character he believes we're three to
*  five years away from a giant breakthrough and that when that giant breakthrough has this is my
*  concern the haves and the have-nots will never be more separate than once there's some sort of
*  innovative technology that allows you to live forever but it's a thousand dollars every week
*  or something like that yeah but history shows us that all technologies most technologies start out
*  very expensive and almost all of them get really cheap really fast and you know douglas with that
*  greed with that big ass wall street phone on the beach right and digital era even more so the
*  leverage is accelerated so my thing would be but here's the question yeah would there be too much
*  of an insurmountable head start from the people that are using that technology fair enough right
*  and so there'd be like transitional generation at least two sets of the technology okay they have
*  the life extension technology or the age reversal technology which is really talking about and then
*  on top of that they have the things like what elon musk wants to do with that uh neuralink
*  or some more advanced version of it or the next competing version of it what what if both of those
*  things are highly expensive the amount of head start that a wealthy family would have over a
*  poor family that just has to go out natural fair enough but in the in the scheme of history we're
*  just talking about the blink of a couple generations where there's a transition if you want to be hard
*  and cruel and just look at numbers to me the all right to me the harder question even is
*  whether immortality is desirable or even if like 200 years because you know there's something about
*  scarcity that produces euphoria or at least desire right so i sometimes think that like every day
*  feels precious because you know there aren't that many of them and if i know that there are
*  300 years worth yeah i wonder well that's all scale right 300 years if that was normal right
*  fine yeah i'm gonna be so wise when i'm 250 and then i'm gonna settle down and live the last 50
*  years on the boat i mean that's a i mean people could really think like that right i'll eat
*  vegetables only for that one year between 250 and 250 otherwise it's all meat baby yeah i i think
*  what we're used to is a hundred years if you're lucky that's what we're used to yeah so the idea
*  of 120 is like wow is that real he thinks it is and he thinks that we're probably looking at
*  people that one day in the future will live to be three 400 years yeah i do where i just do think
*  about this though like you know retirement is a relatively new concept it's only for the last
*  like 80 100 years and you used to work yourself pretty much and then you die uh and i do find
*  that a lot of people get lost after they give up the thing they do and it's a it's a you know it's
*  it's kind of a rich kid problem uh you know to be able to retire it's like a sadness problem people
*  need a task i think when people are just waiting around for death to come knocking on their door
*  they get really morose and they just don't feel good they don't feel productive they don't feel
*  it's one thing with old people they don't feel helpful yeah well that's the thing they say the
*  single best if you're feeling down generally about yourself the single best thing they say you could
*  they as though there's some quorum of they who all agree on everything but a lot of people say
*  the single best thing you can do and this was in our loneliness episode as well as service
*  helping other people so do you have you run across anybody that you've interviewed who you thought
*  had a great kind of prescription for how to help other people like doable sensible you know that
*  if people really like let's say i say you know i work hard i try to love the people around me but
*  i really want to have some kind of service component but i don't know what to do that's a
*  question i think first start with the people around you right start telling them you love them hug
*  them enhance the sense of community that you share with your friends and your loved ones do your best
*  to sort of be the person who steps forward starts it off you know like makes an action tell someone
*  how much you care and appreciate them i care about them and appreciate them when you maybe wouldn't
*  have done that ordinarily you can do that we can all do that and we've all had it done to us and
*  it feels amazing when someone comes up to you out of nowhere and goes hey man i just want to tell you
*  i really appreciate you i know i know sometimes we don't talk to each other that much but
*  when i do i really enjoy it i just i love you give me a hug i just want you to know yeah i'm
*  very fortunate that i have a lot of friends that do that kind of stuff i have a real supportive
*  group of friends and if you don't you long for that and i think that's a big thing like become
*  that person reach out and try to try to start that i can't imagine anybody hearing you say that would
*  disagree it's like such a obviously good way to be and yet and yet i find that so many people kind
*  of go out of their way to not just be generous because they're scared this is scarcity they think
*  that they have they have to make it and then if you make it like zero sum they're a loser yeah it's
*  famine thinking it's real real real common yeah our hardware is the same and our software is not
*  yeah and we can manipulate our hardware we just have to understand what the patterns are and also
*  have been there you have to make mistakes you've been there you feel it you understand what it is
*  and then you have that time to adjust that's why losing in life is so important whether it's getting
*  dumped getting fired losing a game lose loss those feelings where things didn't work out your way
*  that's important because it lets you know this is the bad feeling that comes when it goes wrong and
*  you improve and then it makes the good feelings of victory all the better and i mean that you know in
*  a relative sense like even getting good at something forget about victory like making a terrible book
*  that gets rejected by every publisher and then writing a really good one and people accepting
*  like fuck i got better yes like that's that feeling those feelings of failure are really
*  critical for your motivation that's interesting i've always thought of failure like or like uh
*  like yeah failure or just like a bad event i've always thought that they were good
*  because i'm like a scaredy cat in some ways right and then if the very bad thing happens
*  the very thing you feared happens right you survive it and then you learn to shed more fear
*  in more directions you know what i mean well so i could look at it that way look there's a lot
*  of ways you could look at bad events you could say a bad event is just who you are and you just
*  have bad events and you're a fucking loser and life hates you and god hates you and look at that
*  happening to mike again can't fucking believe it there's a lot of guys who go through life like
*  that and you know they could say that they seek comfort in lowering the standards that they expect
*  out of things so when things go bad and they say look i fucking knew it for them it alleviates some
*  concern about what's going to happen in the future because the future is always dog shit
*  so by doing that they've taken away the fear of of succeeding the fear of overcoming the fear of
*  improving the fear of getting better as a human being if you just exhibit the same patterns you
*  fall into those patterns whether it's alcoholism or gambling addiction or sex addiction people fall
*  into those because they're they're accustomed to it it becomes a normal part of your life
*  i think that's a scary thing for people to recognize that they're on a bad pattern
*  and to say okay i have to stop drinking how do i do this right what what steps do i make and what's
*  the best way community yeah they've shown 12 step programs you get together with some other guy and
*  he has looked like i used to drink too much too or we're just people we can help each other i'm
*  your sponsor now and they work together that's i think though yeah though that solution is a
*  really good solution you know uh i have three brothers all older i'm the youngest of eight and
*  i don't mean to disparage them and i also know you're younger than me but i kind of wish you'd
*  been my older brother you'd have been really good maybe i've been sucking up pussy come on man stop
*  crying yeah that's okay yeah no that would a little bit of that would i'm sure i have a sister i don't
*  have a brother but you know having conversations with your brothers and sisters sometimes they're
*  the only people that really know you like i have conversations with my sister sometimes she's the
*  only person that really knows our childhood right so we'll talk about what it was like when
*  we're nine and ten and do you have the same perception of events yeah my sister's super
*  honest right and she's but i mean you remember you remember yeah yeah yeah yeah she hasn't
*  distorted anything right we both have real similar recollections of our past so it's uh but but those
*  people that have experienced those things with you they're like the only ones who really know you
*  deep at your core and the more things you can experience with people the more you're going to
*  share that sort of the people that make me sad are the people that know friends and no confidants
*  they have no one they could talk to they have no one that knows their secrets that they have no
*  one that they could tell a terrible joke to and that you would never say in mixed company right
*  they have no one who you know this especially comedians we're the we're famous for it we say
*  things to each other all the time that are the most horrible things and just to get a rise out
*  of each other you know like one of my friends will say something terrible to me i'm like
*  like about me like horrible shit about me and i'll just think it's so funny i'm like dude that's
*  that is what i look like we're so accustomed to it and there's also in our culture there's a currency
*  of being able to joke around like that of course there's a good if somebody makes one of my friends
*  makes fun of me it's hilarious it's fun like we do it to each other all the time there's actually
*  like a currency and be able to take it too like you can make fun of andrew he doesn't give a
*  fuck it's a good day you know because when people you know i mean you're in the business of making
*  fun of things if you're mad that someone makes fun of you it's not good in our world yeah all right
*  i gotta learn uh i got a lot to learn from you i have a list things i'm gonna look up and watch
*  things i'm gonna read i think we should all be concerned about each other sensitivities but we
*  shouldn't coddle people yeah and that's the difference between compassion and just full-on
*  nerf in the world you know you can't nerf the world and you and and when you stop humor like
*  you nerf humor there's a real problem with that because it's fun it's fun when people talk shit
*  talking shit is fun it's interesting to me how comedy is like the last place in society where
*  you can actually say stuff yeah you can say some come to the comedy store we still say some really
*  ridiculous shit yeah no it can't happen in the media it can't happen in politics yeah yeah that's
*  the art form though it's like i was talking about quentin tarantino's new movie that um
*  once upon a time in hollywood and how he's sort of grandfathered in because there's scenes of
*  violence in that movie against women they're like if a new guy came out of nowhere and he was
*  didn't have a track record and he had some woman getting her brains bashed in on a fireplace yeah
*  what yeah what the fuck is this but when you go to see a tarantino movie you know exactly what
*  you're getting into you're getting it's madness and chaos and you ever seen you ever seen porgy
*  and bes what is that porgy and bes george gershwin musical from the 1920s i guess is it like once
*  upon a time in hollywood no not at all but it's a couple of white guys writing about this uh
*  african-american community in the like coastal south carolina or georgia and it's this drama so
*  it was written as a broadway show and as an opera too and i saw it at the metropolitan i don't go
*  to see a lot of opera i saw this recently and it was very very good it was incredibly moving even
*  though it was opera which wouldn't seem to be but it was so unbelievably against everything we think
*  about now about how to talk about race everything against it and yet it was about 80 actors opera
*  opera singers and actors on stage all african-american right so first of all you have to think it's it's
*  great to be to have a vehicle for that but written by these two white guys and if it were to happen
*  now and i was surprised the metropolitan opera allowed itself to put on this show because it
*  feels from the light of day of 2020 way too dated or racial or whatever and yet what was really
*  interesting is because it's a really good piece of art it overcomes that i think we should be really
*  careful even with bad pieces of art of shielding people from the reality of our own evolution
*  so if you go back and watch some of the early like there's a disney film that splash mountains
*  based on that you can't even get anymore it is this really racist film about the south splash
*  mountain splash mountains a ride at disneyland but it's based on a movie okay it's based on a movie
*  you can't even get anymore because it's it's so problematic out of the archive yes it's so
*  problematic like i think stuff like that it's important to know where we came from like i
*  don't know if you've ever watched some of the old Popeyes i have yeah from the 1920s and 30s
*  whatever it was bluto was a fucking rapist all he was trying to do was rape olive oil he was always
*  grabbing olive oil and trying to rape her that was normal i've been watching cheers you remember
*  cheers i do remember cheers but even cheers but stop and think but i'm sure that was but some of
*  those old black and white cartoons were insanely racist yeah their depictions of japanese people
*  their depictions of african people their depictions of like all the popeye ones
*  fucking crazy and your argument is people need to or should be allowed to see it we should be able
*  to see evidence of our own evolution we shouldn't pretend we just figure this shit out right we
*  shouldn't pretend we shouldn't pretend and look the the fucking there's so many things that were
*  on look the duke's a hazard that took away the confederate flag from the the roof of the general
*  lee you literally can't watch the duke's hazard anymore because they pulled it off television
*  because people were so offended by that flag right look i'm not saying i'm not promoting the
*  confederate flag yeah but i've got a leonard skinnard poster i saw that with the rolling stones
*  yeah rolling stones got second bill how did that happen because lennard skinnard was a shit back
*  then son and on the top of it in one there on stage there was a confederate flag right in the
*  background of the image of them on stage and that was right look i'm not a proponent or a supporter
*  of the confederate flag or the confederate anything but that is a part of history and i think
*  white white washing it i think pretending that it didn't exist eliminating it from the the historical
*  record of who we were in 1980 or who we were in 1930 that's not good it's good to see what it was
*  like little rascals our gang right some of those things were ridiculous but what they were was an
*  example of the way culture and art viewed those times now what about what's what about the argument
*  you say well for the people who belong to the group that's being discriminated against is just
*  too painful that's a good argument but i think that we should recognize that these people were wrong
*  but they existed right don't hide it don't make it impossible to get to because then you're going
*  to make it forbidden if you make it forbidden you're going to make it attractive right you know if
*  nobody gives a fuck about swastikas no one we care you have them up everywhere i'm not promoting
*  a swastika but it's the the fact that if you have a swastika tattoo it's so awful that makes morons
*  want to get one yeah because it makes them want to spark up the taboo right you know there's there's
*  a thing that people do when you take stuff away you know where you make it like you're deciding
*  right that they can't see this anymore and you shouldn't want to watch it but why the
*  fuck is hogan's heroes okay it's a goddamn sitcom about nazis and a concentration camp and these
*  guys are prisoners of war it's ridiculous and they're joking around with these fucking baby
*  murderers you know that's it's a crazy concept for a show that you never could do today i'd love to
*  see you pitch that to a studio here though hogan's heroes again right a new version of hogan's heroes
*  yeah there's certain things you can't pitch anymore right and i i don't think you should do a new
*  version of hogan's heroes but i don't think you should make the old one a banned product either
*  i understand i understand record of our evolution is a good way to look i like that lens of looking
*  at it there's also the idea of how the line between what's your pugnant and not shifts yes and then
*  once you get past it how much access do you want to when it you know yes so just imagine if you had
*  a cartoon today where the main character is constantly fighting off the co-main character
*  trying to rape his wife yeah that's what bluto and popeye was yeah i don't think you could sell
*  that in the room and all violence they're always solving with violence stay away from me girl
*  she's my girl and then they're duking it out and there's cartoon exaggerated violence at every turn
*  every episode his biceps are firing up and he's punching the shit out of somebody
*  so but it's a sign of the times people that back then lived a hard hard life and that was what they
*  didn't want some bullshit-ass fucking modern-day disney movie to calm them down that wouldn't work
*  right if you put tried to put one of them modern disney movies like the lions king try to put that
*  shit on in 1920 they'd be like what are you talking about hard to say we don't know the
*  counterfactual i mean you know the art that's produced as a part of its time if you import
*  an art from a different time it'd be interesting to see yeah i mean look you can make the argument
*  in reverse what happens if you take a bunch of aggressive violent people now and play for them
*  classical music does it work i mean the evidence seems to show that not really is the answer well
*  it's way more complicated than that you take someone who's already life's already gone so
*  fucking sideways that they're violent and they're reaching out smashing people and they're getting
*  arrested and they've got problems you're not going to fix with bethoven yeah although bethoven can
*  go a long way you know a little bit it might make them angry you know it might lead to the no one
*  left to blame theory oh i can't stand this i love how you pick apart everything though and that's
*  one of the things that i really enjoy about your show you look at every single potential angle and
*  today in this in this society there's uh there's certain subjects that people don't like to do that
*  with because it it interferes with the orthodoxy it interferes with this accepted upon narrate
*  narration of reality that we are for whatever reason or another stuck with i think we're stuck
*  with it i think a lot of people have shortcuts because life is busy and complicated and if
*  somebody's done the thinking for you yes and it seems okay on the surface like i touch it and it's
*  not too hot not too cold then i'm going to go with it and the fact is thinking for yourself
*  and ferreting out the information finding the data and then finding conflicting data and trying to
*  measure one against the other takes forever that's why look we barely we put out one podcast a week
*  and it almost kills us just to do one a week because there's a ton of like i think of it as
*  you know i i mentioned i grew up in the country we used to make maple syrup and you would have all
*  these maple trees you drive the tractor around banging in the taps put the buckets and you'd
*  empty them out into the big vat and then you'd boil it down and you'd get this much maple syrup
*  and it was very frustrating because it was damn it's good it's really good but the roi like it
*  took a lot of effort a lot of time to make it and so the fact is is that that's what i do for a
*  living and i enjoy it i wouldn't i wouldn't trade it for anything but i totally get why people reach
*  for the fastest piece of conventional wisdom we're seeing it with coronavirus there's just so
*  much so it's i'm very thankful that there's someone like you who's not doing that i'm
*  can i tell you i'm thankful that there's a market for it yes because that's not an easy that's there's
*  no guarantee of it would have never been the market if it wasn't for the internet because if
*  you had to go through a network and do what you're doing 100 i had a i had a trick uh kind of fooled
*  my way into getting so when i started the the podcast i also wanted to have a radio component
*  but i knew that if i went to like npr or somebody like that series whatever and said listen i want
*  to make a radio show that's basically you know inspired by the free economics way of thinking
*  and we're basically going to interview a bunch of scientists and academics and more you know
*  philosophers and we're going to try to wrestle with these big pieces of of life and uh and there'd be
*  no way that any executive would go for that so thank god for technology it had made it so cheap
*  to make a podcast on my own that i just did it put it out there and then i could go to these
*  partners which happened to be wnyc and american public media and they said oh okay that works
*  there was already an audience for it so that's another case where if you people are able to use
*  the technology that's in front of them and marry their ideas to it you know then but it's also
*  i agree with you but it's also like what you were talking about before where there's so many ideas
*  that like it's so much easier to let someone do the thinking for you right it's so much easier
*  to just fall into place so the vast majority of people do that but there's so many of us
*  there's so many of us there's always going to be a market so even though the vast majority of people
*  might slot into a previously grooved little opening and and fit their thoughts to fit that
*  little space yeah there's plenty of people that don't want to do that and the beautiful thing
*  about your reach is you're getting a pure sample of people who enjoy what you're thinking because
*  there's no reason to listen if you don't enjoy it yeah it's true and look i am very again just
*  appreciative of being in a world where there's people who are willing and able to have ideas
*  that are prima facie unpopular like my my co-author steve levitt when he wrote this paper it's gosh
*  more than 20 years ago now i think about abortion and crime man there are all kinds of ways in which
*  you could talk yourself out of even thinking about that much less writing a paper right so it takes
*  courage but if you look through history if you look at the people who've really changed the world
*  they have courage yeah those are really really controversial subjects that are a
*  uncomfortable fact of our reality and some some uncomfortable facts people would be happier with
*  you if you left them alone yeah yeah um but you know the world doesn't progress very much unless
*  there's a guy like steve jobs or a copernicus or a whatever you know sticking the needles poking
*  people in the eye with a stick and they you know very often they're discredited or hated for their
*  whole lives i love the stories where someone like gets pushed out and then finally toward the end
*  they're appreciated for what they did there was this geologist in england named william smith who
*  kind of invented modern geology but he was not of the the gentrified class and so his work was kind
*  of stolen this is an amazing story told in a book called the map that changed the world by a simon
*  winchester and basically his ideas and his research were kind of hijacked he was discredited he ended
*  up getting thrown in debtor's prison it's a class it's like a horrible story but then at the end of
*  his life he was able to persuade people that he had actually done this work and he was lauded at
*  the very end but like many much more often you'll find the stories of the people who just get like
*  stomped on for their ideas and don't get the credit but you look at the people who've died in disgrace
*  who've had world-changing ideas it's you know artists look at all the artists who were like
*  not at all popular in their time and only now do we appreciate so you know got to take the long view
*  i agree i just i'm just happy that you do it i'm just happy that you're out there and that your
*  podcast really does explore things in every nuanced corner and really objectively and honestly and i
*  think it's a it's a powerful thing appreciate it favorites hey thanks for having me hey thanks for
*  being here man it was awesome we just did two hours and 45 minutes i believe that i really i
*  really enjoyed that conversation i really did too it was a lot of fun thank you so much thank you
*  thank you very much and where can uh tell tell people everything what social media it's easy
*  free free yeah we're on social media just freakenomics as long as you spell it right it's
*  freak f-r-e-a-k-o-nomics n-o-m-i-c-s but you know the main thing is the podcast we're also starting
*  a little podcast channel with some new shows that are kind of related uh so we're doing that in the
*  next year this is our 10th year for economics radio we might do another 10 who knows keep going
*  yeah thanks come on baby appreciate it appreciate it thank you so much
