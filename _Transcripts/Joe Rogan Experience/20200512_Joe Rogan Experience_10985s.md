*  Michael yo, yes back from the brink
*  It's crazy you are the first guy that I've well my friend Sturgill got it and I talked to him
*  But he didn't get it real bad like how bad is not real bad. Okay. He was like a little fatigued
*  Yeah, yeah, so tell to give me the full rundown for people don't know what we're talking about
*  You got coronavirus you one of the first to get it that I know you got it right after you were on this podcast
*  You're on this podcast. You flew to New York did Gotham for four shows little rundown
*  Yeah, little rundown as soon as I landed
*  I did Wendy Williams on Monday and then I flew back and went to Vegas for a day
*  As soon as I got back and then I had three auditions. So I was rundown and
*  That weekend we felt sick already. No, just no just tired tired tired
*  But I mean we're always tired right, you know road the road gets you
*  Yeah, and and I was I was moving all the time and very stressful, you know, you're you're trying to perform
*  You're trying to learn lines for an audition. So I was very stressed out
*  I was traveling a lot and that was like my third weekend in a row
*  So he was sleep much sleep. Yeah, I get great sleep
*  But you know with two kids like they're both at the age where you know, you have to have both eyes on them
*  do you ever
*  wear a sleep monitoring device or anything that I
*  Have but I
*  Whoop strap. No, I I've never worn that but I get eight to nine hours of sleep every night
*  I'm a great sleeper. Okay, like I sleep through anything. So it wasn't a sleep thing
*  I was just I was just tired overworked maybe but Saturday that's Saturday
*  I didn't feel right my temperature went up to like 101. This is you flew to New York. What day it was
*  I performed I was there Wednesday, which would have been I'm guessing at dates May 4th
*  I mean, yeah March 4th March 4th. I performed the 6th and
*  7th stayed the 8th did Wendy Williams on the 9th flew back on that Monday
*  Went to Vegas Tuesday morning
*  Came back that same day then what you do in Vegas besides heroin
*  We were you know, we are visiting her parents my wife's parents with the kids and then buddy was party and no party
*  It was drive-in and drive out. Okay, but that's exhausting. That's ten hours on the road
*  Yeah, and then dealing with two kids in a car and then the three auditions and then that Saturday
*  I didn't feel right and this is you gotta remember when I performed in New York
*  There's only 11 deaths and it was like 3,000 cases. Mm-hmm. That's how much this thing has changed
*  But Saturday, I didn't feel right 101 it went I said I should isolate myself
*  Because I in New York that's all you heard about so I was like, let me just be safe and isolate
*  So let's let's break this down. So you leave Wednesday you go to New York
*  Do a couple of different TV things?
*  Yeah, then you do the weekend at Gotham and then you fly home and then you go to Vegas on Tuesday
*  And then you drive home on Wednesday drive back Tuesday night Tuesday. Oh Jesus
*  Yeah
*  So in and out in one day in and out in one day and then Wednesday Thursday Friday audition then Saturday I was like
*  Okay, I this is my rest day and then I woke up and something just didn't feel right. Mm-hmm
*  So I was going okay. It's probably the road, you know what I'm stressed road
*  So it's about during the day. I hang out I isolate myself, but I'm between 100 and 101
*  Second day I'm like 101 102 but I'm still like look I'm gonna beat this thing
*  They say stay at home because at that time they said if you have symptoms stay at home because they're taking the more serious cases
*  So the Sunday Sunday came around I kind of went down a little I was taking aspirin a lot of aspirin
*  because one doctor at the time said take it every four hours and
*  I was also taking
*  Aspirin and something else to bring your temperature down. I forgot what it was but oh
*  Oh
*  Aspirin and what you said when you started taking ibuprofen that's when it fucked you up
*  That's when I felt it did so Sunday. I started getting this massive headache
*  So that's when I really started popping the aspirin three every three hours, but aspirin or ibuprofen
*  It was ibuprofen. That's a big difference between aspirin ibuprofen
*  Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal and okay. Well, okay. I was thinking I was taking Advil
*  Whatever that is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory. Okay, this is what I keep hearing. I don't know if there's been substantiated that you shouldn't take
*  Ibuprofen while you have this okay. Well whatever reason I don't know what that is
*  I don't know. I don't know if that's been discredited or is that is that real?
*  I don't know either so I was taking a lot of Advil. Okay, a lot of Advil and
*  Tylenol to bring the fever down so I got it down on Sunday, but then I had a massive headache
*  So then they said well your temperatures going down. This was our doctor friend your temperatures going down
*  Just hit the Advil so I hit the Advil Monday at noon. I couldn't breathe like gasping for air
*  And my wife had to call 911 to the house to come get me so I'm gasping for air
*  911 shows up they bring me outside they throw me on this huge this oxygen machine right away
*  They like we kind of an option of that not a ventilator
*  No, just a just a normal oxygen machine, but they say we got to get oxygen in you
*  Okay, and it's almost like a movie. I'm the neighbors are all out ambulance is
*  Overlooking me, you know the ambulance is there all the neighbors are looking I can't breathe. My son is in the window
*  This is the worst. My son is in the window. He doesn't know what's going on, but he knows it's not good
*  And he's only three and he's crying
*  And I'm watching him cry and I can't do anything
*  I can't breathe and
*  Literally when they picked me up to carry me to the ambulance because they need to get me to the hospital right away
*  It was the whole window thing. He put his hand up. Oh
*  Jesus it
*  It really hurt me really bad. So I get into the ambulance and they take me as soon as I get to the hospital
*  The doctor goes you got corona so they take
*  Did they do a test or yes, the first thing they do is they do a chest x-ray
*  Mm-hmm, and they go you got double pneumonia and corona. What's double pneumonia when it's on in both lungs?
*  Okay, so double pneumonia and you have corona we believe but we got in test you so they you know swab me and stuff
*  But they took all the precautions like I had corona. I was the first corona patient at this hospital
*  This how early it was, you know, so
*  They took me to ICU
*  And the doctor came in and I go hey, this is escalating real quick and I'm still can't breathe
*  I go am I gonna make it and he goes we'll know in two days
*  it's gonna go really good or really bad and we'll know in two days and
*  Every nurse or doctor that came in when they can't tell you if you're gonna make it or not
*  you know, they try to comfort you but they can't really say you're gonna make it and
*  And it and I was in the worst pain I've ever felt in my life too where
*  head I mean
*  Just think about the worst migraine you've ever had times 100. My body was hot and cold
*  it would get so hot my temperature got up to a hundred and three point eight and
*  They had to bring it down and then it would go up to a hundred and three point eight again
*  I couldn't move my body was aching
*  Literally the second night I was there
*  And I and I know this is the wrong thing to think but if they had a jack button on life
*  I may hit it. I was in that much pain
*  Like that I couldn't even think clearly
*  It I can't put into words how bad it was for me
*  So your head your body every everything where you just wanted to be over
*  It's either you're gonna make it you're like and it was so bad
*  Where you want to think about your family, but I was in so much pain
*  You know, I thought about them, but it was I can't make it
*  This is this is the end and I can't see my family because they already told me
*  that no one can come into the hospital and
*  I'm texting my wife lying to her saying hey, babe. I'm gonna make it through
*  I'm gonna make it through where I'm talking to my parents going this may not go well
*  You know and my parents the first thing I texted my parents is I'm scared. I'm never texting them something like that and
*  They knew how serious it was and I said look Claire's my wife Claire is at home with the two kids
*  I can't let her worry about this, you know, she was already stressed out enough. She saw enough
*  You know, so I'm in there and the doctor says that no one can come see you
*  So I'm going if these are the last two days of my life. I'm gonna die alone in this hospital and
*  And it just broke me up so bad that
*  You know, I've taken care of myself I've done everything I can you know to take care of myself and why am I lying in
*  this bed right now, you know and
*  It was a thing where
*  When I did think about my wife it was I will never see my wife and two kids again
*  You know that that's all that went through my mind is like I
*  Did they put you on a ventilator? No my doctor saved my life
*  My doctor said if we put you on a ventilator
*  He said that he says because a nurse brought up should we put him on a ventilator?
*  And he goes no way if we put him on a ventilator
*  He's gonna die because his body is gonna say okay
*  This machine is bringing for us
*  We don't need to work anymore and your body shuts down if you've heard in New York 80% of people put on ventilators die
*  And that's why you think I think that's why I survived. I've heard that I've heard that being speculated by other doctors as well
*  And it's very controversial because so many doctors put people on ventilators
*  And the last thing they want to hear is another doctor saying you've put someone on a ventilator. They'll die
*  But you know that my doctor said that straight up in the room in front of me to the nurses
*  Like if we put him on it
*  He's gonna die because his thing was it just makes sense why he would because now
*  This machine is gonna breathe for him. So his body's not gonna it's like working out. You don't work out a muscle
*  It gets weak, right? This machine is doing all your lifting
*  So why would we want to put them on that unless it's it's just we have to put them on it
*  You know, but you've heard doctors were putting on people so fast because their oxygen levels were so low, right?
*  They're like this isn't this is not normal. So we need to do something to get their oxygen level up
*  I think doctors are like everything else right? There's really good ones. Then there's ones that aren't as good
*  No, it's true with everything else with everything carpenters plumbers everything every everything and
*  it's really I look back I'm still now I've become very close to them and
*  The dude saved my life because if I went on a ventilator, bro, I don't I may not be here because I was on a ventilator
*  They kind of knock you out. Yeah, you're unconscious literally that machine is doing all your breathing
*  So, what did they give you what kind of medication did they give you while you were out well, I'm healthy
*  Don't drink don't do drugs. I was the perfect test subject. Maybe that's a problem
*  Listen to this I gave it to my mom. Okay, so she gets home. She didn't tell me why I was in the hospital
*  She beat it in one day and she talked shit to me now. Oh, see I beat it in one day. I have one fever
*  You take eight days and I see you, you know, and then she tells me let's cut you two healthy you need carbs
*  Now she's a doctor now she's a doctor but I gave it to my mom she beat in one day
*  But well, she probably wasn't run down. No dude run down is the thing man, you know, look I'm a guy
*  I take a lot of vitamins. I work out a lot
*  I get in the sauna every day, but I just flew back from Florida. I saw you to Florida and came back yesterday
*  I felt like dog shit and just from the flight man just from the as one day
*  So I scheduled an IV vitamin drip
*  I had the vitamin drip people come to my house hit me with glutathione zinc vitamin C everything and
*  I felt better almost immediately. Yeah, you got to take care of yourself in back to yeah
*  How I don't want to get off me but like how how was that spacing at this venue for you during the fight?
*  Cuz cuz it sounded like y'all are next to each other and then I heard like in a story y'all were separated
*  We were about as far as Jamie is about as far as John Anik was and then DC was like a little further than that
*  because there was a separation there's a
*  Like the octagon post and so for him to get a better angle
*  He couldn't be sitting right in front of the post. So they moved his table like another he was probably
*  15 20 feet from me somewhere around that where people do you feel that I
*  Feel like fighter, you know fighters are tough
*  You know, and I feel like the audience is tough too in the people associated with it is tough
*  Did they move around freely or was it really like oh, I need to stay away from here's the deal
*  Everyone was tested everyone. In fact one guy tested positive. He was asymptomatic shocker a soza who was on the card
*  Yep, and he had an inkling that he might test positive because he had a family member that had it
*  and he was super healthy ready to fight but
*  Had it in his system and so they removed him from the card and he had been wearing a mask and gloves the entire time
*  he was there and
*  Everyone else had wristbands on the wristband showed that you'd been tested. They had temperature monitors
*  They had all these different things, but everybody had been tested thoroughly tested for antibodies tested for this swat
*  I got the swab up the nose. I got everything done. So and then when I got home, I immediately got swabbed again
*  I got a swab yesterday and then I got the vitamin drip and everything like that. Oh, but um, I
*  Didn't get much sleep
*  Saturday night because I was flying back eight o'clock in the morning fights were done. I was back my hotel route 230
*  So I crashed woke up early got to the airport took off
*  Landed and then just kind of took it easy yesterday
*  But until I got the vitamin drip I was dragging I was feeling but and that's what happens when you fly and you had
*  Flown a couple of times a short period of time and then that drive to Vegas all that stuff
*  You have to think of your immune system like troops, you know
*  You really do if there's a battle to be fought
*  You're you're it look if your body was like your mom's where you you know, you had a good night's sleep every night
*  No traveling you can fight off a lot more shit
*  But when you do those trips, especially this is one thing that I'm getting out of this quarantine is man
*  I feel so much better when I don't travel. Oh, yeah
*  So much better when I wasn't dying I feel great now I
*  Feel great now, I feel great now. Yeah rest is a big thing. It's everything
*  It's everything and you know, I'm gonna change my travel schedule in the future because even this trip this trip
*  I wanted to just get in and get the fuck out of Florida and get back home and and you know
*  But then after I did it
*  I was like it would been wiser if I left it like 6 p.m
*  Or something like that, like just kind of chill out give myself plenty time to sleep sleep
*  So I'm fully recovered and then you know have some breakfast then go to the airport
*  You know take a 3 p.m. Flight or some shit. How was it with nobody in there? Did you enjoy the experience?
*  I wanted to do it because I've never done that before and I watched the one card from Brazil
*  they had Kevin Lee versus Charles Oliveira fought in Brazil and
*  I watched on TV and I was like god that's so strange cuz like
*  Gilbert Burns he
*  Knocked out Damien Maia and then he yells out a poha, you know, like the something Brazilian said and he yells out
*  Oh, and you hear it like echo in this empty arena and while I was watching I'm like that's so strange
*  He's screaming and there's no one there. There's no no audience reaction. Like wow
*  So I decided like I gotta do one. So when Dana went asked me if I wanted to do it
*  I was like, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I want to do one. I definitely want to do you feel like the fighters were listening to you
*  The 100% were they made adjustments because things that DC said said Cormier, you know, we're all right
*  So you're that close? Oh, yeah, we're we're at the octagon. Okay, we're still at the octagon
*  We're right in front of the octagon. Okay, I could reach up and touch the the octagon
*  So when well, it's actually a little bit further than we usually are but still
*  No, like like where that wall is. That's where the octagon is pretty close
*  And you know DC's given them points he's like pointers he's saying, you know, he's got to check those leg kicks and
*  Adjustments like he was talking about Carla Esparza and Carla Esparza
*  Backstage gave DC credit for like what what the advice that he was saying in the commentary was the adjustments that she'd made
*  That's great. Yeah, what's weird, you know, I loved watching like I watched the prelims
*  But I loved it because you could hear everything because normally so loud
*  Yeah, but when somebody hit somebody it's in the face you could hear it, but especially to the body
*  Yeah, oh my it was like a thump. Yeah, and then you hear the other person
*  Yeah, I'm it changed the game for me on UFC where you're I think a lot of people appreciated more
*  With not having a crowd yell where you really get to feel the pain
*  Because when it's loud, you don't you see somebody fall, but you don't really okay, it's not but when you hear it, yeah
*  There's different things going on right? It's like there's the energy of the crowd that that's a factor
*  That's a real thing
*  Like there's something magical about a wild finish in front of a packed house at the T-mobile Arena
*  Yeah, everybody's screaming and cheering like wow or like when Conor McGregor walks to the octagon and everybody's going crazy
*  There's something to that it's valuable, but there's also something to just the
*  spectacle of Tony Ferguson and Justin Gaethje just going at it I mean
*  Like wild five rounds slugfest with no audience
*  Do you think that fight would have been different if a crowd was there? No, no, no, I don't think so maybe
*  But I don't think so. It's possible. I think Justin had a game plan and
*  He executed it brilliantly and I think Ferguson mean he's always gonna be Tony Ferguson
*  He's one of the toughest men that's ever walked the face of the earth
*  But I think he was preparing for a grappler
*  You know, he's preparing for Khabib Nurmagomedov and that fight didn't take place. It was supposed to take place in April
*  So he had been training for Khabib by the way
*  This is the fifth time that fight was canceled the fifth time the fight with Tony Khabib was canceled
*  Tony's been training for Khabib for fucking years, right? So he's ready for this elite grappler takes everybody down smashes them
*  He's trying to he's thinking of cutting them from the bottom
*  He's thinking of submitting them and scrambling and getting leg locks and all these different things that he's thinking of and then he's fighting an
*  All-american wrestler who does not want to go to the ground. It was nasty striking
*  so it's a totally different game plan and he has to make an adjustment over a period of just a few weeks and so
*  Justin's fight is I mean Justin always fights the same way
*  So Justin's adjustments weren't nearly as big as Tony's Tony had to make some some big adjustments
*  But Justin just fought a masterpiece the way he fought was just magnificent and he listened to his coaches so well
*  There's a point during the fight where Trevor Whitman is telling him you're hitting him too hard. You're swinging for the bleachers
*  He was just take about 10% off your punches hit him with good clean shots and he immediately made that adjustment and then his
*  Cardio leveled out because he was getting tired towards the end of the second and because he was just throwing just bombs every
*  Every shot he's trying to take Tony Ferguson's head off, but you can't knock Tony out with one shot. He's inhumanly tough inhumanly tough
*  so
*  Justin backs it off a little bit and just is throwing clean shots and then winds up just dominating him
*  And then then they stop it in the fifth round. What's the one thing you learned?
*  Like like was there something you took away from this experience that like you didn't take away from any other
*  Interesting it was interesting. I felt very very fortunate to be there
*  I'm like out of all the people that could be here to watch one of the greatest fights of all time
*  I felt super fortunate that I was one of those people that got to be there
*  I felt like real fortunate for that like everything about it
*  I was like I was like take it in the moment and just like really cherishing it
*  I'm like wow, this is amazing
*  Like not a lot of people get to do this not a lot of people get to experience this
*  Not a lot of people get to do commentary for the UFC period but to do commentary for
*  Championship fights in this arena where there's no one there
*  So we're gonna 15,000 seat arena and there's maybe ten people in the audience
*  So why didn't need arena that big we were talking about that we're like we could have done this in the hotel
*  Yeah, we're gonna get a conference room and set up an octagon in there literally. Yeah
*  I was wondering why they did that but is it a spectacle of having a big arena just to say you did it
*  I think there's something to that to letting everybody know. Hey, these are strange strange times, you know
*  We're in the middle of this health crisis. And so this is the response to this health crisis
*  We're gonna do this shit in this arena
*  But would you do it again because you said you wanted to do one but it seemed like you didn't you didn't mind it
*  So I enjoy well
*  I
*  mean, I love calling fights and
*  I
*  Think as long as I take the right precautions
*  I'm tested a lot and I'm keeping my immune system in check and making sure that I don't do anything that wears me out
*  And I did kind of fuck that up by flying home with just a few hours sleep on Saturday
*  But I took care of myself on Sunday and just hung around with the family and we you know
*  Didn't do much just went on a hike and hung out and enjoyed the the summer and enjoyed the the weather rather
*  It's beautiful weather out here right now. It's not quite summer yet, but spring but I think
*  As long as you do that, I think you can be okay
*  I think when you put yourself in a position like yourself
*  When you wore yourself out or if you have a compromised immune system
*  This is my thought and this is from talking to numerous doctors including my own personal doctor who is
*  Very critical. Well, my personal doctor is very critical about the way we're handling this this crisis
*  What's he say? Well, he says the most important thing is
*  Education on how to keep your immune system healthy. It's like this is something that you're not hearing
*  Everything is social distancing. Everything is cover your mouth. Everything is use hand sanitizer
*  He goes that's wonderful because that's all good stuff
*  But we need education on how to keep your immune system strong
*  We need education on to I have dr
*  Rhonda Patrick coming in later this week to try to school people on what the actual clinical tests the actual
*  Real knowledge of what we really understand about the immune system and supplementation and heat shock proteins
*  Cold shock proteins all the different various methods that we know are actually
*  Legitimately provably effective. I think it's interesting how all these different facts are coming out because when I was at the beginning of it
*  but
*  I've heard from so many after I went through this and big shout out to your fan base
*  To your fan base because they reached out to me and showed me so much love when I was in the hospital
*  I just got out and that means so much to me when they reached out and it was really all love
*  but
*  So many doctors reached out to me too and said there's so much misinformation out there
*  And I texted you about one that people should know about when people get out of the hospital
*  With corona like there's no magical time. They're saying 14 days
*  Literally when I got out the hospital I was in the hospital for eight days
*  The last three days I didn't have a fever so they let me go. They said seven days six days after that. I would be fine
*  but
*  Another doctor told me look after you're cleared after 14 days people still have corona. They're they're taking the chance
*  That it's not contagious and that's why hospitals don't test people
*  And he said that this is why hospitals don't test people before they let them go is because they know they still got corona
*  But hopefully it's not contagious. So that's why they never test because if they did that means people got to stay there two to three weeks
*  longer and
*  That's the real reason he says we would never to can you imagine when New York was going through that like really bad?
*  I mean, they're still going through it
*  But when it was at its peak if they tested everybody that left most of those people would still have corona
*  So that would back up the system even more
*  And then insurance has to pay for an extra three weeks
*  So I learned that I learned that my other doctor said
*  this whole
*  Pre-existing conditions is bullshit. He goes you came in he says this is how much bullshit it is
*  You came in if I would have died in the hospital. They would have said my pre-existing condition was migraines
*  They would have gone down as he said they do are some pre-existing conditions that weaken your immune system like obesity diabetes
*  There's a bunch of them that they're saying in New York are the primary factors. Well that wind up having a really hard time with this
*  Well, he's saying though. They're using that pre-existing conditions and I say it in quotes to
*  Let healthy or other people almost like oh, well if you don't have this
*  Pre-existing condition you're gonna be fine, but it's not true. He's like no
*  It's not true. He's like they're using it to calm people down
*  He goes it's not true at all. He says I see people that are fine. Just like you Mike
*  I see people that do have pre-existing conditions. I see the whole gamut
*  It's not just people with pre-existing conditions, but they're finding those people and highlighting those and he's even that they're even adding deaths to that
*  pre-existing conditions total
*  Because they they need something in deaths to the pre-exists like mine if my pre-existing condition
*  He said if I were to die in that hospital, he says oh, well he had migraines in his past
*  So they would have put that down as a pre-existing condition. Well, how often you get migraines? I
*  Mean ever since I was a kid, but really well, I you got I play college football for University of Arkansas. I
*  Got so many concussions. I couldn't play anymore
*  So and this was before the whole concussion, right? So my mom made me quit. She was like, you're not playing anymore
*  So it was a thing where but it wasn't a condition. I haven't once every I have one every five six months
*  Maybe but he says
*  Would you come in with since I had migraines and they didn't know my history of migraines
*  But he goes we would have had to say that was a pre-existing condition
*  I haven't heard that pre-existing condition being migraines, but I have heard diabetes is a giant factor obesity is a giant factor
*  Emphysema smoke cigarettes, but then there was an article recently something I got super suspicious
*  And I didn't even read the articles an article that said that nicotine may help people with coronavirus
*  I was like, that's the fucking cigarette industry, right? Did you see the documentary merchants of doubt? No, it's a great documentary
*  What's it about? It's about people that are hired to go on shows and put doubt into people's minds about certain things
*  That would benefit an industry
*  So these guys they originally started out the same
*  The documentary shows the same people would go on these talk shows talk about cigarettes marbles cigarettes are not addictive
*  This is this is not the marble man guy
*  These are people that are they're posing like experts and they're on these, you know, those stupid fucking talk shows on CNN and stuff
*  We have three windows and then there's like Anderson Cooper
*  There's a person to his left and a person to his right and the guy on the rise like cigarettes are not addictive
*  It's been proven, you know you web up above and he's good
*  Just rattling it off and then you see that same guy later in the documentary many years later talking about climate change
*  It's the same thing talking about climate change is a myth
*  It's just a natural cycle of the earth human beings have nothing to do with it
*  And it's literally the same human being doing the same thing, but we see that in politics. It's all spin, right?
*  This is this is what I'm saying when I read something about nicotine
*  Being good for people that have the corona virus. I'm like, come on cigarette industry
*  Yeah, it's motherfuckers involved in this is like who's running tests on let's let's try morphine
*  You know, let's just let's see how heroin works on these people. What about coke?
*  You know, you're cocaine, you know, what's crazy about morphine is my migraine was so bad in a hospital
*  They came in and go we're gonna give you morphine. It will knock it right out while you had corona
*  Yes. Oh, like I said, they gave me everything dude
*  Like I was morphine why you had corona so they gave it to me to get rid of cuz my head was so bad
*  I really felt like I was sent you waited your migraines. So the corona virus accentuated those mine
*  I it was so bad. Okay, I can't even put it in the words
*  So when you're talking about the pain that you had you had body pain and then your migraines on top of that
*  Yes, so you're just an act and hot cold everything so they gave me morphine they go this knocks out any headache
*  It worked for five seconds
*  Five seconds and they looked at me and they go how you feel now like terrible it feels the same then about two hours later
*  They came back and gave me more because I think they only can do it every two hours
*  No, but I got I got really hot
*  I can't do this anymore. So they had to stop giving it to me
*  I'm watching this is how this is how I was a test subject and I don't mind because I'm living but
*  Hydroxychloroquine that was big at the time. Yeah, I'm watching this on the news
*  literally
*  The president says try a hydroxychloroquine all the doctors are yes. No, yes. No, yes. No, they come in with it
*  Well, they go in bed. I'm in bed. This is my first day they come in with it
*  I'm watching news and they're talking about it. They come in is like, what are you giving me? Oh, dr.
*  Chloroquine so they give it to me then two hours later come in. I go. What are you giving me?
*  So now they put two drugs in me and then they're pumping all kinds of shit at me
*  I don't even know what they're giving so they're trying things. They're trying things on me because they don't know they don't know that's what's so crazy
*  Right. This is not like pneumonia where people have had it for a hundred years or a thousand years. They don't know
*  This is a new thing. So a day and a half goes by I'm in
*  Probably worse pain. They take me off of hydroxychloroquine and I go this is after
*  Like weeks after I got out hospital go, why'd you take me off? He goes where your body was at that time
*  It couldn't handle it. It was not a good fit. So we had to take you off
*  So I must have got worse overnight and I'm just guessing here, but they must have saw something get worse
*  My lungs were still filling up with fluid
*  So they kept me on the HIV drug and whatever else they were giving to me, but it was
*  It's like I still have fluid in my lungs. They said it would take 12 weeks. I yeah. Yeah
*  They said how many weeks have you been out now eight Wow, and I'm so weak
*  literally, I just they just approve I am like they just approved me to
*  Start working out last week. So I did my first lift society class online and I could like usually I could do like 10 to 15
*  Pull-ups each set I could do two two pops and I'm just weak
*  like I still
*  Get winded like when I talk a lot I'll get winded and I'll just have to catch my breath Wow like an old man
*  Telling you like it for me people with it real bad. It's just not oh you're over it and you can move on
*  You got to build back into it. It's like rebuilding your body in your mind, you know
*  Recommend anything as far as supplements or anything? No nothing. He says it's just rest
*  Well, he's basically done his job, right? Yeah
*  Figure the shit out on your own, right?
*  We'll get strong and literally I was the first person there and then by the time I left eight days later
*  That place was filled with people. That's how fast it happened
*  That's how fast it happened and I saw people like tap it out
*  You know, I didn't see it, but I saw you know, the body's
*  Past the line and I'm like wow, how many people died while you were there?
*  I saw one and that's when it really hit me that and I got close to a nurse I go
*  Did they get to see it goes no, they died in there alone. They they tried to facetime
*  Can you imagine
*  Yeah, and then like you see the stories walkie talkies
*  They're they're talking about walkie talkies. They're talking about phone. They're talking trying to facetime
*  I don't care if I like you or if I like you like that's no way to die by yourself
*  No, you know not not today and
*  It's a thing where I just want people to know look
*  They're opening up the country and I get it. I get the other side too. That's that's why you know
*  I get that people got to work people got to get their lives back, you know
*  But you need to be safe. You need to be safe because it's a thing like if if president Trump said it comes out
*  Hey, we're gonna do herd immunity, you know, you're prepared for that. But right now we don't know what to expect
*  We've gone from 60,000 deaths. Now. They're saying it's gonna be a hundred and thirty seven thousand like what's going on?
*  You know, we only know what they tell us
*  You know, but I'm finding out there's so much more stuff. We don't know because they don't know
*  Now you're finding out that kids
*  Like a very small amount of kids are getting it, you know
*  And I don't understand the whole thing about just not being careful or safe because it's not about you
*  It's about other people like these like the whole thing about well, you know a lot of blacks and Hispanics are getting it
*  You know, yeah, because they're working out all these essential jobs. They're at your grocery stores
*  They're they're they're doing the jobs that a lot of people don't do well anybody that's in poverty as well
*  What you're working those essential jobs, but on top of that you're probably not eating well exactly
*  It's a real problem. It goes hand-in-hand. Oh, yeah
*  You know like their their whole thing like if you can get a whole meal two burgers and two fries and two cokes for $3.99
*  It's a problem with that food. Yeah, you know, right good point. It's it's making you sick
*  Yeah, you know, but that's all you can afford, right? You know, yeah, it is crazy that
*  The cheapest food is the worst for you and the most fattening
*  But that's the one they you go to because you can't afford anything
*  You know, and then you're getting
*  You know, I'm getting stories about you know, like I have a bunch of Asian friends and they're getting bullied
*  I guess it's so terrible like
*  there was a story in Texas a
*  Dude stabbed a guy and his two kids two and six. What?
*  Yes, it happened a couple months a two-year-old two-year-old six-year-old in the in the guy because he thought they were Chinese
*  Like wait, this is in Texas at a Sam's wholesale club
*  What yes, it's people are going nuts over this thing
*  You know like we're all in this together
*  But you don't need to take it just because even if he was Chinese like he's an American probably, you know
*  He didn't bring it over here. Even if he was Chinese from China. Yeah, it's not the person who made the fucking disease
*  That's that's like me who your oldness. Yeah a two-year-old six-year-old
*  Two-year-old six-year-old
*  I
*  Just feel like this whole time right now is giving people and it's a very small
*  Group of people. Yeah, you know and that's why I hate when certain people go white people like no, no, no
*  No, it's a very small number of white people doing it
*  Yeah, I hate when people generalize a group like even the whole Michigan thing. So open carry state
*  They showed up at this lady's office, you know the governor's office they were carrying the rifles
*  They were protesting which they had every right to and people go out here people or you see it a social media
*  Well, these white people don't no, no, no, no, no, there's 356 million people in the United States
*  Is it that many now? Isn't it? I believe so Jesus Christ believe so there's only 700 people there
*  Yeah, you know and probably a third of them just wanted to protest to get their jobs back
*  Just to go back to work. Yeah, so you can't generalize people and you can't hate on people because of where they're from
*  Well, you can hate on people that are so fucking dumb. They bring guns to the governor's house
*  Like what that is ridiculous. Like what are you doing? I agree. Are you trying to take over the governor?
*  Like what are you doing? Like why are you bringing guns? Are you expecting a war? Are you going hunting? Like what are you doing?
*  Why are you bringing fucking guns? That's that's some weird shit when people do that when they they protest with like fucking
*  Kalashnikovs and shit. Like what are you doing? Why do you have a rifle? There was a guy it was a clip
*  I saw a guy was like a white guy to a white guy was like hey, I want my job back, too
*  But why the gun and the guy was like
*  It just walked away. It doesn't mean if you're protesting. That's the thing about
*  The Second Amendment and I I'm a pro Second Amendment man. I believe in it. I think it's important
*  But there's a lot of dumb motherfuckers out there. There's a lot of dumb
*  Dumb motherfuckers out there and they get to have guns too. I mean I support that in a lot of ways
*  I have to support that if I support the Second Amendment
*  But at a certain point in time, you got to go. Why the fuck are you bringing a gun to Sam's Club?
*  Why do you have a fucking AK around your waist when you're walking through the aisles looking for toilet paper?
*  Like what are you doing? It's it's it's amazing how
*  But but let's be honest they're giving a pass you got a you got a USA pass right now to act like that because
*  They're well, no, I mean you do because well because the president's like those are fine people
*  You know like saying yeah, when is he saying that he said that the other day?
*  He goes those are good people that were protesting with the guns with the guns. Those are good people
*  It's just it's a stupid thing to protest with guns like
*  Look one of the nice things about this country is that we can protest absolutely. That's a nice thing. It's beautiful
*  It's important. This is one of things has been infringed upon by this whole lockdown thing where people
*  You know, they're being told they're then they're not allowed to assemble
*  It's a gigantic part of who we are the ability to assemble the ability to protest
*  but I
*  Don't think that's just what they're doing when you're showing up with guns
*  You're letting them know that you're ready to take over you're ready to do something. You might shoot somebody
*  You know, you might if you're threatened you might use these guns
*  It's like okay if if we're in that you're escalating way past where we're at
*  You know if you if you're in a situation where someone's saying hey, your family has to starve to death
*  Hey, you have to stay home. Hey, I don't give a fuck about you
*  Okay, then I understand why you want to show that you have guns and you get to get a bunch of people together
*  You know, hey, we need to stay alive here and we are our rights being infringed upon but that's not what's going on
*  But if you go back to the backstory you find out like I don't know all the facts
*  But I know these people that showed up to this rally. They didn't put on that rally. It was by another
*  Organization through through Facebook or through some social media outlet that put it together and they told you people to bring their guns
*  No, they just told people to protest to show up so see we're all there
*  We're all pawns in this at some point to this political game. So how can you make this is what's amazing to me how?
*  We're in a place where they can put wearing a mask and make that political. Yeah, like that's where we are today
*  80,000 deaths and now it's political if you wear a mask. I don't understand. It's political if you wear a mask
*  Well, I mean most of the people
*  That don't wear masks are
*  These oh, I'm a Trumper like this is what we're seeing on TV
*  What I'm saying is what we're being shown on TV and that's where most of the people get their information
*  You know like from the news or oh, so these people are not wearing their mask
*  Oh, they got to be they got to be Republican not wearing a mask. Oh
*  We need more testing if you hear we need more testing. Oh, they must be liberal
*  Yeah, they want to test like we've made a disease that's killing thousands thousands
*  80,000 and could be up way over a hundred and twenty thousand
*  Political instead of it being about hey, let's all get through this now. It's political. Well, we do that with everything
*  We do. Yeah, and that's a problem
*  Well, we like to get I mean that's one of the problems with having just two parties in this country and having liberal and conservative
*  Which is crazy because there's a lot of people myself included that float in between both of those I do too
*  I'm very liberal, but I'm also very pro-gun
*  Look things why can't you be liberal and pro-gun like can be and I am but I don't understand
*  Why like if a Democrat says something nice about a Republican? Oh, he's not a Democrat
*  The Republicans says something nice about a demo. I agree with what they said. Oh, no, you can't be a Republican
*  Well, if you go on Fox News and you're a liberal people will shame you and get angry at you
*  For using that platform and I've seen it even with presidential candidates like Tulsi Gabbard. Mm-hmm, and even Bernie Sanders
*  I think that we're in a weird place in this country where you know
*  It's easy to adopt a predetermined pattern of behavior a conglomeration of ideas
*  whether those ideas be conservative or liberal and the real problem is these people that adopt these ideas oftentimes they sent they
*  They sink into these ideas because they're comfortable
*  It's easy to get if you like say if you decide people in your neighborhood are conservative
*  I'm gonna be conservative too because that's gonna make them like me more and I'm gonna say the things they want to hear and you
*  Know well, I trust in God
*  I trust in God too and they say these things so that people will like you more and then you'll you'll fit in your community
*  Better and it just it's a it's a signal to the people around you that you're complying with the group ideology
*  And that is more of that's more of the case than people simply
*  rationally and objectively going over these ideas, you know, there's there's certain people that
*  Decide they don't want gay folks to be married
*  simply because
*  People around them have decided that they don't want gay folks to be married and marriage is supposed to be between a man and a woman
*  And you can't tell me any different and the Bible says and this and that and like and I agree and if you agree
*  Well that community will accept you but if you are a person who goes hey Bob, why do you give a fuck?
*  You know if two men are in love with each other like they clearly they're not pretending like I don't care if
*  Obviously have tattoos everywhere, right?
*  I like I don't care if you want to get tattooed if you want to get tattooed get tattooed
*  If you want to be like fucking to cash e six nine that dipshit and cover your face with flowers
*  I don't care you do what you want to do and let's be honest 20 years ago tattoos that was like
*  You're a bad boy or like you're some kind of bad person crazy sailor or something. Yeah, but
*  some some people
*  Will look at other people's choices that don't affect them at all and decide that somehow or another
*  It's an affront to their values. Well, you have two men are in love with each other and they started get married
*  Somehow or another that affects you. I don't understand how it affects you anymore than I understand someone wearing shorts versus pants affects you
*  Or someone driving a red car versus a black car. It's nonsense. It's not your life if somehow or another people
*  Being in a man being in love with a man and marrying a man or being with a man and living and you know having a relationship
*  If somehow or another that like killed all the trees, you know, I'm saying and like cause gas prices to spike
*  All of a sudden there was something wrong
*  But that's not the case no, so what the fuck do you care so as a person who believes in Liberty
*  I feel like you hear all these Republicans that talk about liberty
*  And you know, I believe in liberty and I believe that well, that's liberty motherfucker. Yeah motherfucker
*  Letting someone do what they want to do. That's liberty. It's not like
*  Gay is a it's this idea that somehow or another it's not a real thing two things on God and religion
*  I think religion is looking really bad right now
*  You know if you believe that's great, but it's looking really bad because you're contradicting yourself all over the place
*  Let me stop you right there. This is the same as you saying white people when you say religion is looking really bad
*  That's the same as saying white people look really bad. It's a giant generalization. You're sure very true
*  And I take that back some religious people. Yes are looking very bad right now, but do you know why because they're scared
*  But how can you look?
*  How are they looking bad in what way well I'm saying
*  For instance god, I hate to make this political because I'm not that dude
*  I stay away from but too late too late, but Trump for instance, okay
*  Let's look at it. Let's look at his past. Let's look at there's proof him lying pretty much every day
*  So for religious groups to support this man
*  You're contradicting your whole
*  Yeah, I think that falls into what we were talking about earlier this this political ideology that like he is with us
*  You know he is against abortion
*  He is against certain things, but he's actually pro gay
*  You know Donald Trump is that was one of the weird things about Trump is before he ran for president
*  He was universally liked you know rappers used to talk about him in their song
*  Well, he was always on talk shows
*  And you know he would go on Letterman and shit
*  And he would even go on those talk shows and like talk shit about Rosie O'Donnell and people thought it was funny
*  And now it's horrendous
*  It's like the same things that he has always done now when you're in a position of being the president
*  You're supposed to be a different person, but you don't feel there's a contradiction with churches right now
*  Oh, well certainly with people that look there's a lot some churches excuse me
*  Let me rephrase that some people at some churches. There's a lot of people that will support
*  Values that are contrary to what they're supposedly believe in if that aids them politically if it helps them first
*  Look, there's a lot of churches that
*  Make a lot of money, and then they don't pay taxes that to me is one of the most offensive things about religion
*  The idea that Joel Olsteen should have a giant arena and fly around in private jets and live in a castle
*  Live in the mansions or that what's another guy the fucking the the COVID be gone
*  What's that guy's name again?
*  That motherfucker that guy has got you know he had we bought Tyler Perry's private jet and shit
*  He's a baller right he's a baller for God the idea that that guy doesn't pay taxes is offensive
*  And the idea that he really acts for God like there should be not just an investigation
*  But there should be we should have a trial we should have a truck we should figure out
*  Okay, is this a violation of the whole idea behind?
*  If I don't I don't agree with it at all period
*  I don't think that churches should be able to be exempt from taxes if they get
*  Services like we do if they make
*  Exorbitant amounts of money, and we know they do they should have to pay taxes for sure I agree with you a hundred percent
*  And did you know it's a real clear evidence that they don't even act in accordance to their own belief system
*  There's real clear evidence that they don't even they're not even people that are really acting like a Christian
*  So they're not even acting in their own religious ideology
*  And yet they still don't have to pay taxes
*  I agree with you a hundred percent and now I was watching TV and they can
*  They can get a loan or get this tax exempt where they can they can get money from the government aren't coming to the church
*  But so they're not getting all that even though even though they're not paying taxes anyway like my wife was like we were watching TV
*  She goes that's so horrible a lot of churches are going out of business because my wife is very religious
*  I go why don't they use all the money they didn't pay on taxes to say a lot of mansions and private chats
*  That's what I'm left over bro
*  bro
*  Working for Jesus
*  Hustling for Jesus here's what's interesting to me is my wife when I made it everybody reached out and they go
*  Oh God had your back and the first thing I thought was so you're saying God didn't have everybody all 80,000 people's back
*  Like that's messed up that is messed up. That's messed up. Look, I'm a religious person, but I'm a religious person that asks questions
*  So why you a religious person if you're asking questions, how far do you get? You should be able to ask questions
*  Okay, how far do you take it? You're Christian? I believe in God. I don't know Christian like I go to a non-denomination church
*  It's just one of them hippie churches. No, it's not hippie. I get it. No, no, no
*  It's in Burbank, it's called South Hills. What's up?
*  Burbank of course, it's hippie. It's in Burbank, but I go to a church where look
*  they they don't believe in hate and all that but it's a thing where I
*  Certain people say certain things and when I got all these messages God had your back God had your back and I'm thinking about
*  The dude I saw rolled out. Why didn't God have their back? He jerked off too much. Did he really?
*  He jerked off thinking about guys too. Oh
*  Fuck you
*  You're so wrong this I have no comment on that but it's true it's like why would God I mean
*  Why does God let babies die? Why'd God let that little kid get stabbed the little Asian baby?
*  Well, you're old kid get stabbed. Here's the question that nobody can answer for me
*  Is that if God gets all the applause for something great happening?
*  Mm-hmm. She get all the blame for something bad happening because obviously from what I'm told
*  Look, I'm not a scholar on the Bible
*  But if something great happens, we all praise him
*  But we never tend to not praise him or say we never tend to criticize him when a whole plane blows up
*  You know or you know, and that's the that's the only problem with the religion. I have
*  You say you believe in God where what does that mean to you when you're saying that when you say that does it?
*  Do you say that because it makes you feel better? I feel this is what I feel is I feel
*  Every every
*  Type of tribe before us
*  The ones that had religion or some type of thing they believed in they survived the ones that
*  Didn't they cannibalize each other? I think what religion does is
*  it keeps
*  People float and makes them feel like something better is on the other side
*  And I think it kind of it's the rule of law
*  It kind of keeps people on the right track if nobody had religion
*  I feel we would cannibalize each other just from the past we learned from the past
*  It's the same thing like tribes that didn't have anything to believe in
*  They they ate each other up
*  Well, I feel like we live in a completely different world because the interconnectedness that we experienced today
*  Didn't exist before so today we have access to
*  information and to the
*  vast body of work
*  that people have written about
*  philosophy and ethics and morals and I think
*  We we can understand why it's good to be a good person without having to invoke a higher power or
*  Some sort of divine spiritual entity that's watching over everything before that wasn't the case
*  before when we were establishing civilization and we were moving from
*  Primitive groups that live in tribes which we all came from look if we
*  with the one thing that we have to take into consideration is that we are here because
*  Some people did some really violent shit and they made it through because some other people were trying to do some violent shit to them
*  That that is why we made it here
*  We made it here to this day in 2020 because our ancestors were better at violence than the others
*  That's that's really the truth. I mean, there's no getting around it
*  We are a warlike race of beings that have
*  consistently throughout history conquered each other and done awful terrible things to each other and
*  Took over land and took over resources and took over cities and took over women
*  I mean, this is what what people did that got them to this point and whatever we needed to
*  Get people to act in a more moral or ethical way
*  Whether it's a higher power or whatever it is to get people from just stopping just raping and pillaging their way across the world without any
*  repercussions whatsoever
*  Whatever that is. I'm all for it and it was religion and you could argue and
*  I think many people probably successfully have I'm not really aware of it
*  But I would imagine I'm not the first person to bring this up that religion is in many ways
*  sort of a
*  natural
*  creation of the human mind and the human psyche to try to
*  Move us past our primitive
*  tribal monkey
*  tendencies and move us towards some more
*  Cooperative way of existing. Yeah, I think
*  Where religion gives order some type of order and a lot of people don't want to believe it's over when it's over
*  Well, you know what order exists when you don't have religion you have the order of might and that's what you have in China
*  Okay in China you have a religion and the religion is the state
*  I mean, that's I mean China there people have religion over there. But the reality is what's what's running China is a
*  Dictatorship, it's a military dictatorship and the the king is the ruler
*  This is what they look towards and the the state is the ruler and the law of the state
*  I mean they do horrible shit to their people over there and they do this horrible shit openly in front of everyone and
*  They still run a billion people. Yeah, it's I mean, that's just my take on religion
*  But I also know the other side because anytime I support something also look at both sides. I'm not just blindly
*  I know religion has caused more wars than anything as well. I think people have caused more wars
*  But they're used religion as a nice, okay, you're right people cause wars, but they're using religion to cause those wars
*  Well, they're using religion to get they have in the past use religion to get people to do horrible things
*  And you know, this is the art. This is the argument against fundamentalism, you know that it exists
*  I mean it existed in Christianity in the past, you know the Inquisition
*  You can go throughout the the history of some horrific things that were done in the name of Christianity
*  Some of the most horrific things ever but really it's people doing these things and if they decide that their religion is
*  Is enforcing this
*  Behavior then they can justify these things and you see this
*  I mean, it's what you get with cults when okay forget about religion. I mean we cannot
*  Whether or not a religion is a cult is you know
*  About it where you know a cult is created by one guy and that guy knows it's bullshit in the religion that guy's dead
*  That's the difference yeah, so like like the remember the people the Heaven's Gate cult
*  They all wore purple night. Yeah, and they cut the balls off and they're waiting for they kill themselves when the the asteroid was coming
*  Whatever the comet was coming that is
*  That was a way where someone used something this crazy ideology and got people to do
*  Ridiculous shit and you could say Jonestown was another example of that that was another cult and it was a where this guy
*  figured out a way to
*  Talk these people into poisoning their brothers and sisters and then gunning down federal agents and killing people
*  And they did it all because he had them convinced that this belief system that he was espousing was was accurate and correct
*  What I don't understand because like I said, I'm religious
*  But I ask a lot of questions and I don't believe the bullshit a lot of the bullshit, you know
*  What makes you religion then what religious then I think I think I just want to believe there's something
*  Better and hopefully there's something guiding all of us to a better world
*  To a better place after I want to believe that I want to believe that I want to believe that
*  You know if I were to die in that hospital bed, there's something or something
*  I mean something or someone looking over my family. Yeah, I just want to believe in good. I'm a look I'm all about positivity
*  I'm all about love. So it's the thing where why not believe in it
*  It's not gonna hurt me right believing in it
*  And if it does happen at the end great if you go to a different place great now
*  I will ask questions along the way. I will not blindly
*  Follow a church or religion, you know, I do investigations
*  I really look at the people that's involved with that church
*  What I don't understand is the people that blindly fall into these
*  Cults or churches that you just talked about like I don't understand how your mind gets to a place
*  Where it's like no matter what they say
*  I'm down for it
*  Well other people would say people that are more skeptical than yourself or not interested in religion at all would say how well
*  We take it one step further. Like why would you believe that?
*  Like why would you believe that there's some sort of a superpower that you've never seen any evidence of some sort of a miss
*  mythical mystical power that's looking out for everybody
*  Like why would you think that when there's no evidence of that the evidence that we do have was evidence that people
*  In community and in in friendship and love that there's a great benefit to that and that we feel it
*  We experience it like when like I saw you today. I gave you a big hug. Yeah, like this love friendship. Absolutely
*  That's that's important for us. It means that's real that means something but it also means something
*  Because I want you to know that if you need me, I'm there. I want you to know this is what friendship is
*  that's that's real, you know, but
*  The reality is is there a god watching a doctor got killed by wild dogs yesterday in Georgia
*  Did you hear about this? No. Yeah, there's packs of wild dogs running through Georgia right now
*  It's always been an issue when people let dogs loose and dogs come feral and they don't have food
*  They stop being pets and they revert towards more wolf like behavior. I think it was Georgia. I read it this morning
*  See if you can you find that
*  I'll send it to you if you know, I certainly have it. I have
*  The only problem seeing it that the doctor was a doctor in Connecticut, I guess but was it well
*  It says middle Georgia doctor found dead and then former Connecticut or CT doctor. I'm sorry. So it's not connected. Yeah, sorry
*  Georgia doctor killed by a pack of wild dogs, you know, I saw CT and okay it was in yeah
*  Yeah, so this lady
*  It was a lady it's not the first time that I was confusing this with there was a man who was killed by wild dogs in Georgia
*  a couple of years ago
*  Dr. Nancy Shaw who was a doctor in Connecticut and 3 a.m. Thursday
*  They found her body. Oh, yeah
*  she was on the wrong side of the road and
*  The engine was running the door was open they got out of the patrol car to investigate found a female that was deceased in
*  The ditch the autopsy confirmed that she died after being attacked by animals police confirmed
*  to the station which gave the
*  further details
*  police are trying to find the
*  Roaming beasts interesting that they phrase it that way with us in New York Post
*  Interesting that they phrase it that way with us in New York Post so roaming beasts dogs. Well packs of dogs
*  You know that that is when you just let dogs loose and they got a if you ever had a feral animal
*  I had a feral cat once and a friend of mine and her boyfriend were living in this
*  apartment complex and there was like this
*  Thing where these cats got underneath the building and they had kittens and so she rescued the kittens
*  She goes do you want one of these kittens because she knew I had cats. I was like, oh my god
*  Let me let me see so I went to her house these little hissing little fucking balls of fur
*  I'm just laughing at the idea of you having a lot of cats. Yeah, that's funny to me
*  Three cats have to know but I had three at one point in time. So I
*  I take this cat in and it was crazy. It was a little baby cat, but it was like
*  Like wild I mean fucking wild like it thought I was definitely gonna kill it and eat it and
*  Then I would pick the cat up and it would start purring like immediately like loud
*  Like so happy and then I put it down oh
*  Hiss at me again. This poor thing was wild and that cat was wild to the day it died
*  I was the only one you kept you kept him for years. Yeah Wow, my dog killed him
*  Yeah, he got he talked some shit to my pit bull
*  Check this out
*  Yeah, cuz he would he would hiss at the dog and I guess he fucked with the dog one time the dogs
*  Why is this goddamn thing in the house and he kept pissing in the house?
*  It's like he would piss in the house. He would be like especially was mad at the dog
*  He was like piss near where the dogs slept one day that I wasn't home dog just took it into his own hands
*  Where'd you find the cat? Oh, no. No. No, I was home and he he killed two cats
*  They're both cunty cats that got with them
*  My 20s I was a different man
*  This cat
*  When I had him I was the only one that could pet him
*  I go the only one that could touch him I could go up to him
*  I go what's up, bro?
*  I gotta give him a little pet and then I could pick him up
*  But he would purr and but I was the only one nobody else
*  Anyone anyone else you saw he's like this motherfuckers gonna eat me and he just ran away from him
*  Yeah, it was weird. I
*  man, but anyway, but my point is I
*  Had this other cat that's a ragdoll like I have two ragdolls now
*  They're like fluff balls man, like you pick them up. They just go limp. They're domesticated cats. Like I have a domesticated dog
*  I have a golden retriever. You haven't met him yet. I know sometimes I bring I see the walks
*  I use the best he's the sweetest. I love him to death. Like I wake up in the morning
*  I made a video of it because it's so ridiculous
*  Like how my morning starts like he waits for me outside the door in my room
*  I open the door and I go bro. I go what's up? And he just like he runs around in circles
*  He always grabs a toy. I was to bring a toy over to me and then I'm petting him. He's
*  He's always like he's moaning in ecstasy wagging his tail runs around in circles. He's
*  Domesticated he's just a love bug and he's like this was everybody if you come over my house
*  That's what he's gonna do to you. He's gonna go. Oh
*  He runs around circles around you wants you to touch him. He'll drop to his belly
*  He dropped his back wants you to rub his belly, but that's because of you too though. You domesticated him like that
*  Yes for sure, but he's also golden retriever. Yeah, like he's nice. There's the nicest dogs ever but he's
*  domesticated okay
*  Wild cats are so different than domesticated cats. It's like a different thing man
*  It's that they're so different Mike. He would hiss at anybody to come near him anybody you come near him
*  Like I had to bring him
*  To the veterinarian to get him fixed when he got he got to a certain point was spraying in the house
*  I'm like this motherfucker because that's what happens to the markets. Yeah. Yeah, so
*  The way I got him I had a lock me and him in the bathroom together and then I throw I
*  Forget it was like a towel or a blanket or a bathrobe. I forget what I threw on him
*  But I do because this is like a kidnap in like a girl. Yeah. Yeah, and this is
*  96 somewhere around then
*  Throw this fucking blanket on this cat and then I have to grab him and rest them
*  And then I stuff him in a hamper
*  And then I take him with a fucking duct taped hamper to dr. Craig
*  my
*  Veterinarian okay, why didn't you just get rid of cat?
*  I mean it sounds loved him and I felt like he was like me in a lot of ways that you know
*  He just didn't didn't have anybody that looked out for him. Like he was abandoned
*  He felt I felt like in a lot of ways like look, I don't know my dad
*  Because of that I have this weird thing about taking care of things taking care of people. I felt like I was a bad I
*  Spoken to my dad since I was seven years old and I knew him before that so like all my life
*  I've sort of had this thing like hey that can happen. Well, you could be abandoned and
*  It's one of the reasons why I've always had this very
*  Liberal and charitable outlook on things even though like a lot of people conserve they'll confuse me with being conservative
*  I'm not very conservative with people because I know that things can go wrong with people
*  I also know that some people are lazy fucks and they need to go to work
*  They need to get their ass in gear and stop making fucking excuses
*  But these are like little mental traps that people have fallen into and oftentimes they just don't have the right tools
*  They don't have the right the right information to sort of make these corrections and adjustments
*  So I'm a hard-ass in some ways like that
*  Like some people need to just get their fucking shit together
*  But I also I'm charitable in a way like I don't think they understand
*  How to get their shit together when you see someone who's obese and they're smoking cigarettes
*  A lot of that is education and information and just the way their body has
*  The way their life has gone the things that have happened to them outside of their control before they even became a fully formed adult
*  Just like this poor cat. Yeah, this poor cat didn't ask to be shit out under a fucking apartment building like and then have you know
*  This wild life where it's got to eat rats and shit and try to take care of itself
*  well, I also think that even people like me I'll hear inspiring people and
*  You it kind of kick starts you it kicks you in the ass and say hey you need to get it going like I
*  Told you about David Goggins last time I was here
*  Yeah, I read his book and you know posted shit on my mirror, you know and trying to make strides to
*  But I think I think we all need that it's not just lazy people even people that are out there hustling. Oh, yeah
*  Sometimes you need that. Oh, I need it. I need you know time
*  Yeah, I'm very fortunate to know people like David or my friend Jaco Jaco willing
*  Who's very similar as well like he's got a video that he put up today
*  Go to go to Jaco's Instagram and he puts these up all the time
*  He gets up at 430 in the morning every day. It seems that takes a picture of his watch for him. It's a time
*  David Goggins to 430 does he get up at 430 every morning stretches for two hours and then he hits his run
*  He's an animal but pray play this this is Jaco
*  So easy
*  So easy dripping with sweat so easy to say you're gonna do it tomorrow
*  Well, I want you to reprogram your brain and
*  Tell yourself that tomorrow is not a viable option tomorrow doesn't work
*  You do it today. You get it done today. That's what you do
*  Have a good Monday y'all go get some out
*  That's all you need. He needs people like that in the world. I'll follow this dude. You should follow
*  Who is he that's Jaco willing? Yeah, but a former Navy SEAL
*  Wow is one most inspirational people that I've ever met my life and he now he he writes books on leadership and
*  Brazilian jujitsu black belt and you know every morning this fucking gets up at 430 more in trains
*  Take a takes a photo of his watch
*  Takes an aftermath photo of puddles of sweat on the ground and the tools he used and then takes pictures of the sunrise
*  And the sunset the beach that he earned he earned his right to go look at that
*  Wow, yeah, I wake up at 432 every morning. Yeah, I do but I mean mine would have been like
*  Check out me drinking this matcha latte
*  Get it y'all well it takes every kind of people it does
*  Yeah, there's a song about that. Yeah, there's there's there's all kinds of people in this world and it's okay
*  It's okay to be a soft person. It's okay to be a gentle person
*  You don't have to be this fucking savage like Chaco, but it's something about those that Navy SEAL
*  They're just wired. Well, it's it's not it's not for everybody
*  No, it's most people are gonna ring that bell. Most people are not gonna do it. Could you have made it?
*  I don't know. I would say I would tell you right now if you ask me yes, but of course I would say that
*  Yeah, I don't know unless you've done it. You don't know like in my early 20s
*  I would have loved now if I could go back
*  I would have loved to try to be a Navy SEAL
*  But I guess if you don't have it like if you didn't have that desire, but I just think like that's whether or not
*  It's challenging yourself whether yeah, whether or not you can push yourself past the place that most people quit
*  That's a big part of what it is
*  You know the big part of anything is being able to push right when you get discomfort
*  People do people just want to back off. They won't stop the money
*  It's a thing that we have well natural inclination to seek comfort
*  You you have to have the mind to push past that I don't know mentally
*  you know if
*  Like I was working so hard because those two days in the hospital when I said if there was that eject button and
*  Then your mind just like no keep pushing keep pushing keep pushing and
*  After three and a half days finally everything started my lungs in the fluid in my lungs started to settle
*  but it's it's
*  Amazing what you learn when you come out of a of a situation like that
*  It's it's what you value like I've totally I'm a changed person now like from that and I think
*  And I hate to be cliche, but you appreciate the little things
*  Like I never I've always been a good guy a hustler, but just opening my eyes in the morning
*  It's a different game now, right? You have a gift. I have a gift
*  I have a gift and a lot of your your fans is like hey, it wasn't your time
*  You got great things to to accomplish and I really believe that because I see the death total going up and I go
*  Oh, I'm not I'm here for a reason and I think when we go through life, you'll hit a down point
*  you know
*  But you need something to get you back on track and say yo, you're lucky you're still here
*  You need like I've always valued my family. I'm a family guy, but now it's like oh you want to go for a swim
*  Let's go for a swim you to my son. You want to do this? Let's do this and
*  I think it kind of lit a fire under my ass where I
*  Was I wasn't coasting I was I was doing well, but I just appreciate everything and I appreciate people more
*  You know because man
*  When I was laid up in the hospital
*  I saw comics and different people drop off shit to my house through the ring cam and you I can't tell you how much that
*  Meant to me, you know what I mean? Like you like just people going out of their way
*  Yeah to to make sure your family is okay and even the text even the DMs
*  Those little things like when nothing tragic has happened in your life. I don't think you really appreciate you like, okay, that's great
*  You know
*  But then when something happens to you and these people don't know you but they're reaching out giving you
*  Positive vibes and then people you know really well giving those vibes. It means a lot
*  It you don't understand how much it meant when I was laying in a hospital bed
*  Fighting for my life after I got over that hump to read all these positive message from your fans from comedians from from close friends
*  I mean it it really
*  Pushing you to live
*  Mmm, you know, yeah, the power of word is so much to me now expresses something
*  Yeah, yeah expresses something that you you you understand how close you came to losing everything. Yeah. Yeah, I think I
*  Look comfort is wonderful and
*  Civilization is wonderful and love and friendship is all wonderful
*  But I think to really appreciate it
*  You almost have to at least almost have everything taken away or know it can be taken away or know how fortunate you are
*  Know how lucky you are. I mean we're look man all throughout human history was impossible to take a fucking shower
*  You know, I mean to take a hot shower
*  Who the fuck did that like when did that first start with a hundred years ago?
*  Well, when is when was it?
*  Yeah, so people been around for what hundreds of thousands of years in this relatively similar form and then like a hundred years ago
*  someone figured out how to
*  Turn that thing
*  Hot shower and now this is just the way it's supposed to be. Yeah, dude
*  I went camping with me and Brian Callan. We went camping in Montana
*  We did this hunting show and we back in 2012 and it was freezing out fucking cold as shit
*  but nine degrees at night and you're in a sleeping bag and huddled and and then finally after like six or seven days whatever it
*  was we got to Billings and
*  There's the end of the trip. We had a successful trip and then we got to
*  a
*  Hotel I took a shower a hot shower and it was like a bullshit
*  Panel walls just a skanky fucking weirdo hotel ordinarily if I was a comic like working in that town
*  I was like, oh look at this shit hole. I'm staying at. Yep. I'd like well guess I'm roughing it. Here we go
*  But for me it was like heaven I was in that shower
*  Oh
*  So warm the water was so good and to feel that the soap and to get the stink off me because I hadn't washed
*  Myself in seven days. It's like, ah
*  You really appreciate it. You don't appreciate it until you lose it until it's gone. And I think that
*  Struggle is something that too many people are missing, you know, and I I like to give myself my own struggle
*  You know
*  it's one of the reasons why I work out so hard because I
*  When I work out hard not just because it calms me down and it makes it it does whatever
*  Vanquishes whatever demons are inside me through exercise, but also I
*  Appreciate peace because when I push myself I push myself in a ferocious
*  horrific way where I'm
*  Fucking exhausted like when I'm running hills or I'm hitting a bag or whatever I'm doing. I'm doing it hard, man
*  So that when it's over, I mean I'm hands on my knees heave in and then the rest of the day is beautiful
*  Mm-hmm, because I made my own bullshit instead of like dealing with like
*  fucking hoards of barbarians coming over the hills or you know
*  Starving to death or all the real problems that people have dealt with throughout history that have kind of balanced out their perspective
*  I created myself. I think I think today's society is taking away
*  Challenges, yes, you know, it's not pushing people because it's fine being fine today, right?
*  You know, there's no like one thing interesting. You said to me last podcast we did you go, you know
*  You really never and you exactly said it
*  You've never been through any struggle because I was telling you my life has been pretty good and you go what makes you is
*  You would never take away your struggle when you were younger because it made you who you are today
*  Yeah, and after going through something like what I went through
*  It's changed me so much
*  That I know that struggle is gonna change the rest of my life
*  It's even the mentality of myself has already changed. It's like I'm gonna take risk
*  I'm gonna cuz you never know how long you're gonna be here. I know that's cliche, but you really never know
*  The key is to keep that mentality. Yes. The problem is for a lot of people they slip right back into comfort again
*  You slip right back into the regular life because this
*  this close
*  Call you had with death
*  It slips away in your memory becomes the thing of the past was four years ago or five years ago
*  And you know like oh, I'm having a hard time getting motivated. I'm having a hard time getting to the gym
*  Oh, I mean, I really like to get my career in order, but economy sometimes I'm depressed
*  Yeah, I just I just feel so blue. I sit around the house
*  You're not supposed to make you know and then no one wants to say that to those people but that mentality
*  Literally is like if life is this wild rush to the finish line
*  I'm not sure it is but if it was those people are not supposed to make it
*  They're not supposed to cross the tape. They're supposed to sit back at mile three and take a nap
*  that's just and it's also supposed to be a lesson to you the person who keeps going to see like
*  See these lazy bitches that they ruin their life and wind up falling apart and they keep exhibiting these self-destructive behavior
*  Don't do that. You don't have to do that
*  You see them do it learn from them learn from the people that cry for no reason learn from the people that fall apart
*  Learn from the people that don't know how to pick themselves up and keep going but you can't you can't say that out loud today
*  You give attack. Well, you can't but that's what I know people need to say but you're so right like like the people
*  Who's attacking who's attacking those people the people in the sidelines the people to sit down?
*  Yeah, it's true you Michael you you don't even know Michael yo, yeah I get depressed
*  like
*  So I think some people have real problem
*  They have real issues some people some people but some people and lazy fucks fucks and use it as an excuse a lot of people
*  I think there's way more
*  Yes, because there's a natural inclination to do that and to deny that natural inclination to do that is to exhibit a
*  ridiculous
*  Lack of understanding about human nature because that's what people do. We know that this is it you'd be you
*  it's either willful ignorance or you're
*  Purposely lying so you fit in the group the same way we were talking about earlier about
*  Ideologies that people slip into because it gives you comfort
*  this is like when people like there was a there was a video recently where a
*  Were a
*  Article recently rather were Adele lost a lot of weight and all these why do people celebrate that I was so pissed off about that
*  It's people that celebrate it or yeah, no people that celebrated her weight loss
*  It's like these are the same people are like you look good. No matter what size you are. I'm like so
*  Interesting perspective. That's not what I was saying
*  No, no, but what I'm saying is to me the celebrity audience that celebrated her losing the weight
*  Was saying you same people that say you should feel great no matter what size you are
*  I think it sent out the wrong message
*  Well, I think it's great to lose weight because when you lose weight you get healthy
*  but there was a lot of people that were saying that we
*  Shouldn't do that because one one thing that I read that was hilarious was saying that it's actually fat phobic
*  To celebrate her weight loss because we don't know what she's going through
*  She might actually be going through a hard time right now because she just got divorced and maybe that's why she's losing weight
*  Because she's not doing well and she's ill no or works out doesn't eat cake
*  like my whole thing is if you're gonna I just hate who I hate people and
*  This is a lot of celebrities and this is a lot of know it's like no matter what size you are
*  We love you, right and then a girl lose weight and then you really see who they are. Oh, you look great now
*  We love you. I
*  Understand I understand no matter what size you are. I do love you. Like I have friends that are fat
*  Yeah, I love them, you know, and I've talked to some of them and tried to get them to lose weight
*  But they don't want to lose weight, but if they did lose weight, I'd be like dude. You look great. Congratulations. It's healthier
*  Yes, but I I just love them know what size I understand that but I had someone cuz they're but to me
*  It's a wrong message
*  Like if you're gonna say you love me no matter what size you are like and I'm talking this is more
*  celebrity driven is
*  Listen celebrities, bro
*  Katy Perry
*  You're gonna run around in circles like a fucking dog that dude I'm not that dude
*  What I'm saying is you don't put out this message that body image doesn't really matter
*  And then when a girl loses weight, you're like, oh it really does matter like you're just contradicting yourself
*  Yeah, why are you like me? I don't care if Adele's big or small, you know, I do. Well, okay
*  Good look hot
*  So it's good now I like it as long as she can sing that's all I care about
*  Well, I do care about that
*  But I care when anybody loses weight because it gives people inspiration the same way that Jaco video
*  You know say that gives people inspiration the same way Goggins that gives people inspiration
*  Those people are important and Adele's important doing that man
*  How many women that were overweight looked at her and were like I'm gonna fucking get my shit together now
*  What's that other girl rebel rebel Wilson when she did that movie? She lost a ton of weight
*  Oh, yeah, that girl looks really good now. She's lost a ton of weight and then same thing the lazy fatso's
*  They want to stay lazy fatso's they get mad like she you're just defining beauty standards
*  And she's she was amazing before and you know, it's not good to be
*  Skinny and there's a bunch of people out there that will come up with any fucking reason why they can just eat cake
*  No, it's not real. Look my thing is as long as you're healthy
*  Some people are healthier
*  But like my thing is if you go to a doctor and you're you're too big and they say hey
*  You're not healthy right now
*  You know, you need to change that that's terrible for you
*  But if you're a little bigger and you're healthy because I know some big people that are healthy. I bet you don't I
*  Do I bet you don't I bet you know big people that would be healthy if they lost weight
*  But they're not healthy if they're fat. I mean obesity is one of the things
*  Big people, okay, like like football players. Yes. Okay. Well, that's different
*  Yeah, well, that's what I'm talking about. Well, they mean it would look a little better if they had six packs
*  Okay, you know, that's what I mean, I don't mean a big yeah, okay. Yeah, I thought you're talking about like no
*  I'm talking about bigger people before she lost all the weight. She's obese. Yeah. Yeah, I'm just saying it's a thing where
*  Ralphie man. Yeah, I mean I was I know so many people
*  Went to Ralphie May it was like dude, you got to lose weight. Oh, I was one of them
*  Yeah, you have to man. Yeah, but did he had an issue
*  There was a there was whatever the wiring of his mind. He didn't it didn't it wasn't gonna work
*  He was gonna eat and he was gonna keep eating and whatever it was
*  I don't know what the demon was but whatever his demon was he and I don't make me maybe he could have shifted and
*  Changed and people have
*  But it didn't happen while he was alive. I
*  Tell you one of the nicest men ever he was a great guy. He's a great guy
*  I I went to Nashville with Sarah Tiana and he took us and of course we were like, oh, let's just say how he goes
*  No, we're gonna go to his breakfast place. So he takes us to the best biscuit place in
*  Nashville, you know in Tennessee, but it was just him like hearing about me and coming out and hanging out
*  Just as a comic he was a sweetheart. Yeah. He was a sweetheart of a guy
*  It's a it was a sad loss that no one was surprised by yes
*  That's the problem, you know, it's like if you have a friend and that friend is an alcoholic and they die of liver cancer
*  You got to go
*  You know, I love them. It's great guy, but no one's shocked that that was the result and that's the same thing with obesity
*  It's like no one's shocked when you you do that to your body and then you wind up dying
*  It's not it's not shocking no sad it comes with it
*  I just think I know what you're saying about the celebrity thing is but I really think that it's it's along the lines
*  what we're talking about before with religion and and
*  political ideologies
*  people that are celebrities feel like
*  They're putting out this thing that helps their image and the thing is you can't say anything even remotely controversial
*  If they do people come down on you and if you're gonna say something controversial
*  It should be controversial that leans towards the side of being liberal and being open-minded
*  and being
*  compassionate and I don't think that being
*  dishonest about the
*  Real negative health consequences of being fat. I agree positive. I think it's negative
*  I think ultimately if you can like fat shaming is a real thing, right?
*  Get mad when people fat shame
*  But let me tell you something when someone fat shames you and you feel bad you lose weight
*  If you want to act on that a lot of people do it's a bad feeling that bad feeling makes you feel like shit
*  And you go out and you do something about it
*  The reason why they make you feel like shit is because it works
*  Or you got to take the other court side of the corner that some people feel worse and then do awful things to themselves
*  Well, those people need to get their shit together
*  But look when people make you feel bad and then you make a correction look if someone said to me right now
*  Hey, you're fat. I'd be like, okay, that doesn't work. Yeah, you can say whatever you want
*  It's not gonna get in there
*  But if I was a little fat and I have been in the pad
*  I've had a little bit of a gut before then someone says you're fat like oh, okay
*  I gotta lose. Yeah, but it pushes but it only pushes years if I kept going for years then I would be obese
*  But that's what it is you get on a path
*  But it only pushes people that want to be pushed you see what I mean like sort of
*  It's not gonna work on people that it goes back to the lazy thing. Yeah, it doesn't work on lazy people
*  Well, there's a lot of look now that neither there's education neither does anything. I mean
*  lazy people that the inclination towards laziness is
*  It's a part of the spectrum of human behavior and it's a bad spec. I mean, it's a bad thing
*  It doesn't do anybody any good. It's so it's so unattractive. I'll give you ever had a girlfriend that was lazy
*  Yes, bro. See you said that. Yes. Look how you said it. Oh my god, so unattractive
*  It's unattractive to girls. It's unattractive to guys having us a
*  Significant other that's lazy is offensive. I tell you what if Twitter and Instagram people going after people
*  If there was work involved with doing that if you actually
*  Actually had to go through steps and work to do that you would have no comments, right?
*  Like if people actually had to work to put a comment up
*  Yeah, oh it would decrease by 90% a lot of what comments are is lazy. It's
*  Being lazy going oh, let me comment about this person or fuck her
*  But late people in your life that are lazy
*  It's
*  It's very unattractive and it makes you angry if you're not lazy and someone's lazy and they're dragging you down
*  Like if you're in business with someone and that person's lazy, it's
*  Horrendous get away. It's offensive
*  Yeah
*  and if you are
*  Alt it like if you have a business together and you know
*  This is your partner and your partner is fucking off and not doing the stuff they're supposed to do when you tell them
*  Hey, we got to take care of X Y and Z and like I don't want to do that. Like oh my god
*  I'm in business with this fucking lazy fuck that that's a terrible feeling
*  But if you're in business with someone and they're like I'm on it. Let's get this. Let's do that
*  Hey, maybe we can do that too. Fuck. Yeah, let's push each other. All right. Let's go. Let's get it together
*  High five whoo, and then you like your feet off each other people don't want that though
*  A lot of people don't want that they don't want to be lazy people don't want what's amazing to me when my wife was
*  Was pregnant we were you know a second time with our what our girl that's five months now, but I
*  Was reading stories about mothers being shamed for losing weight so fast. I've heard that I
*  Like other fatso's get mad if you're not big now, you're shaming people for being skinny
*  Yeah, like literally people will get in shape after two months three months after working out. Mm-hmm
*  You know and they're like well, you're not spending any time with your kids since you're in shape now
*  You've been working out showing all these videos. It's like that's an hour a day
*  Yeah, your kid sleeps 18 hours a day when they're first born
*  Yeah, you know you're taking an hour for yourself and you're getting women get shamed for losing. I'm like now this is really
*  We're just shaming people for no reason
*  Well, it's just a bunch of people talking and the problem is it used to be you had to be around those people to hear it
*  Yeah, now those dumb fucks they put it on Facebook and the whole world to read it
*  And then other fat fucks chime in too. Yeah, I agree. There's nothing wrong with it
*  Get rid of them just stuff in their fat face with cake while they're writing it while they're typing it
*  Mean towards lazy people too when you say things like that, it's fun. I enjoyed that
*  Yeah, lazy people know they're lazy too. Yeah, and that's what's great about it. What are you coming up with excuses for?
*  Why you're wrong guess what this whole segment right now about the lazy? Yes, people are really mad that are lazy
*  Only lazy people only lazy people Jaco approves this Oh
*  Like that's what I'm talking about
*  All those people approve the guy my friend cam Hanes that fucking dude works a full-time job
*  We're sort of Department of Water and Power in Oregon. He gets up every morning
*  He doesn't have a day where he doesn't run 16 miles every day. He's running 10 miles
*  Oftentimes we'll run a marathon a day. He runs ultra marathons. He runs these fucking 240 mile races
*  They take three days. Where's the full-time job? Also one of the best bow hunters in the world and
*  Every day you go to his Instagram every day. It's him lifting weights. It's him running. It's him talking
*  It's him saying have a great day everybody. He's got a different approach to Jaco. He's not screaming, you know
*  Failure is not an option. He's got a different approach, but that motherfucker gets after it every single day
*  So if you ever feel like like oh, you know, I think I do too much go to cam Hanes
*  Go to his Instagram page Cameron Hanes Cameron are Hanes on Instagram and you'll go oh, I don't fucking do anything
*  No, you shit this gets a full-time job and a family you realize when you think you do a lot
*  Yeah, you'll find people to do way more than you and you're like, oh, I'm fucking lazy compared to that person
*  If you think you do a lot David Goggins is running right now
*  Right
*  Man I mean but those those kind of people they'll let you know that there's more on the table
*  You can you get more out of your life. You can you could squeeze out more
*  It's not for everybody like that. It's not for everybody but for everybody
*  Doing your best is something that you should strive for for everybody
*  Whatever that best is I mean man if you want to just do yoga three or four days a week or something like that
*  That's all you like to do physically. That's great, too
*  You don't have to be that guy who runs a hundred miles
*  No, you don't have to be that guy that said like Jaco four o'clock at the one throwing kettlebells around like a savage
*  You don't have to you don't have to but you should do something to push yourself and it there's a great value in that
*  There's great reward in that and there's no reward in talking shit on
*  Moms who lose weight too quickly because they're dedicated and healthy and they work out and also it's first of all
*  There's a reality to that too with moms. It's not fair. I I know
*  Moms who are like fitness enthusiasts that gained a lot of weight during their pregnancy and they have a really hard time losing it
*  Their body just doesn't bounce back like other people's bodies. Some women are just savages like two weeks later
*  They got a flat stomach. What look at this but it's genetics as well
*  Genetics so you can't blame a person because they got good genetics and they've been working out right and you also can't blame someone
*  There's bad genetics either and not losing but but here's the in I feel bad
*  For women because if they're a little bit too big they get criticized if they lose weight now, you're too skinny
*  Yeah, but you only getting the skinny thing. You're only getting it from dumb fat lazy bitches
*  That's what I get mad at you. Oh, I can't see it coming from dudes. I can't see a dude going hey
*  You got too hot too quick fucking whore
*  The anger is gonna come from people that are unlucky genetically and that that is but you can't
*  Point to them and be mad at them. No, there was this one lady though that she took a whole lot of shit because she
*  Had a kid and she posted her being pregnant
*  And then she posted what she looked like a couple months later working out and she was saying don't be lazy and then I'll
*  Remember that people got mad
*  Shit and all she was like shit. This is her thing
*  Yeah, like you're going to her to look at her page
*  but that's a different thing because she's clearly got a great genetic roll of the dice and
*  She's shitting on those women that don't have that don't be lazy. Well, listen
*  Some women are not lazy some women they get pregnant and it takes months and months
*  For them to lose weight and it's hard and it's a struggle and other girls are they just bounce back like a rubber band
*  It's crazy. It's not fair but life's not but but some dudes are seven feet tall with giant dicks
*  Yeah, it's not a goddamn thing. You could do about that. Can you imagine being seven feet tall with no dick? Oh
*  That'd be horrible. That'd be horrible the disappointment in a woman
*  Like oh I'm gonna get it tonight it's like like terrible or even a regular dick. Yeah, just a regular day. It would look weird
*  Oh my god, I haven't thought about it that much. That would be weird. Yeah
*  Everything else is enormous
*  40 shoe a
*  Hand as big as this table regular dick what like what just happened?
*  Rages
*  But life's not fair genetically. It's just not it's not fair intellectually. It's not fair genetically
*  It's not fair with the parents
*  You don't you don't get you know, there's some people that got extremely fortunate with their parents. Oh, absolutely
*  Yeah, I mean my parents are great. Yeah, like still married
*  Yeah, and like they love me and I love them and we talk all the time
*  Yeah, I know a lot of friends that parents are divorced or had only one parent. Yeah growing up and
*  That's a struggle they they had to deal with and my struggle was different. Yeah, you know, so I you're right
*  Life is not fair. No, it's not fair. Some people are born in the rich fair
*  Yeah, people should be nice and people should be fair but circumstances are not fair
*  There's really good people that get hit by cars every day
*  It's wonderful people that get leukemia and this idea that somehow or another that it's not you know
*  It's not supposed to happen that way like there's something wrong someone fucked up
*  There's a no, it's just that the randomness of life is not fair
*  And also the fact that look you don't live that long now. You're talking to a 52 year old man
*  I'm 52 years old even saying that I'm like that can't be real like you ever seem real
*  You ever wonder like I got another 25 30 years. No, I get up and I just do it
*  I just get up and do it every day. That's what I do
*  I live in the moment get up and do it every day the moment as much as I can
*  I think my thing is to push me because I always have goals every day too is to push me is like yo
*  I'm halfway done. I got to get it, you know, like that's just my motivation
*  There's a difference between being 50 today and being 50 it is past
*  There's a great picture of one of the golden girls that said it says like 50 in
*  1985 and then it has a picture of JLo swinging on a pole. It's like 50 in
*  2020 it's fucking different man
*  There's people exercise today people take care of their bodies today and they never
*  Didn't right as long as you never went through this period
*  We slacked off and ate cake and slept all day
*  If you never went through that period of alcoholism and drug abuse where you wrecked your body
*  Man, you know you could hold on a lot longer than anybody ever thought you could yeah
*  What's crazy to me is when I was growing up dads look like dads, yeah, they had dad bods
*  Yeah, dad, but but just yeah the body but just physical they look like a dad where today you go out
*  You couldn't tell who's a dad who's single like everybody's taking care of themselves, right? You know from world. Yeah, it's education
*  It is people understand that now they understand like hey, you really do need to do something
*  It's not an option whether or not you exercise if you want to be a healthy person it's a mandatory thing that you need to do
*  when you
*  Speaking about healthy when you were in Florida. I want to take it back. Well, you were in Florida
*  Speaking healthy. Yeah
*  The most unhealthiest place in the world when you were going back and forth
*  Did you like kind of stay away from people in airports or or no? I didn't stay away from people
*  So you know I took pictures with some people a little weirded out by it like maybe I probably shouldn't be doing this
*  But my take on it was
*  You know wash your hands
*  Don't do anything stupid
*  Don't anybody cough on you or anything like that like everybody
*  I was around for the most part other than the people in the hotel
*  Everyone was tested all the people at the UFC were tested all the fighters are tested the workers in the whole thing
*  Okay, everyone was tested and you know in the hotel everybody had masks on all the people like I ate at a Morton's
*  Steakhouse was very nice to sit down me and my friend. Yeah, me and my buddy Eddie Bravo
*  We're sitting there eating a meal like a grown-up
*  Amazing. It's like the real world again. I was there anybody in the restaurant. There was a couple other people
*  Yeah, there was one older couple no mask and some young people at the bar. No mask
*  I tell you when I when I first got out when they first cleared me in my neighborhood cuz everybody knew like literally
*  I walk outside and go for a walk
*  Like they would run inside their house with it if their kids were outside playing they would call them in to go inside
*  Like I was like this guy I went to my I'm not gonna say the name of the coffee place
*  But I went to my local coffee place and since I didn't post I was cleared
*  They the manager of the store sent me a nasty on my Instagram sent me a nasty man
*  How could you endanger all our workers by coming in and you have corona? This is after three weeks. I've been cleared and
*  It's almost like a you're seeing you've been tested never been tested in everything
*  I've been cleared and it's a thing. I got tested manager said that the manager reached out to me personally on my Instagram
*  Yeah, I called I called their district manager and goes this is this is prejudice
*  Like I've been cleared for three weeks and I have a manager just because I didn't post that I was cleared on Instagram
*  It's also shitty. It's very shitty shitty way to approach someone who almost died
*  Yeah, I was so angry and they were scared. I was gonna sue and I just said send you free coffee. I
*  Didn't ask for shit
*  Yeah, they were scared it was it was really bad and I was angry but then I saw it like on my street
*  Like I was a plague like people like literally would run inside
*  Oh, no now it's fine now it's fine now now me I'm trying to stay away from people
*  No, I feel good because I took that
*  Immunity test and they said I had the long immunity
*  Mean so I don't know the term but there's a long immunity and a short immunity
*  It's IG and I it's some and this is the antibodies
*  There's an antibody test you can take at this place called next health where it's not FDA approved
*  But it shows you like your strand is it long immunity is a short immunity
*  Hmm, and they said I had long immunity because it was so bad usually sounds like you went to a fortune-teller
*  The gypsies looking at your hand but but it said like usually the people that get at the worst
*  It's long you will
*  People to get at the worst have long immunity
*  Longer immunity, but it works just like the flu like all the miss message to wear a mask don't wear a mask
*  To me it was all bullshit at the beginning. It's like why wouldn't you tell everybody wear a mask?
*  I posted something on my Instagram today. That was from 60 minutes. I guess it was like last
*  Month I think was last month. Dr. Fauci from March somewhere
*  Yeah, I'm saying you don't have to wear a mask like to look don't unless you have something a mask
*  Yes, the mask makes no necessarily going to protect you
*  There's a cool mask that I saw that's advertised though that
*  They they set this mask up this mask like seals to your face
*  They set this mask up in this tube and they blew cigarette smoke into the tube and then on the other side of the mask
*  It was clear. Yeah, it's it's um, but the whole mask thing is like if you know, they knew people were asymptomatic back then
*  So you're saying only the people with problems need to wear a mask like you but you know people are asymptomatic
*  And you know, they didn't know how many people are asymptomatic
*  But now they realize as many as 78 percent of people who catch this or asymptomatic, but really crazy even if you know
*  3% but they didn't know it back then. Yes, they did. They didn't really they was doing this
*  Oh, yeah, they knew people were asymptomatic
*  But they were just did they know this? Oh man. I mean who knows but I smart
*  I think that Fauci was on 60 minutes, but they had reports that people like in February were asymptomatic
*  This is what I'm hearing. They knew in February that people are much conflicting information
*  But are the problem but regardless if you know, okay, they did know this they knew people could get it by droplets in March
*  They did know that
*  So if people can get it in droplets
*  Why would you have the only people that are having symptoms wear a mask if you can get in droplets?
*  That means if I'm healthy I can get it from your droplets
*  You see what I mean? Everybody everybody can get everybody. So why wouldn't you just say everybody wear a mask?
*  There was so much confusion, you know the World Health Organization in January
*  Tweeted that according to China it cannot be transmitted from person to person. That was in January
*  It's changes so much
*  but the World Health Organization has been in bed with China from the beginning and it's really a big part of the problem with
*  This is that the disinformation that the Chinese government had put out to try to alleviate some of the blame
*  I mean, that's that's their game their game is alleviate blame and
*  Take control of the narrative. So the World Health Organization was in bed with them
*  I mean, that's why Trump although it's widely criticized that he stopped funding to the World Health Organization
*  This is his rationalization for that like they have done terrible things. What also fits his narrative though, too
*  But but it's true
*  It is true and it fits his narrative if it didn't fit his narrative
*  He wouldn't have took the money away the narrative of the World Health Organization. Yes, it's their fault that
*  We're in health organizations fault. It's their fault that we're in this even though we knew about it before it got here
*  We did know about it before it got there
*  But the World Health Organization did say that in January 100%
*  Yeah, have you seen the tweet because it's pretty crazy when you read it today. It's like wow
*  Like this is just a few months ago
*  Yeah, this is four four and a half months ago that they said this and then you're looking at it
*  Like oh Christ, I mean my thing is just going back to March 6 11 deaths
*  And just a short amount of time over 80,000 Montana only has one
*  We need to go to Montana. I know that's what I'm saying
*  Open up the restaurants again, do you if you had to guess when I mean you do like arenas
*  But for normal comedians like me that do like clubs when do you think?
*  I'm hoping we could do clubs soon. I mean, I'm really hoping we can get things going in California again, but
*  Are you know?
*  Bill Maher had a great rant about it is it was really good stuff if you go to Eddie Bob Eddie Bravo's Instagram
*  Well, we can't play in it, but Bill Maher had a really good rant that the key to this is not going to be stay
*  At home forever. No, this is not not it's not how the immune system works
*  The key is having a healthy body and this idea that your body doesn't know what to do with this
*  Your immune system has never experienced that
*  Your immune system if it's functioning correctly
*  It will fight this off your your situation shows that your immune system was dragged down
*  But my doctor said my immune system I was opposite my immune system was so strong it caused problem it overreacted
*  Well, this was the reason why they think hydroxychloroquine works, right?
*  Mm-hmm, it stops that cytokine storm that happens from your immune system overreacting
*  Mm-hmm, that's what they said at the time. I don't know like I I don't
*  They don't know but my doctor was like but you were run down, right? I was run down
*  So that's your immune system running down. Yeah, but from what my doctor said is my immune system was in overdrive
*  But like I said, I don't I don't really know
*  No, there's no clear answer like I go like every four hours. I go all this bullshit
*  Everyone's gonna be fine. We're gonna and then four hours later. We're all gonna die
*  Yeah, it's like that's that's what it was like in March in March. There was so much conflicting information
*  I didn't know whether or not we're gonna be okay or not the
*  The doctor I talked to said he had a patient that was rolling out about 60% oxygen level and
*  You're supposed to be between like 94 and 100 and the guy didn't even know his oxygen level
*  He was just acting normal and they said that's the thing that's confusing doctors right now
*  It could be like you're climbing a mountain, but you're not breathing hard. You're just normal. So that's what a I believe
*  So you can be exercising while that was happening? No, well, no, no, no what I'm saying
*  It's the same oxygen levels you would get from climbing a high mountain like 60
*  Well, I think the problem is so many people do so little with their body that even when although we're saying
*  asymptomatic
*  For a lot of these people it's like they don't ever push themselves. So they didn't even know their body is no
*  No, no, no weekly. No what they're saying is is on this part
*  Is the oxygen level in a person that would come in with Corona was at 60%? Yes, but they were
*  They were functioning like it was at 94 90 where they're supposed to be passed out right, but they're not exercising
*  No, but you do you hear what I'm saying then?
*  What I'm saying is they don't push themselves to the point where they find out that their body's at 60%
*  If you're a person that exercises all the time and you're used to you're in tune with your body
*  And then you're working out you're like god. I'm fucking dragging ass that happened my friend's son
*  And the way they found out it was his mom had it but he had it and the way found
*  I was like just dragging ass when he's working out. Oh
*  I see what you're saying. I see what because when you push yourself
*  That's when you find out like if you're just kind of strolling through life
*  You don't really need a hundred percent of your oxygen, right? You never like yeah
*  Well, you never get to that point, but when you do push yourself and you're like, wow, there's something wrong here
*  Like I feel like really fatigued and really shitty. Well, I mean they must have felt it cuz they were in the hospital
*  So, I mean they were at 60% oxygen in the hospital. So how are you saying? They're asymptomatic if they're in the I didn't say I never said
*  They were asymptomatic. I said these people were in the hospital knowing something's wrong. I'm confused
*  Okay, cuz you're saying it like these people were running around like there's nothing wrong. No, no, no
*  No, I'm saying the doctors are confused right now because the normal oxygen level is between 94 and 100
*  Okay, there are people checking in with Corona that don't feel well
*  But they're at 60% oxygen level which you shouldn't be able to function why not
*  I don't know the technical but this is what the doctor's saying where you could look it up
*  But you shouldn't be able to function but they're texting they're acting like nothing's wrong, but they're sick
*  I think there's so many people they're so used to feeling like shit. I don't know
*  But that level is so low like they said they should be not even moving
*  Yeah, I was reading something about that as well these people but I'm not a doctor so I don't know how to explain it
*  Right, but that's what's confusing to them right now
*  And then you hear the kid thing now the kids are getting a certain form of it like 85 kids in New York
*  It's it's 85 kids 85 kids. I mean, it's a small number, but what are they getting? It's it's attached to coronavirus
*  It's inflammation
*  Inside and it's not like I said, I'm not a doctor, but I just read about it today
*  I have to keep saying I'm not a doctor. I do because people will take your shit so seriously like well
*  He went through corona. He must know everything about it. No, I know nothing like they did give it a southern accent right there
*  I know I did
*  Lot of them are really dumb
*  Do you know what that came from?
*  Do you know what that's from what hookworm hookworm? Yeah, it's really crazy the the
*  Stereotype of the lazy mouth breathing southerner came from
*  massive amounts of people that were infected with parasites and
*  These parasites were extremely common particularly when people walk around barefoot and they would get these worms
*  These worms would get into their system and one of the side effects of these worms was a decreased brain function
*  So that's a that's a real stereotype that came from a real thing. So yeah pull up a
*  hookworm in the south
*  And then stereotypes because yeah, I forget who told me this then I wound up going on a deep dive one night and just reading
*  article upon article about this where
*  They didn't even find out that this was a thing. So I think it was like the 1960s
*  They found out about this hookworm parasite and this parasite that was
*  Extremely prevalent in the south these things many of like how hookworm gave the south a bad name
*  Hook worms once sapped the American south of its health yet few realize they continue to affect millions
*  so this is a this worm would
*  Infect people that make that a little larger place for more than three centuries a plague of unshakable lethargy
*  Blanketed the American South it began with ground itch in in quotes a prickly
*  Tingling in the tender webs between the toes which was soon followed by a dry cough
*  weeks later victims succumb to an insatiable exhaustion and an
*  impenetrable
*  Haziness of the mind that some called stupidity adults neglected their fields and children grew pale and listless
*  Victims developed grossly distended bellies and angel wings
*  emaciated shoulder blades accentuated by the hunching all
*  Gazed out dully from sunken sockets with a telltale
*  Fish-eye stare the culprit behind the germ of laziness as a south affliction was sometimes called was
*  Nectar Americanus the American murderer better known today as the hookworm millions of these blood-sucking
*  Parasites lived parasites lived fed
*  multiplied and died within the guts of up to 40% of the population stretching from
*  Southeastern, Texas to West Virginia
*  Hookworms stymied development throughout the region and bred stereotypes about lazy
*  moronic southerners
*  That's it that's why you do it that's why we all do it
*  We do it because it was a real thing and it was a real thing because there's poor people were sick with parasites
*  Wow wow wow wow I learned some shit today Joe and then a nutty one that's not I'm from Texas
*  That's when you go. Oh, okay. Well that shit that makes sense. I always used to think was just hot there and it's hard to think
*  Like you know well now when people say you don't sound like you're from Texas. I'm like, thank you
*  I could hear a little really yes, there's a touch. I say y'all still there's a touch. It's a touch. You know
*  No, you didn't know that there's no touch. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, you have a touch a sec
*  Okay, southern some Texan in there just a touch. Yeah, but you're definitely not from New York. No. Yeah, I mean not from Boston
*  It's like you have something something going on there Boston Corona is really bad right now. Oh, it's real bad. Yeah
*  Yeah, it's um they believe that there's a different strain on the East Coast than on the West Coast
*  I agree with that a hundred percent. I know I know it's coast strain. I know I did yeah
*  You got that hot strain from New York. Yes, you did. I think I think I my friend
*  Sent me a picture because I didn't I didn't do any meet-and-greets, but I had friends come
*  So he sent me a picture two weeks after they know I survived or like three weeks ago. You're fine. You're feeling good
*  You're all good. Yeah, yeah, so he sends me a picture. It's me and four of his friends. He goes we all got it
*  We must have gave it to you
*  Whoa, so you were hanging around with the fucking patient zeros in New York. Mm-hmm. What were you guys doing?
*  Oh, you know how they come to the green room and just say what's up great show
*  So and literally hug in and it was one picture
*  And they all got it and everybody in that picture at it. So
*  the comedian I know who'd you work with in Gotham, it was tone Bell and
*  Did they get it Joe look no
*  No, nobody I
*  Worked with in New York and flew back with got it
*  So it was only the people that you were hanging out with in the green room because no comics were in the green room
*  They came back, but then there was like five people so they kind of
*  in and digging into your fucking craft service
*  Literally, I tell you it was about it was like two minutes, but it was a bunch of hugs kisses
*  That's all it took man and he sent me the picture says now that we know you well
*  How those people do they survive it? No problem. All of them survive one person one girl got sick for like two weeks
*  But it wasn't bad. Not like you know, not like you know, it worse than anybody
*  I haven't heard of any comics like that. I know I've gotten it. No, I haven't either
*  You know, I really think it had to do with you being so run-down
*  Yeah, I mean it's the only thing that makes sense because I know man me personally
*  I am a different human being when I travel too much. I just get wrecked
*  Yeah, you just get wrecked like my brains foggy like my kids ask me questions. I don't have the answers
*  I don't have the will to do things. I'm a different person when I travel too much
*  Yeah, it will it's a thing where after I beat this thing. It's that road to recovery like, you know now
*  It's trying to get stronger trying to like I have my energy still but it's just you know when your body's just not right
*  Yeah, it's just like oh, it's trying to catch up, you know, and I just feel like I'm that dude
*  Just trying to catch up. Are you a regular taker of vitamins? Yes. We have before this
*  I
*  Wouldn't say like I'm a great vitamin taker even today
*  Because I just I hear so much about I don't know if somebody said this is what you need to take
*  Then I would take it but I hear a different thing. Oh take Catalin take zinc take this take that what's Catalin?
*  It's some it's some vitamin that my wife's father gave me
*  Yeah, I've heard of it Catalin it's from I forgot the name of the
*  The it's these pills that supposed to be all organic and I forgot. Oh, it's a company
*  No, no, no Catalin is a pill from this company. I don't know what it does. He just said it's healthy
*  just taking my wife's been taking it all our life and
*  So I started taking it, but I'm not sure it's supposed to be healthy. I
*  Take every day I take 4,000 milligrams of vitamin C. I take
*  5,000 I use of vitamin D. I take a bunch of the shit fish oil
*  I take glutathione. I don't fuck around man. Yeah, especially when when this started happening
*  I I bore down seriously like I feel like if somebody gave me this is what you need to take in a day
*  I would take it right now. I just don't have that person to say hey, here's the list
*  Well, dr. Rhonda Patrick will be on this week and when she's on this week, I'm gonna put something out
*  Oh, please she she talks about it. I'll put it on my Instagram
*  No, I would love that because what you should do to strengthen your immune system. Do you have a sauna in your house?
*  No, she got a sauna. Yeah, I I used to go to a sauna place
*  But obviously they're closed but those are great if you go to one of them public ones
*  What kind of funk is going? I know a guy who actually thinks he got it in a sauna
*  He went in a sauna and he's like that's the seems to me where I got I think there was a really coffin in a sauna
*  Well, no these were
*  No, but the place I went to it's your own booth, but they clean it really good your own booth
*  Yeah, it's these little hot boxes. Is that an infrared one though? Yeah infrared
*  Yeah
*  I don't know if that's really the way to go
*  Laird Hamilton seems to think that it isn't and I listen to him a lot when it comes to these sort of things because he
*  Does a lot of a lot of sauna work and breath work and things like that
*  And he said he developed some real skin issues from infrared saunas the studies that were done
*  Is it Norway that did those studies on sauna use?
*  They did studies that showed a 40% decrease of all cause
*  Mortality for people who regularly use the sauna using the sauna four to five days a week
*  They sewed a 40% new so four to five days a week. I think it was a hundred and sixty degree temperature
*  For 20 minutes and they showed a 40% decrease of all cause mortality cancer stroke
*  Heart attack everything all the different things because of the body's production of heat shock proteins from regular sauna use
*  So I have not skipped a day not one day of a sauna since this happened
*  I'm very lucky that I have one in my house and I have one here at the studio
*  So I've been doing it every fucking day and I've talked some friends into getting ones where they didn't have room for it in
*  Their house with the Costco sells them you can get a fuck. Yeah outdoor sauna barrel sauna like a thousand bucks
*  I'm like think all the shit you spend money on and if you if you can afford this
*  Please get one because I think it's massively contributed to my health and also like
*  Alleviation of aches and pains. I just feel good. I get it every fucking day. I
*  When I was on my routine, I loved it. Yeah loved it, but then everything shut down and I'm like, okay
*  Maybe that's an investment. Do you have room in your yard? Oh, yeah
*  Saunas, bro. Yeah
*  Definitely gonna do that. Yeah, I get in the sauna
*  I do 25 minutes at 180 degrees and then I jump in the pool and I do laps. That's how I end it
*  That's how cool I I
*  Speaking about health I after this is over. I was talking to my doctor. I want to go back in
*  You know because we're saying it could be my immune, but this is really open my eye
*  Maybe I do have something underlying, you know, it makes me want to see okay
*  What could have caused it besides my immune if there is something like this is the first time I really want to get checked
*  Out but you've been a guy who gets colds on a regular basis. No, no
*  I'm not this one first time in the hospital besides the concussion really? Yeah, so no
*  I get one I get one cold a year in December about December 14th every single year
*  That's just the time it comes. So do you start thinking around December? Yeah
*  Fuck yeah hundred percent. I know it's coming. Maybe mindfuck yourself. Maybe so but my wife knows it's coming
*  She's oh, it's about your time and I get it. That's like a period
*  Yeah
*  So it's a thing where I just feel like, you know, I get that one cold
*  But when I went to the doctor now, I'm like, okay
*  Let me investigate and get a full checkup from the dude that saved my life like everything
*  Yeah to see if there's any underlying. Let me know that's that I'm very curious
*  I I have to think it's the travel
*  I mean especially listening to that schedule flying to New York doing all those shows flying back
*  And of course every time you fly you're tired
*  Yeah
*  You know always you have to get up in the morning get to flight and fly back and the time zones all fucked up and the
*  Fact you went immediately to Vegas and drove for and back in the same day
*  Yeah, oh and then this was at the time where people didn't even wear a mask in the plane
*  You know, of course I wore one because my wife made me she
*  But it didn't help
*  Well, it sounds like we know exactly where you got it. Yeah, it was New York
*  I got those guys that were you were with yeah, so a mess
*  I didn't have a mask when I met my or maybe you gave it to them. I don't think so
*  Yeah
*  I know I didn't have it
*  This is why I know I didn't have it is because the two comics didn't get it and they were with me
*  There and then one flew back with me and the only time they weren't around me and this was the last show of the whole
*  Weekend so I didn't see those comics the day after so I know I got it from them because the other comics didn't get it
*  Well, my friend Sturgill got it when he was traveling Europe. Then when he came home, he's with his wife and kids
*  No one got it. Just him. See I I bet you if he tested his wife for an antipyretic
*  They all tested they didn't have it
*  Hmm at the same time they tested everyone tested, huh?
*  Because my wife thinks she got we got the antibody test. So we're waiting to see oh, she thinks she has the antibodies
*  Well, why didn't anybody test? Why didn't it? It's supposed to take like 15 minutes. Oh, we're not Joe Rogan
*  We got the one where you got to go in and takes two days
*  Swab the nose swab or the finger prick?
*  No, no, they draw your blood. Oh, it's the ant. It's the FDA one
*  So now that's available like at some place down the street from our house, so she went to go get it
*  It's just she couldn't we couldn't find time because the kids, you know, love her around and so when is it we get the results tomorrow?
*  Okay, but I took the I've taken two corona tests. I took one before I came here like three days
*  I've just brushed it off. You're never gonna hear the end of it. I think she did
*  She said oh, yeah, I had a fever for a day and the kids had one for half a day. All right
*  But I think I got that I know I got that strand from New York and it hit me hard man
*  Did I think it's travel? I really do. I'm talking to all my comedian friends
*  Everybody that I've had here that hasn't been traveling like dude. I never felt better in my life
*  Mm-hmm. I feel great because we're not traveling every weekend. Yeah, I think that shit's terrible. I think it's like drinking every weekend
*  I really think it's similar. I think it's like it's like you're beating yourself up and also I'm the guy
*  That will
*  Will do the show leave the club at 1 and then get on the 6 a.m. And that's what I did too
*  Well, I did Wendy Williams. So I flew out that night, but usually the two weeks before that I
*  Do the late show fly out first flight out because I want to be with my family
*  I did the exact same thing and that's what I did in Florida and then literally you're laying around all day going
*  What the fuck did I do to myself? Right and you feel horrible the whole day
*  Exactly, you can't even function exactly where I think I'm on that new pattern when comedy picks up again
*  It's like yeah, I'm gonna take the three or four o'clock out. I'm gonna take my time
*  Yeah, leaving. Yeah, because I'm worn out and you don't recover
*  Till Monday or Tuesday sometimes when you when you do like four shows or what? Yeah
*  Yeah, I mean if you can get that IV vitamin drip to man. That's a big one. I learned that trick from Chappelle
*  Oh, yeah, I did gigs with him. We
*  We
*  We would be out late and then the next day he's got a nurse that comes to the hotel
*  We're all sitting around talking shit with IVs
*  Like there was a tree like the bag was like like branches of the tree was like Donnell's on one branch
*  I'm on another branch and we're all getting IV vitamin drips in the hotel room
*  Like this is so weird, but it's so effective after you get it. You're like fuck. I feel amazing
*  Is that what got you into him? Yes. Oh wow
*  And then a few of my friends get into it they they do vitamin drips I've heard about it before I
*  Yeah, I'm all for it, you know Jamie and I do it every week we we do every Wednesday
*  we have a nurse comes in here and they give us an NAD drip and
*  An IV vitamin drip. Wait, is the NAD is what we talked about last time. Mm-hmm
*  And he does that shit that lengthens your telomeres. Yeah, how does does that make you feel any different great?
*  I'm a hundred percent in believe that it's made a big difference you you feel the same. Yeah
*  It works. It does something. Yeah, dr. Davidson Claire had been here and from Harvard and he explained it to us
*  What NAD does and NMN which is a precursor to NAD you could take that and pill form as well
*  Now is the NAD a slow drip? Does it take longer? Well
*  You you could do it slow or you could do it fast, but if you do it fast it's really painful
*  You do it fast, don't you? I do
*  I do it wide open. It takes 13 minutes. Usually supposed to take two hours
*  What kind of pain you going through? It's not good
*  Jamie do you go wide open? Not well not wide, but I've been doing in like 35 40 minutes. It's
*  Uncomfortable, what does it feel like like your guts your guts are on fire?
*  It feels like you swallowed hot sauce or something like you're in agony. Yeah
*  It's not doesn't feel good
*  If you do it over a long period you barely feel it at all the first time we did it
*  She goes do you want to do it fast or slow? I go let's do it pretty fast
*  And so she did it at one hour and I'm like, oh, it's kind of uncomfortable, but it's not that big a deal
*  It's like everything else man when people tell me about the swab like oh my god, the swab is so awful
*  It's so awful. It's not it's like it's just you get it in there. It's like
*  Weird for a second. Not that big a deal. Yeah that big a deal, but the
*  IV nad it when you do it what I do is I have them open it wide up
*  so the bag drains in 13 minutes and
*  And
*  Beast just but it's 13 minutes versus an whether you an hour of feeling like shit or 13 minutes are really
*  Feeling like shit. I'll take the 13. Okay after the 13 minutes, though
*  Is it done like the pain just goes away as soon as the drip is done exactly exactly
*  It lasts like an extra couple of minutes and then I do the IV vitamin bag after that and that's nice and that's nothing
*  That literally nothing
*  Dude, that's beast. My friend was telling me about that. Yeah. Yeah, if you should try it, it feels real weird
*  Like the people that told me about it like it feels like your guts are on fire
*  I'm like, how is that possible? It's but it's an IV like what is it?
*  But it's just like you feel it in your chest just feels really uncomfortable
*  This is what it feels like if I could show you right here ready
*  For 13 minutes just yeah suck it up open it wide up I try it like I tried it first I go open that wide up
*  Let me feel that's like
*  I
*  Think I could take this
*  Is it instant like you as soon as they open it up you felt that? Oh, yeah right away because the drips going like this
*  They just flown into your veins, you know
*  Uh-uh. No, I would be the I would be the hour hour and a half, dude. I can't I'm not no no
*  No, no, I when stuff goes in me, yeah, I I'm scared I hear David Goggins going stay
*  Don't be a pussy open it up open it up
*  It's not I would rather go to 13. I always mock Jamie, but Jamie goes pretty fast
*  Yeah, now that okay, so it's my explanation of it is it's like a little exponentially it goes up that
*  2530 minute range sucks, but any faster than that it sucks hard like I start feeling at my fingers
*  It's a big suck. It was like it sucked
*  So when you open that bitch wide and you do the 13 minute jammy 13 minutes is as fast as I can do it
*  I told her and then I also put the
*  The the tree the fucking pole where the IVs hang I put it on a table so it's more drag gravity
*  Oh great. So to go even faster is 13 minutes the fastest it can go as it can go. Yeah
*  But it's just it's just pain I want to feel it too. I want to know what it feels like like
*  It's a miles I play a little mind game myself
*  I mean, it's your thing. I respect you. I want to have control over
*  What what I?
*  assign to sensations
*  So does it does the pain lessen every time you do it or is it no no no you don't build up a towel
*  No, I get nervous every week every week right before I do it. I'm like fuck here we go
*  And I just kept myself in the mindset and then once it's happening it's just happening, okay
*  I watched Jerry Seinfeld this time that distracted the shit out of me
*  Tiger King distracted the shit out of me. Did you like Tiger King? Yes, I love
*  It's amazing to me how some people just live yeah, like that's so disconnected. Yeah
*  Special type of
*  Person that is like really into those goddamn big cats, too
*  Like that was one thing that I got out of that like there's a special type of person
*  That's into like having big cats in their backyard and shit. Have you ever messed with a cat? No
*  Oh, yeah, don't look at that. I had it's a little fucking baby cat. I was scared as fuck of that thing
*  I told you how I cry that thing
*  Through a blanket over it or whatever it was yeah, I just I just find when you give certain people lots of land
*  They'll do crazy shit to it
*  Gun range yeah my friend has this ranch in Austin, Texas
*  In the middle of nowhere, and he always asked me to go they got guns they show they blow up cars
*  They use dynamite
*  So Texas they ride horses and I'm like no because I can't see myself and I'm a worry rat
*  I can see myself going there and getting shot on accident like they're that they drink they shoot guns
*  They drink and then shoot them blowing up cars when they're drunk like that's them. He has a lot of money, so
*  He just gets used cars. No one's gonna feel bad if he dies that way. Hey, he's a good friend
*  Well
*  He parties hard if you drink and shoot guns and something goes wrong people like well
*  What do you think was gonna happen? Yeah? He has a helicopter
*  What does this guy do for a living I don't want to say
*  You don't want to say well well now. He's an oil business. Oh there you go, Texas
*  So like I just see them in a copter
*  Drinking like this is on he sends me the video and then shooting a car it blows up
*  Texas is a special place
*  That's real freedom. They don't give a fuck down there. No they don't
*  Austin, Texas where my friend Adam lives Adam Curry. He's already eaten at restaurants
*  He sent me this is like before I went to Florida
*  He sent me a message said he went to a restaurant. They didn't wear a mask everybody's eating normal like isn't it crazy
*  How quickly that went away? Oh?
*  Yeah, well I think I think people now are just accepting people are gonna die
*  Like if the president just came out and say look a lot of people gonna die, but us for to us to get back
*  We need to go out so it's almost like herd immunity
*  Yeah
*  But if you say something like that people are gonna go crazy like how callous are you to say it you can't say it that way
*  They won't go crazy. You know why because right now in America
*  It's so divided where no matter what Trump says liberals gonna go nuts his base
*  Fine with it. You know so it's gonna be the same we would think people say that but if someone in your family
*  Does something and then goes out and dies because that's happening now. That's happening now
*  What do you mean people are going out with no mask and they're catching stuff and then 80,000 people are dead
*  So that's somebody's families those people are in
*  Right I want to know and he's saying people that are dying. What are the extenuating circumstances?
*  How many of them are old so I read something?
*  I need to know if this is true someone said that the Google this the average age of people who've died from the coronavirus
*  Is older than the average age that people die?
*  Hmm I haven't heard that yeah, but I've heard that I've heard 60 and up
*  I was on the way out the door. I was like God. I gotta remember to look at that
*  I heard I've read stuff like I said, there's so many different stories out there, but I've heard that corona
*  Are killing people a decade before they're supposed to die, but yeah when you say that though. That's when you're that old
*  Anything can kill you absolutely right when you're 75 years old and you get the flu you have a very high likelihood
*  You're gonna die. It's much higher than if you're 35 years old you get the flu
*  That's like with everything you know so what are we gonna do when the flu comes around are we gonna change our behavior?
*  Are we going to?
*  Isolate and social distance each other when the flu is around the difference with the flu you have a vaccine
*  You sometimes have some time scene yeah, but at least there's comfort yes
*  There's something to the shot exactly yeah, but what corona you don't have that yet
*  So and the problem is it just started mm-hmm
*  You know so you have no answers and literally a new strain could come out
*  They don't even know if it mutates yet. You know they saying it doesn't well
*  They think it does it does they think that in India they have a completely different strain that will if they come up with a
*  Vaccine for the the coronavirus that we have here
*  It won't be effective on the coronavirus that they have in India see I mean so it like there's so many things
*  That's it's just not known. That's what makes it scary to people and that's why so miss and from so I was to say here
*  table from the CDC's
*  Updated as of I guess this is last week, okay, but this is not what I'm looking for
*  I'm gonna be too too broad no one's written that article though. I don't know how they're to find it though. Yeah
*  No one wrote that article. I mean I can't find like that specific question
*  Did you ask it that way the average age of people dying from coronavirus is older than the average age that people die
*  It's that and this is the article that comes up, so it says 85 years 13,000 75 to 84
*  12,000 65 to 74 9,000
*  Yeah
*  The cover the cover does in this column so the average age people die is somewhere in the range of 75
*  It's a 78.54 and I typed it in so 78.54 is when people die
*  So 75 to 84 years old would be the average age people die and that's 12,000 people over 85 is
*  13,000 people so that's the vast majority of people
*  The larger number of people is the 75 to 84 to 85 year old
*  Yeah, five plus year old so that that does make sense that is correct then
*  Wow, I keep staring at that 45 to 54 numbers said it could have been two two six three
*  It's it's relatively small yeah the younger people and then when you get to 15 to 24
*  There's only been 48 deaths
*  Five to fourteen four deaths one to four two deaths under four under one four deaths, so yeah
*  So I mean it's not good when anybody dies in any disease
*  But this is it is interesting and it points to the immune system it points to
*  Whether or not your immune system can fight it off. Yeah, I
*  Let me tell you I'm saying like I'm doing the drips. I'm gonna get a drip later this week
*  I had one a couple weeks ago because I've always been in the trip eat
*  Do you eat well?
*  Oatmeal in the morning. Yeah, what do you eat? Well I wake up eat oatmeal in the morning
*  Not really avocado avocado is pretty good for yeah, just carbs. Okay, and then I'm just telling you what I
*  And then for lunch I eat the same thing every day I have a turkey bowl
*  It's just turkey rice and beans and then
*  For dinner, I'll have a salad flavor
*  Yeah, I'm not in I'm not a foodie really at all like I don't like yeah
*  I'm like a robot. I could eat the same thing every single day
*  I do eat the same thing every single day really yeah
*  Maybe that's your problem eating the same thing boring ass bullshit food
*  And then I eat a salad at night with like fish or chicken or something like that
*  I am boring
*  My wife is like you want to order a pizza tonight?
*  I'll switch it up when she wants to eat, but as far as me, but like in college
*  I did that you know like you wake up in the morning when you play college football you eat this
*  Afternoon you eat this like I was on creatine like we were a testicle for creatine
*  So they gave us that six times a day, but you had to stay on this certain diet again
*  Like almost 60 pounds and like a year creatine put some weight on you made my face fat. Yeah
*  It was oh Samoan. Yeah, I turned Samoan
*  Oh Samoan yeah, I turned Samoan
*  We retain so much water. That's the interesting thing about when I did the carnivore diet. I did the carnivore diet
*  I wound up losing I think somewhere around 13 pounds in a month, and I got ripped
*  I got really shredded, but also your muscles get smaller like everything got smaller
*  My face got smaller everything got smaller because your body's retaining less water because you don't have glucose in your system
*  You don't have as much glycogen. It's different. You're not eating carbohydrate
*  I wasn't eating any carbohydrates. Okay, so since I'm sorry what oatmeal what should I be starting with?
*  I mean there's nothing wrong with oatmeal. I mean oatmeal's fine. You just shit on my oatmeal
*  There's not a lot of nutrients in it. Yeah, okay. It's it's good carbohydrates
*  Yeah, oatmeal's with blueberries is a good way to get started when do you like to work out?
*  Do you work out in the morning? As soon as I wake up soon as you wake up. I drink first and then work out
*  No, I drink
*  three
*  cups of water
*  Workout, I mean three cups of water then I have
*  Little shake with that layered stuff. Mm-hmm the superfood. Mm-hmm. So I have that and then I work out. Oh, that's good
*  Yeah, that's not bad. Yeah, I mean this little something something
*  I've done both I do
*  Fasted exercise so I'll not eat for 16 hours
*  And then I get up in the morning and now either run or I'll do yoga or on a crazy day
*  I'll do both I'll run with the dog for an hour and then I'll go and do a yoga class for an hour and a half
*  No food, but I'm pretty wrecked by the time the yoga class is over
*  Yeah, I I sometimes do the fast thing too and I'll run and then I'll go work out and I feel great
*  But if you get through it, you feel so good. Mm-hmm. Like and you feel like you did something. Yeah, you did something
*  No, you really did some you struggled the struggles real what I like is fruit
*  Before I work out it seems like that's the like today. I had some bananas and then I did some kickboxing
*  I feel like there's something about fruit where it's not heavy
*  It's not gonna fuck with my date
*  Like if I'm working out really hard and I'm digesting food, it feels like shit feels terrible
*  But for me oranges apples fruit some blueberries, that's nice
*  It gives me just a little bit of sugar a little bit just to get me going
*  I'll drink some coffee and then I can get a good workout in and it's just enough fuel to power me through a workout
*  I've tried both ways. I definitely could work out harder when I have some fuel. I
*  Was watching TV this happened a couple weeks ago and I started laughing because all
*  That popped into my head was you when they released the footage of those UFOs
*  Joe Rogan is gonna talk about this the next day
*  I'm so happy. I
*  Love it, but wasn't that released like a year ago? Well, it was leaked
*  There was in the Pentagon finally, but look in the middle of the pandemic
*  What a great time to just admit there's UFOs because I one of the things that I said on my Instagram
*  I was like in any of the time in history if the government came out and said there are flying saucers that defy our
*  understanding of propulsion and physics the world will go crazy but in 2020 people like
*  Like nothing has anybody seen those pilots. Well, I've had one of them on here. Oh, so he's a believer
*  Yeah
*  Doctor commander David Fravor
*  I had him on the podcast and he was explaining the whole thing to me like his experience off the coast of San Diego
*  Running into one of these things. I mean, there's people that are debunkers, but they need to understand. This is not just
*  visual they they had very
*  Specific like actual real data including radar. They track these things
*  They use sophisticated military tracking. These are real objects
*  This is not like there's a lot of dummies out there that want to debunk everything
*  And they're just as much of a religious person as someone who bull who's a true believer
*  They're a true believer that everything can be explained
*  Well, not everything can be explained and these things can't be explained when the when they're explaining how these things traveled at these
*  they went from
*  Like six feet off the ground of 60,000 feet in a matter of a couple of seconds
*  they fly in some way that these
*  Military aircraft pilots can't explain they don't understand it and they don't know what they are now whether they're from another planet
*  That's never been proven. They might be interdimensional. They might be something from here
*  They might be some super sophisticated top of the food chain
*  top secret stuff that they're exposing these people to just so they freak out and like let's let's see if they can
*  Get a you know get an explanation for this
*  Let's launch these things and have them fly past people at these preposterous rates of speed and see what the reaction is
*  Do you think those those type of secrets if there are are higher than the president?
*  Do you really do you think there's an organization that's above president's 100% 100%? Here's why?
*  Presidents come and go yeah every four years. We're gonna trust some dipshit who wins a popularity contest
*  Trump's a perfect example of that. Here's a guy who's not even a politician
*  lifelong
*  Businessman who wins a popularity contest gets to be in the most powerful office most powerful position
*  Really the world's ever known president United States commander-in-chief of the greatest army this entire planet has ever seen
*  You're gonna tell him you tell Trump. I mean think they go the great. He believes Obama's from Kenya
*  He believes a lot of you believe that but you know look you see those birth certificates. It's like yeah
*  Well, is this real?
*  And by the way Obama's
*  When he was in college his
*  publicist for
*  His whatever book he was publishing or whatever I forget what it was but wrote down as in his bio born in Kenya
*  So it wasn't just a couple of people was literally somebody was working with Obama
*  Wrote down that he was born in Kenya does that mean he was born in Kenya
*  It doesn't it might mean that the publicist thought it would be cool to say I was born in Kenya
*  Cuz it make wow this guy's gone so far and look at him now. He's at Harvard. He was born in Kenya
*  It's it makes for a better story. It makes for a better story
*  Yeah, so you have to take all the possibilities into consideration
*  You know, but anyway, Oh Trump was a he was that was his thing. He was a birther, right?
*  Yeah, he believes a lot of wacky shit and and if you gave him access to that
*  He would have definitely told us stuff by now
*  Carter said that he would he said that he'd actually seen UFO and that if he got into the office
*  He would tell everybody and he got into office and then say shit
*  Didn't say shit. I really think when people go in there man
*  Like if you're president they say this is what we can keep you alive on if you talk about this
*  We can't we can't protect you
*  Like I honestly think they they have that conversation
*  Well, if you look at what Obama said before he got into office versus what he did when he got an office is two possible
*  scenarios one
*  He got an office and then he got compromised and he became corrupt and he became a part of the system
*  to
*  his understanding
*  When he was running for president of what the how the world really works is
*  Vastly different than how the world actually works and then once you get in there you realize that the huge spectrum of threats
*  To the United States and to people that are coming from all around the world all the time and what needs to be done to mitigate
*  These threats I'm more inclined to believe the latter. I think it's more like that
*  I think I think you have these idealistic perspectives that once you get into office
*  They get sort of dashed and you go. Holy shit. You're like, oh everybody wants that's why they all look old, too
*  I think the pressure that they're like, what the fuck I
*  Think the whole world's barely keeping it together every day every day of the year barely keeping it together
*  You got like this fucking
*  Libya's a failed state and they're having slave auctions on YouTube and you've got Isis is plotting
*  these fucking
*  These attacks here and this group and Boko Haram is doing this and fucking al Qaeda is doing that
*  Taliban and uh
*  all day
*  China's doing this and North Korea's got that and ah
*  I think every fucking president deals with a new
*  series of potential terrorist attacks a new series of
*  Religious fanatics that want to blow things up and kill people and you've got white
*  Nationalists that are going to Christchurch, New Zealand shooting people at a mosque. It's like all day long
*  You've got madness and if you're the one person that won the popularity contest and all sudden you're sitting in the fucking
*  control room and they're explaining everything to you like
*  the situation room with wolf butcher
*  Come on man breaking news every time they come up breaking news breaking anything. It's madness. It's madness. That's what I think
*  I think all day long. It's madness. Yeah, it's it's scary, man
*  It's scary like I think they keep Trump in the dark
*  They feed him at all and let him watch keeping up with the Kardashians and it's just
*  Just tweets about people he's mad at how I'm lemon you piece of shit he gets mad at people
*  I mean how crazy is this that our president just tweets all the tweet I think over the weekend 126 times or retweets, bro
*  I don't even have time to tweet
*  You know when I if I it's so rare that I tweet something most of my tweets come from Instagram
*  I'll post a picture on Instagram and that gets tweeted. That's that's it most of the time if I tweet once in a day
*  It's a lot. That's a crazy day. I wonder if somebody runs. Do you think somebody runs his account?
*  Yeah, you think it's actually him. Yes, I do. Yes, I do. Yes, I do
*  I don't see a lot of because I'm not positive
*  But I really believe that because I think that if you look at his pattern before he was ever president
*  That's how he did. Yeah, he always he's always just talk shit. It's the way he gets the word out and it's
*  You know, it's real controversial man
*  I mean because some of the things that he says like he's threatening people like he's threatened North Korea with with missiles and shit
*  Did you think that dictator was dead when that came out? I was open
*  I was hoping he's dead because I want to see what happens if his sister takes over
*  So that'd be fun. She has my name. Yo, that was pretty cool
*  Because I am Korean it's all like yeah
*  We got a yo in the house got a yo in the house
*  Yeah
*  I was I was thinking but apparently Jamie said that the story is that he faked his own death
*  So that he could find out who the traders were
*  Good plan makes sense makes sense to me. Yeah, and if you look at him, like he says heart attack like okay, look at him
*  Yeah, I mean fucker looks like he's ready for a heart attack. Well, then that must also mean
*  He's threatened in some way to where there's some there's some
*  Fucking dictator. Yeah every day. It's like think of the horrible shit. He's done. He killed his own uncle, right?
*  He had his own uncle killed and his brother. Yeah and his brother and it the uncle's brother, right or his brother
*  No his I believe he got it. That's the airport one where he killed his brother in an airport. He had him
*  They gave him some poison or something
*  Allegedly, I guess yeah, I don't know about that. But didn't he he killed someone with a missile. Oh, yeah blew him up
*  Yeah, I think it was his uncle. Yeah, he shot his uncle with a missile
*  So anyone knows you do a poll and then fucking hid behind a rock
*  Like like anyone I guess that could take power or in the realm of taking power he got rid of him
*  Yeah, they said that I can't I don't know their numbers
*  But let's say 13 people were like his father's crew
*  Like only two of them survived the rest the other 11 through like disappeared
*  Well, you got to think once he assumes power and people realize like this guy's just born into power
*  And there's probably a lot of people plotting against him a lot of military people plotting against him
*  And that's a dark country where they all plot against each other and they all rat on each other
*  It's built into the system, you know that they're all supposed to tattletale on each other
*  I I just feel like you know, like this dude came in like a football coach. He's like I'm firing everybody
*  I'm gonna have my own team instead of firing people. He just killed him
*  That's what they do over there
*  Man, I don't know but my mom she's from South Korea. She's like she's always asked. Oh, it's North Korea
*  We're gonna do something the South Korea. She's like no like people from there seem as no threat
*  That's what's crazy. It's a sad country
*  Yeah, sad and a lot of the reason why it's the way it is is the United States interference
*  Mm-hmm
*  you know, I mean if you look at the history of North Korea like how it got started and
*  Why they became this horrific military military dictatorship you can kind of trace a good chunk of it to
*  American policy. Mm-hmm and what we did in Korea during the Korean War
*  It's fucking crazy shit. Yeah, it's it's this world
*  Man, it's just nuts. Like I don't know if you saw the video of that kid that was jogging a mod. Yes
*  I mean what is going on? Like I'm not surprised. I can say I'm not surprised like something with it
*  It's a guy in the back of the pickup truck with a shotgun
*  The other guy jumps out and he's trying to grab the shotgun from them. They shoot him like what?
*  My thing is how do we have laws?
*  That say that you could chase somebody with guns
*  And here's the thing if you notice in the video the truck is in front of them
*  So they chase them got in front of them the guy that's running behind them
*  It's almost like like a mod was trapped a guy chasing you with a camera
*  The truck was already pulled up. So it was certainly trapped. I mean this chased him down and it's
*  Vigilant is even look even if he did something
*  Mean, I don't even know if he did anything. No, he said he was just running but no, there's actually photograph
*  There's videos of him walking into a house being built like it's just wood inside, right?
*  He looked at it what I told my wife. I would do that shit when I was a kid me too
*  I was telling my wife we just did that the other day
*  They're building a house and we just oh, let's see where this is and and then he jogs on right didn't steal anything
*  Didn't have anything just jogging now
*  how do we come to a point in our country where two men can chase him down with guns and
*  Then get in a fight with them and then say it was self-defense
*  Well, I think Georgia has some crazy laws citizens arrest and also they have ties to law enforcement
*  Yes, the father was with the DEA and then the prosecutor the local prosecutor
*  Wrote this letter that said basically he burglarized the kid Ahmad burglarized something which he didn't and
*  They had every right to pull him over and when he didn't stop they got in a fight
*  and so they had every right to kill him, so now the
*  The government came in like the big dogs came in and then they arrested the people in two days
*  And it was just like ah
*  We don't think so and here's a thing social media out
*  It did it did took the outrage of people finding out about the case
*  But when I found out that it happened months ago, oh 223
*  February 20, I mean February 23 months these guys were out and they knew that they had shot him and then here's
*  No, it had the video. Here's it's really crazy. The video was released by their own lawyer
*  You know why cuz they thought it showed that the guy tried to take the gun away look
*  It's gonna free you. I'm doing the southern accent
*  Well release the video and then everyone's gonna know that dude released a video and this is what I heard
*  He released that it helped helped them because the guy didn't stop when they tried to pull him over
*  imagine being a
*  25 year old black man and two white guys in the back of a pickup truck with shotguns pull over and there's no one else around
*  Holy what was the kid supposed to do just stop and talk to two men with guns exactly
*  It's it's and then and then I was listening to reports like before this video even came out
*  Here's what's crazy is the police had the video at the beginning and they still dismissed it they had this at the beginning
*  They didn't release it the lawyer released it like you said so they had it at the beginning
*  That the lawyer thought that that was gonna help his clients
*  You know what? I think and I don't know much about the person that shot it, but if I'm guessing everybody's throwing out
*  Okay, I think he shot the video whoever this guy was it's almost like a hero video. Look at this
*  We caught a guy that burglarized like they felt like oh, this and then the guns start going off. Yeah, holy fuck. Yeah, maybe
*  And then the
*  Vigilantism is scary man, because people just decide that they're right and they decide that this is the this is the person and no due process
*  No trial none. You're pulling up with shotguns drawn like cops don't even do that, man
*  They turn the lights on first they pull you over they start talking to don't pull the gun out right away when you just jog in
*  Well some cops do I mean this happened before a lot of video that to video that too. So I but I do think I mean
*  It's deep south. I mean it's warm territory hook warm. It's it's it's racism
*  I think racism led it to you know, well, it's very likely
*  Yeah, it's very the very least it has to be considered as one of the main
*  Components of this sort of interaction. Absolutely. I just feel that you know, anytime you bring up race
*  You'll have the audience that goes. Oh, you got to bring up race
*  But this was a black guy that got shot by two white guys with shotguns, let's take away race
*  Let's say the two guys shot a white guy that was jogging. It's still wrong. Yeah
*  It's you know, it's still wrong. Even if you take the potential racism out take it out
*  You got a 25 year old just kid is out jogging
*  Yeah, these guys pull up with shotguns and tell them to you know, hey, we want to talk to you like fuck
*  Well, you've heard this some people don't even think racism is real. They're like, oh, there's no racism in America
*  I mean I've racist people
*  But anybody who doesn't believe it well, it's like saying sexism isn't real
*  But they don't think it's big as it is
*  You know like you said something at the Comedy Store and it may have been in one of your specials
*  Where you were talking about something and you said that's only four people ago
*  Yeah, the United States
*  1776 yeah, that's only four people go three people go three people go so if you think about that, right?
*  Three people go people own people own people so you were racist and then your kids were racist
*  Yeah, my dad is that third level being black had to go through racism
*  So we're still in it. It can't go away that fast
*  It takes a long time to go away when you've got the roots of it
*  That's still deeply embedded in these cities, right?
*  Like yeah, this is like Baltimore Georgia red lines where you weren't even allowed to sell a home to someone who was black in
*  Certain districts. Yeah, it was illegal. Oh
*  Man my dad has a PhD in nuclear physics and went to a college where he couldn't even eat at restaurants on campus and
*  Where was that? He went to Oklahoma State
*  At certain restaurants on campus
*  What year is this? Well, he's 75
*  so
*  60s
*  So during the civil rights all the riots and he led
*  My dad was in marches to try to get the local restaurant to let him in so it's a thing where I when people go
*  Racism isn't that bad. My dad is only 75, right? Right, and he went through it during his life during his lifetime
*  So and this is when and this is when my dad was telling me when he was growing up
*  This is how crazy my dad said he didn't even know he was poor
*  Growing up because they never left the area. They couldn't go anywhere
*  He never knew they were poor
*  He never saw white people because they weren't allowed to go anywhere anyway, so he never knew they were in poverty
*  You know I was reading this horrible story about even after slavery was abolished one of the things that they would do was they would capture
*  Black men for loitering and forced them into going into labor camps
*  So they would literally enforce slavery but do slavery by having them in prison
*  And forcing them to do labor now when I'm the reason why I bring this up right now
*  There was a garbage strike
*  Garbage workers strike and so they brought in prisoners. They kicked find out where this is they this is
*  I'm not I don't remember where it was but I was reading I was like what in the fuck
*  So these guys the garbage men made $10 an hour
*  They fired all the striking garbage men and brought in prisoners to do this
*  Here it is prison labor replaces striking garbage workers in New Orleans
*  Stop and think about that. They said you know what you you want more than $10 an hour. I got a better idea
*  We'll get people to do it for free so they're essentially
*  Reigniting slavery in New Orleans when it comes to taking care of garbage. Yeah, I mean
*  It's still around but the fact that they think that's okay that this is like well
*  Yeah, and the fact that you don't think someone should get more than $10 an hour to fucking take care of people's garbage
*  That's it's insane. It's insane and bringing in
*  Literally slaves. Yeah, well they shouldn't have done that
*  They would be paid only 13% of what garbage makers so the good garbage workers who are only making
*  $10.25 an hour, so they're gonna get 13% of that which is what is that?
*  Is that I got buck 50 it's lower than that. It's like 75 cents, right? It's about a dollar probably dollar fuck
*  Fuck I
*  Mean that's just modern-day slavery
*  It is slavery yeah, I mean giving them a dollar
*  That's insane, but some people would say you know their inmates. They did wrong. That's right hold on
*  But we'll go scroll back up there listen to this metro services group has a law has long been an advocate
*  of helping persons who had been
*  Incarcerated return to society in a meaningful and productive way said the city sent a chase and services in a statement
*  Metro makes no apologies for this policy as a core element of our commitment to being good corporate citizens
*  Under state rules prison inmates employed by metro services would be paid only 13% of what garbage workers make
*  fuck
*  What does that mean?
*  That is that that is so that is so crazy. It's weird because there's no end of the quotation marks
*  Did this actually did it go through how long is it happening? Oh?
*  This is happening. I thought I see use of inmates garbage workers say they will continue to strike in New Orleans
*  They have built widespread community
*  They've built widespread community spreads from unions and community groups, but still
*  That doesn't make any sense. They have built
*  widespread community spreads
*  From unions and communities, but what a weird sentence from unions and community groups
*  But still the city has refused to meet them and discuss their safety concerns
*  So they have a lot of support from unions in the community yeah, but they won't meet with them still oh
*  I see they
*  They've built widespread community
*  I think they want to say have built widespread community support support yeah unions and community groups yeah
*  They wrote spreads instead of support
*  I think and said that they're they aren't trying to hear us says woods. They don't care about us
*  They would let anything happen
*  See I mean
*  If they were sick, we don't care. They don't care if we spread the disease. They just don't care
*  Yeah, I mean just a human being making $10 an hour to do a full-time job is fucking insane
*  It's insane and a grown man in a union
*  That can't get more than $10 an hour how fucking crazy is that this is this is what we're living in and I often wonder
*  You know I always think about your three people go and I go how long is it gonna take how many people?
*  From us right is it gonna take you know I'm like maybe five maybe six if the world is still around well
*  Because there will always be racism some racism not
*  Necessarily always because we could get to a point where there were indistinguishable right yes, I get you
*  You know they'll find another they'll find something else
*  It'll be classism classism or it'll be it'll be a financial thing or an intelligence thing you know unless
*  Unless they get to genetic and engineering
*  Unless genetic engineering reaches a point where literally there is no
*  Disparity in human beings in terms of intelligence looks all those things, but what is that gonna be like yeah?
*  There's always gonna be competition. There's always gonna be weirdness right there's always you know
*  There's always gonna be those women that can bounce back from pregnancy quicker
*  There's always gonna be men like you know super geniuses were knuckleheads like us or scratching our head
*  How the fuck did they even think of that?
*  I always think that every time I talk to Elon every time I have that dude in here
*  I'm like life isn't fair. How's it fair?
*  I'm so much dumber than him and I sit down to talk to him
*  It's like him talking to a chimp like you know it's like he's talking to a toddler like you can lift more weights
*  Oh, I'll fuck him up
*  There you go, sorry how to kill him, but
*  He's so much smarter than me like it's not even close. He's a large man, too. He's bigger than me, too. He's
*  the world's not fair right and
*  Unless we figure out a way to make it fair which is almost you can't you can't is going to be prejudice
*  There's only to be disparity. There's going to be
*  Some people look one thing that I talked to him about Elon. I thought was really interesting
*  He's got this new thing that he's working on called neural link and this neural link is going to rapidly
*  increase our ability to access information and he literally said we're going to be able to communicate without talking and
*  I had talked about this on the podcast before that we're going to be able to read each other's minds
*  And I've said this like what do we want that stoned as a joke?
*  It's not a matter of what we want you think the chimps were like do you you know one day?
*  We're going to have cars that pollute the earth the chimps like do we want that?
*  They didn't sit around think that do I get a gun fuck? Yeah?
*  I'm going to go to the fucking Michigan capital and with my gun yeah, you know I mean this is
*  Just what happens whether or not we want that this is what happens and what he's saying is essentially that one day
*  with this neural link you're going to have
*  Incredibly boosted powers of
*  Cognition you're going to be a different thing than you are now, so my take on it was okay
*  Well, what would be the different goes well?
*  You'd have so much more access to resources you would be able to get so much more done
*  You'd be so much more product productive so what I was saying is but what about the people can't afford this the people that can
*  Afford it would get so far ahead that the people you know like before cell phones were around remember
*  Do you remember the movie?
*  Wall Street yeah, of course right do you remember Michael Douglas walking around with that stupid?
*  Yep, he was walking around that big old brick like and we're like guys guys a baller. He's on the beach. He's still talking
*  Now
*  Everybody can do that yeah, right, but there was a long period of time
*  You know years where only wealthy people had cell phones all the time now everyone does but by if neural link happens and
*  some wealthy people have this insane access to resources and the same insane bandwidth and this ability to communicate without words
*  Long before people like you or I get it if those billionaires get it first
*  They're gonna be able to be they'll be so far ahead of us and who says they have to share it right and then forget about
*  Us what about really poor people they're gonna be fucked. They're gonna be like these goddamn garbage workers
*  They're this scratch and trying to get more than ten dollars an hour and people like fuck you will will use slaves
*  Literal slaves well then that goes to your racism thing it becomes a classism thing yes
*  It comes a class so there's always gonna be something yep. You know what I mean, but
*  To me when hate is involved with it
*  You know I think that's where we should draw the line
*  But that's that's more of where I'm going is like how many people from us like where it's just you don't just kill
*  Random people jogging down the street. You know it's hard
*  It's it's hard to imagine that that still goes on today, right?
*  But then when you hear about your dad and that your dad went to college in a place where he couldn't eat the same
*  Places as white people you're like what on campus on campus. Yeah campus in his lifetime
*  It's changing. It's getting better right that doesn't exist today, and this is what I don't like and I some black people
*  I don't want to say just black people, but some black people when they go ah
*  You know my dad hears this and he always gets mad about it
*  He goes when they when some black people go it's no better than it was way back in the day
*  But that goes excuse me
*  You're 25 years old saying that I went through the shit right it is a lot better a lot
*  I'm in my house. I can go to any restaurant. I want you know that interracial relationship doesn't mean anything anymore
*  No, I mean to most people to most people most people don't care at all, and that's the whole thing is that my dad is like
*  Some black people discredit the whole journey because they try to just say ah it's just like it was before no no
*  Yes, not read any of Steven Pinker's work mm-hmm Steven Pinker
*  Really really brilliant guy and one of the things that he gets criticized for is showing how much less violent
*  The world is today how much less crime there is how much less rape how much less murder
*  and this is essentially the safest place the safest time ever in human history and and people like you're just
*  Discrediting all of the horrors that happen is like no not no not I'm not I'm not dismissing all the terrible things that happen in
*  The world but we're saying even though those things do exist they exist in a far less frequent time
*  Far less far less frequently than did a hundred years ago two hundred years ago and anytime throughout human history
*  There's a trend and that trend is that society is getting safer people are getting nicer and people are getting they're getting better
*  Well, yeah, we're growing and learning well. I also think now like I'm from my family my dad side
*  I'm the first person that dealt with
*  Like I would say I deal with racism
*  But not on the scale my dad dealt with it not and my dad didn't deal with it on the scale his father
*  My grandfather dealt with it
*  So it's kind of like and I'm teaching my kids not to be that way
*  So I feel like these kids that are young growing up. They're gonna be so much more sensitive
*  Towards other people. Yeah, then we were for sure because we were still I wouldn't say like in it in it
*  But we were in it like in my household. You know what I mean like my dad
*  You know would tell me stories of what happened to him and I was like, wow you went through that
*  But I went to a school in Houston, Texas where I stood out my parents were the only
*  Mixed couple I was the only mixed kid at our school
*  I think I believe because I didn't it wasn't even a thing, you know, like people go you look different
*  Like what I like kids would come up to me and go what are you and I was like mom
*  What am I my dad was like tell me black and Asian, you know, so it's it's what I was
*  But nobody on my block were interracial is either black couples or white couples and my parents were like
*  Like before the trend, you know, and it's a thing where I saw what happened to my mom didn't teach me to be
*  My mom didn't teach me anything about my Korean heritage because people made fun of her accent
*  So she didn't want me to go through that so she tried to Americanize me as fast as possible
*  You know my dad he's that I don't give a shit guy, you know
*  He's like there's ignorant people. I don't care. They can say what they want, you know, his favorite word is the n-word
*  You know what? I mean, so he loves to watch movies. My dad is so crazy. He loves to watch movies with the n-word in it
*  Because he says that's real. That's how it really was
*  I think that Leonardo DiCaprio movie with Samuel L Jackson Oh the band of eight or something like that. It was called hatefully hatefully
*  Favorite movie he goes cuz that's how you use the n-word like they said it that normally
*  Like he loves the realness of that, you know, so he's just crazy. He's 75. He's gone through some shit
*  Yeah, it's a different world different world that he went through
*  This is one thing that I when you know people complain about social justice warriors and the
*  ridiculous calling out of everything being racist and everything being sexist and I
*  agree, but
*  The fact that that is the trend that a lot of these young people are going in
*  There's it's too far in a lot of ways, but it'll all balance out like you got to have that sort of overwhelming
*  Left-leaning ideology and then it's overwhelming right-leaning ideology for people to so what is rational?
*  Yeah, what's rational but the trend seems to be in a positive way
*  Like it seems to all be going in a positive way
*  Like it seems to be like racism is way less tolerated amongst most of the people that are in the middle
*  Most of the people that aren't crazy and aren't aren't you know aren't overly sensitive like it seems like things are balancing out
*  Yeah, it's the problem is the older people
*  Yeah, that's where Corona Corona's doing it but not cuz your mom just shook it off. Oh my god
*  shit
*  Like literally talking like you don't understand that conversation. I wish I was there. Oh my god
*  Dad didn't get it. No, you didn't get it. Yeah get an antibody test. No, my dad my dad only been to the doctor once
*  My dad went to the doctor
*  Three years ago. I was having my son me my wife her having her son and I said dad
*  I want you around for my son
*  You need to go to the doctor and get a checkup because every time I go to doctor all my friends go there
*  If you go to a doctor you die like he feels if you see a doctor you're gonna die Jesus Christ, you know
*  So he's like I'm 72 at that time. I'm fine
*  I'm not going to but he decides to go because I beg him to my mom's beat breast cancer twice
*  Throat cancer all types of cancers. My mom goes calls me after his checkup after that
*  She goes nothing's wrong with him. Like she was mad about
*  It
*  How did your mom get throat cancer well she had breast cancer and
*  They you know, they do the scan and they found like the second time
*  I remember we having this big thing because she beat it once I was younger and I really
*  Understand it, you know, I was like nine so you don't grasp it
*  But at 31 really hurt me and she's really into Jesus and I go well that's messed up
*  How to Koreans very very very I mean she's super religious so I said mom how at that time
*  I was a different person. I was like your God, you know gave you breast cancer again
*  How's that good and she goes well if I wouldn't got breast cancer, I wouldn't have known I had throat cancer
*  You know, so she found the positive of it. Whoa. Yeah, so that's the only reason she knew she had throat cancer
*  We like but women God gave you that too. Yeah, fuck
*  She was in a hospital. I don't want to argue
*  But it's a thing where my mom call of he was so funny cuz she was so mad that my dad didn't have something
*  And he's only been tonight in in like I'm 45 now in my 45 years
*  That's the first time he's gone to the doctor and is your dad active? Does he he walks to two hours every day?
*  Oh, that's great on his treadmill and he watches all these Netflix shows. Oh, that's great. Yeah, that's a great way to do it, too
*  Cuz you near on a treadmill you don't even notice what's going on
*  You know, like if you're watching something if you're watching something entertaining like I was saying I was watching Tiger King walls
*  Get an ad drip
*  You don't even know as long as you're watching something
*  I learned that when Ari and Tom and Bert and I did that sober October thing
*  Yeah, like you could get so much more cardio done while you're watching a movie. Absolutely. You don't even notice
*  So my dad walks at two, you know the speed to and he walks for two hours and watches shows
*  So about six months ago, my mom calls me your dad flew off the treadmill
*  So he walks in his underwear I'm finding all this up
*  He walks in his underwear and he accidentally wasn't paying attention and he hit the one before the two
*  Well
*  Whole leg was just shredded like like scars and everything. Oh my god. Oh my god, so I said, you know me
*  I'm a cop. I started sending them
*  emojis of people flying off
*  But he's back on it I was like dad you need to get a stepper something
*  No, I'm a walk so he's back on it though. Wow, he's
*  He's crazy. Like my dad is a no shit type of guy
*  It is what it and he's that dude like when I die die, you know, I don't care where you put me
*  You should get your dad on a podcast. Oh, I'm gonna get my parents on mine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Has your dad been on before?
*  Yeah, but they talk so much shit to each other
*  Like it's amazing like like on my Instagram there's videos of them like they're in an argument
*  My dad is telling my mom that's Korean that Asian people don't know how to drive and they're just arguing about it on the Instagram
*  Oh, yeah
*  It's somewhere on there. It's probably deeper tell people to find it. Well, yeah, it's on there
*  But but my mom is like, yeah Asian people can't drive but Korean people can't he's like that's the same damn thing, you know
*  So that's ever since I was growing up. That's the relationship. That's it's so fun
*  So they've always been talking one uppers their one uppers man. It's so fun
*  It's so funny that you is mad that he didn't have anything wrong with him Oh angry
*  The way she said it Joe the way she said it she goes. Hey, so we got results your dad not sick at all
*  He had nothing wrong with him. I'm like
*  Mom, you should be happy about this. Mmm
*  They're crazy
*  They're crazy. They're crazy, but the world's crazy right now, but I
*  You know, I just I just hope it gets better I just hope we can get I don't sound like Rodney King
*  It's gonna take some time. Yeah, it's gonna take longer than everybody thinks
*  I think everybody thinks it's gonna all clean up real quick and I don't think so
*  I think we're in this for a couple years the corona. Yeah, that's what I think. Yeah 100%
*  but but my thing about opening up the country is
*  It's it's not about you opening up the country
*  I just don't feel in a lot of places people are comfortable even going out
*  Like I wouldn't go to a restaurant in LA right now. I would yeah. Yeah, I think people are gonna get used to it
*  I think people need to for sure need to take care of their immune system
*  Yeah, very important and and people need to educate themselves and we need to understand the value of your health
*  Because for the longest time when we didn't have something like this
*  There's a lot of people that are like barely hanging on health wise and any little thing can set them off
*  But but when I say go to a restaurant, I gotta go with a five month a year old
*  Son like that's what I'm talking about. I'm not talking about me. Yeah, I'm talking about the whole family
*  Yeah, but yeah, I'm not no way would I take a five month old?
*  I think your your real concern for sure is people that have issues
*  That's the real concern and the real concern is coming home like, you know, your mom shook it off
*  But some moms not you know, some some older folks are not going to you know
*  We got to do our best to shield them and hopefully that new rims Dez of here
*  How do you say that shit?
*  Yeah, I'm testing it right now. Yeah, apparently there that is really helping and it's people are recovering 31% faster
*  But it's not stopping you from dying. That's if you're gonna recover it recovers you like if you're I know that's true
*  No, it's true. It's true. It's not stopping you from it's it's basically helping people that would recover anyway
*  Like if if you took 14 days of recovery it channel it changes it to 11
*  What if they get it too early before the virus has a chance I'm just saying what they're saying is not stopping death
*  It's just helping the people that would recover recover faster, which is great. Yeah, cuz they can get back out
*  That's the last I heard but like I said things change all the time what you said about what is this? Oh my god
*  Let's we'll end with this because we're three hours in I'm glad you're okay brother. Thank you
*  And I'm glad we got a chance to do this podcast and let people know and now we're gonna show people how crazy
