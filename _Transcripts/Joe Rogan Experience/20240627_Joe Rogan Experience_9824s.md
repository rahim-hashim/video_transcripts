# Joe Rogan Experience #2059 - Adam Greentree
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc)
*  Hello Joe Rogan. What the fuck's happening? Everything. How are you enjoying my country? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm loving your country. Yeah. It was good. It's good to be back. Yeah, you were here. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=17.64s)]
*  You did another one of those wild back country elk hunts, which you haven't been able to [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=23.36s)]
*  because of COVID for three years. Four years. Four years. Yep. Wow. And five years since the last [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=26.8s)]
*  podcast. Did you document the whole thing like you did the last time in your internet stories? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=32.72s)]
*  I did. Yeah. Yeah. I tried to capture as much as I could. Sometimes it's hard because you're stuck [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  in the moment. So the last thing you want is like a phone in your face, right? It does fuck with it, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=42.4s)]
*  right? Yeah. So I couldn't capture it all, but I tried to at least mention everything that I was [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=47.2s)]
*  going through. But there was like one stage I just felt like I was in the war and I actually [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=52.72s)]
*  slipped between two fallen down trees and I nearly broke my legs like straight across the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=57.68s)]
*  front of my shins. Oh shit. And it's like, I didn't capture it and I'm sort of hurting. So [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=62.32s)]
*  you don't get to see the whole story, but I reckon I at least give the people 80% of the story, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=67.52s)]
*  you know? What happened when you almost broke your legs? Well, I was fucking rooted for starters, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=73.12s)]
*  like stuff like this is day 26 or something like that. What does rooted mean to your people? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=78.48s)]
*  You didn't know what it means, right? Yeah. Really? Just guessing. Rooted means really [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=84.56s)]
*  exhausted. Oh, okay. Like just you're fucked, you know? Right. And I was coming back in the dark, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=88.64s)]
*  you know, you're trying to, you know, conserve everything as you're going. So you're trying to [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=95.04s)]
*  use your headlight as less as possible as well. Like you're out there for a month. Right. So a [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=99.28s)]
*  lot of the times your headlight, yeah, torches turn right down if it's on at all. So it's turned [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=104.56s)]
*  right down and I'm coming back down the mountain to camp, pretty much stepped on one bit of dead [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  fall, like a big fallen pine tree and then slipped off it. And then there was another pine tree, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=114.64s)]
*  only like a foot apart. So I went between the two of them and all my body weight come over the top [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  of it. And then, yeah, like I just remember, I like least bruised the bones because it was hard [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=125.04s)]
*  to walk, you know? Oh boy. But it's like at that point, you feel like the whole world's against [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=130.32s)]
*  you, right? Really, really tough trip. Like, and I think a lot of the over the counter guys went [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=134.72s)]
*  through that this year. It was a really difficult year for Earl. Was that because of the heavy snow [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=140.32s)]
*  fall? So I think because of winter kill for one. And then a lot of the other states are not doing [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=145.76s)]
*  any over the counter anymore. So that pushed more people into Colorado and then Colorado shut down [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=152.48s)]
*  some units and limited units because of the winter kill. So there was a lot of hunters [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=157.92s)]
*  jammed in the areas. I think the bulls didn't come down. So I think a combination of a lot of things. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=163.2s)]
*  Colorado's just reintroduced wolves, which is just, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  it's such a shell game because when there's like stipulations to reintroduce wolves, like [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=174.0s)]
*  Reneal has talked about this before, like they reintroduce wolves. And then the idea is when the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  wolves get to be a certain population, then they will allow hunting. But then the wildlife [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=184.32s)]
*  protection groups come in and they sue to make sure that you don't open up wolf hunting. So then [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  they only can issue depredation permits to ranchers and people don't like the idea of hunting wolves. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=197.68s)]
*  And I get that. But you shouldn't also like the idea of rampant wolf populations that are invading [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=205.76s)]
*  into people's communities and eating their dogs and threatening children. The reason why Big Bad [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=212.0s)]
*  Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood and all that shit, there was a story because they used to eat kids. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=218.08s)]
*  They ate people for a long fucking time until people got wise and said, you know, we should [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=222.08s)]
*  probably kill these fucking things. And that's what they did for the longest time. And then the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=228.24s)]
*  greenies got in like, we need to bring the wolves back. And it's generally people that have zero [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=232.32s)]
*  experience with real wildlife predators. And there should be a balance. There should be grizzly bears. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=238.16s)]
*  There should be mountain lions. It's not like anybody wants to eradicate those things. But [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=243.84s)]
*  reintroducing wolves, especially what they did with Montana, they took those big ass Canadian wolves [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=247.6s)]
*  and brought them down. Well, like you know me, I do think there needs to be a balance. And I think [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=253.44s)]
*  people, hunters, are part of that balance as well. And I think a big part of that is keeping [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=260.48s)]
*  everything in check. So if the elk population is too big, then there should be more tags. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=266.96s)]
*  It's a really good system over here in that sense in America. And then if there's a winner kill, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  like there just has been in this last season, then yeah, limit the tags and things like that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=278.88s)]
*  Because I've been on a few hunts now where you don't feel comfortable shooting an elk because [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=283.52s)]
*  you're not seeing any. So it's just like, shit, I actually don't want to shoot an elk here. It [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  doesn't feel right. It doesn't seem like there's enough elk here for me to be shooting them. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=294.0s)]
*  And I experienced that in a few areas this trip. And I remember the last time I hunted, so four [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=298.96s)]
*  years ago, and Kimmy, my wife, actually said it to me, I think we hunted for 14 days and we hadn't [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=305.92s)]
*  seen a bull elk. And she's like, even if one steps up at this point, I'm not shooting it because it [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=312.64s)]
*  doesn't feel right. And it's true, but there could be lots of elk in that area at another time of [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=318.0s)]
*  the year, but hunting season starts, hunters go in and sort of pushes them out. So it's a little [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=323.68s)]
*  bit hard to say, but yeah, you don't feel right. You want to shoot something that's in a good, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=327.52s)]
*  healthy population. And now considering the fact that you are getting these over the counter tags, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=331.52s)]
*  how do you know what units to pick? You don't. You're just guessing. Yeah. So are you going [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=337.12s)]
*  online and doing any research? Yeah. So lots of research. Yeah. Hunting fool is super handy and [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=342.96000000000004s)]
*  stuff like that. Talk to the guys pretty frequently before coming up to a trip and then [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=349.04s)]
*  sort of just leaning on the hunting community a little bit, you know, and you've got guys and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=354.16s)]
*  this is what happened this trip, cause I'm starting from fresh again. It's been four years. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=357.76000000000005s)]
*  The spots that I used to hunt elk in aren't like that anymore or they're limited entry now. So, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=362.08000000000004s)]
*  and I didn't draw. So I am starting from the, you know, from scratch from the draw board. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=366.72s)]
*  And then, so I sort of leaned on the hunting community a little bit and I had a few guys [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=372.16s)]
*  reach out. Well, I had actually a bunch of people reach out, which was really nice. And, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=375.92s)]
*  you know, try this spot, you know, I hunted here last year. You're welcome to join me in this camp. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  So I had a lot of that, which was really nice. But even those guys don't know, you know, like [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=384.16s)]
*  you think you've got an animal figured out, like, fuck, think again, you know, like, and that's, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=389.6s)]
*  I think that's why I love bow hunting so much. And it's so, I've constantly got a passion for it [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=394.8s)]
*  because you never actually fully work it out. Like as soon as you start thinking you've got [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=400.0s)]
*  something worked out, you're fucked. Like they'll change it up on you. And that happens to me every [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=404.96s)]
*  year and just about every species, you know, so you can go in there with as much knowledge as you [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=409.2s)]
*  like. And obviously that helps. But at the end of the day, that's why it's so good. So appealing. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=413.12s)]
*  Well, you like a crazy hard hunt, but these are nuts. The ones that you go on are really nuts. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=417.84s)]
*  Like the one that you did last four years ago that you documented where you had that close [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=423.67999999999995s)]
*  encounter with a grizzly bear and you had a bad pistol. Yeah. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=429.12s)]
*  Fucking pistol. Oh shit. Yeah. That was a terrifying encounter. The video of you with your gun pointed [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=433.12s)]
*  out where you can clearly see that the rounds not chambered because it does, it literally doesn't [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=441.12s)]
*  fit in there. Wasn't a good situation. No. Yeah. It's, it's, I've sort of fucked myself because I, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=445.76s)]
*  I want to go to a place where there's just elk running around everywhere and stuff like that. But [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=453.04s)]
*  because I've done these hard hunts now, it's like, I can't go backwards. Like, and I'm not, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=457.6s)]
*  I'm not lining myself up for a disastrous hunt, but like, I want it to be that tough, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=462.88s)]
*  you know, like I don't want to go in on the first day and kill one. The trip's done. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, what would you do if you walked in and you saw a 350 bull on the first day? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=472.64000000000004s)]
*  Still shoot it. I would. You have to. Yeah. Well, you should never, that's the old saying, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=476.64000000000004s)]
*  right? You should never pass up on a bull on the first day that you would kill it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=481.44s)]
*  I don't agree with that. I know. No, I don't. Why's that? Because what are you, what are you in it for? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=484.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, you're in it to kill a bull. Yeah. There's also luck. Yeah. But I can't spit on luck. Yeah. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=489.68s)]
*  I think like day 27 broke me on this last trip. When I say broke me, it just, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=496.56s)]
*  I just got to the point where I was completely satisfied. So I still didn't stop hunting. I was [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=504.08000000000004s)]
*  still going to hunt to the very last day of season, which was the 30th. But you accepted your fate. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=508.40000000000003s)]
*  But I accepted it. Yeah. And that's what I actually went out there for. And I started [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=511.92s)]
*  thinking about, I'm not really here to kill a bull. That's what's pushing me and getting me to that [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=515.76s)]
*  point. But I'm here for the whole package, right? And like, your time poor, right? You don't have a [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=520.24s)]
*  lot of time and there's a lot of hunters that don't have a lot of time. Whereas I come over [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=529.36s)]
*  from Australia and I'm just like, I've got 30 days. Right. So, and that's why I don't want to [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=532.8000000000001s)]
*  kill on day one or day two. I would, like you said, if something stepped up, I would, but it's [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=538.16s)]
*  not so much about the kill. It's that whole package, you know? And a big part of that package [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=542.88s)]
*  is breaking my own self down and getting past that point. You know, and I did, I put a video up and [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=549.1999999999999s)]
*  I was like, I fucking cried, you know? And it's just like, and that's hard to show the people, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=554.8s)]
*  but I do want to show the people that it's just not about the kill. And it is hard. And it's not [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=560.3199999999999s)]
*  like all there's an animal, I stalked it, I shot it, I killed it, I got the meat, you know? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=565.36s)]
*  Right. You're going on like a vision quest. Yeah. That's it. Yeah. You're trying to find out [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=569.6800000000001s)]
*  something about yourself. Yeah. I've got no interest in climbing Mount Everest. And I've said this many [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=574.16s)]
*  times before, but if there's a fucking animal at the top of it, I'll do it. I'll do it, you know? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=578.24s)]
*  And I'll push myself to that limit. Yeah. I don't get the Mount Everest thing. Yeah. I've been [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  offered to go with people multiple times. I'm like, yeah, you can have a good time up there. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=589.2s)]
*  Yeah. It doesn't look like a lot of- There's a reason why there's no houses up there. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=593.92s)]
*  Yeah. There's like one selfie at the top and then you're coming back down. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=597.52s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I understand it. People enjoy doing things that are very difficult to do, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=600.4799999999999s)]
*  and I fully support them doing it. I just don't have any interest in it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=605.8399999999999s)]
*  just not my thing. Yeah. It doesn't float your boat. No, not at all. And if I had 28 days to do what [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=611.04s)]
*  you do, I don't know if I'd do that. But I guess what you're doing is, I mean, you hunt so much in [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=617.92s)]
*  Australia, and Australia is so game rich because there's so many invasive species in Australia. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=624.64s)]
*  There's deer everywhere. There's stags everywhere. You have so many pigs. It's a great place to get [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=630.0s)]
*  your meat. Oh, a hundred percent. Yeah. It's a fantastic place to go. I think there's 27 [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=636.3199999999999s)]
*  huntable species in Australia, and there's like one or two of them that actually need a tag, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=641.2s)]
*  and that's it. And open season on everything. We don't have to wait for September to roll around [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=648.72s)]
*  to go and get some meat or have a hunt or something like that. Which is nice. It is. It's [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=655.5200000000001s)]
*  frigging awesome. Yeah. But we don't have the system that you have in America either, which is, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=659.2s)]
*  and it's crazy that Australia doesn't have it because these animals are a resource. Yeah. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=664.6400000000001s)]
*  And they're not treated as a resource at the moment. We've just fully labelled them as [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=670.5600000000001s)]
*  feral animals, and then it sort of just gives everyone the right just to kill them in any way [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=676.08s)]
*  possible. And so they're chopper shooting them, well they have been for the last few years. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=680.64s)]
*  They just go around aerial culling them, and they just shoot them and leave them there, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=686.08s)]
*  and the meat just rots on the ground. Do they do that just to reduce population, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=689.2800000000001s)]
*  to reduce the possibility of diseases? Well, there's no diseases in any of our [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=692.64s)]
*  red meat animals that can be passed on to humans. So it's not so much for disease. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=698.48s)]
*  There is a threat of foot rot, which they have in some parts of Asia. But basically Australia's [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=703.4399999999999s)]
*  just saying, let's eradicate them. They want zero of these animals. Oh God. Yeah. Yeah. And then so [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=710.64s)]
*  they shoot thousands and thousands of deer. Thousands of them. And just like, this is just [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=715.68s)]
*  in a month, they'll shoot thousands of them and just leave them rot on the ground. It's insane. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=722.16s)]
*  Do they do it because they think they're a nuisance? They do, yeah. Yeah. But they're [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=725.12s)]
*  delicious. They are delicious. And they're no more of a nuisance than cattle or sheep. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=729.52s)]
*  Right. You know, if they're talking about erosion and stuff like that, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=735.2s)]
*  well like, or introduce species, cattle and sheep are introduced species. Yeah. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=738.0s)]
*  Shit, we've introduced species to some places, you know. Are they talking about it because of [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=742.4s)]
*  erosion? Like, what are they saying the nuisance is? A big part of it's erosion. Yeah. Then damage to [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=746.72s)]
*  like trees and fences and stuff like that. And that's true to a certain degree. But yeah. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=752.08s)]
*  But the benefit of the resource. Oh, a hundred percent. Yeah. Especially if you want really [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=760.1600000000001s)]
*  healthy meat. It's just, it's everywhere. Especially if there's people starving. Yeah. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=764.64s)]
*  This just shot and left. It doesn't make sense. That's so crazy. It feels like we're living in [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=769.0400000000001s)]
*  the bloody stone age when they do that. Yeah. It's just cutting off your nose to spite your face. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=773.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. It's so stupid. It just, I don't understand why people would accept that. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=777.36s)]
*  Yeah. And as a hunter, you like, I get to see these animals up close, you know, and you realize [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=781.36s)]
*  that they are beautiful animal and have a lot of respect for them. And then so you see, when you [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=785.92s)]
*  see that happening, it is pretty upsetting. Yeah. That's a bummer. So have you been there [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=790.24s)]
*  when they've helicopter shot them? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, so you're out hunting and you just see the gunshots [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=794.08s)]
*  going off. Yeah. Oh, there's a guy, a couple of guys in Australia that just filmed it. They're [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=799.6s)]
*  hunting on private property and the helicopter comes over and just like shooting right behind them. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=804.64s)]
*  Yeah. And they don't care that you're there? Nope. They don't care or they don't know. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=809.52s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. That's a bummer. Yeah, it is a bummer. Yeah. It's pretty sad. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=813.6800000000001s)]
*  Why? Why did they have that attitude about it? Why don't- [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=819.2s)]
*  Because they're just labeled and pushed as a feral nuisance animal and that's it. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=821.9200000000001s)]
*  You know, and there's like, it's, we don't have the same system as you do here where it's like [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=827.76s)]
*  all the hunters that I meet here full cherish the animal and the meat, you know, and they collect [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=832.64s)]
*  it all, you know, and it's not about like, oh, you know, just I'll leave that part. It's like, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=836.8000000000001s)]
*  how much more meat can we get off it? Can we trim a little bit more off the bone, you know? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=840.72s)]
*  Right. And even I'm like that, I can't take the meat home. I always donate at whatever animal [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=844.5600000000001s)]
*  that I harvest here, but it is, it's like, how much more can I get off it? What else can I take? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=848.64s)]
*  You know, and it's, and it's because so much passion and everything goes into it. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=853.28s)]
*  Why don't they let you bring meat back to Australia? Customs is really strict in Australia [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=857.36s)]
*  and because there's no diseases in our red meat, I think they're really, really strict [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=862.24s)]
*  that they don't want that. Well, how are you going to get disease from a dead animal with frozen meat? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=866.64s)]
*  I don't know. More stupidity. Yeah, I don't know. That's so stupid. I've heard that they do that [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=871.36s)]
*  with Africa. If you bring an African animal back to the United States, you can't bring the meat back. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=874.72s)]
*  Okay. Is that true? Well, because I've never brought meat back into America. Yeah. And I [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=878.96s)]
*  tried to take it into Australia, but I know that it's a no go. So like I said, I've just always [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=885.6s)]
*  donated it. But I think you can bring back meat from Australia. You guys probably can because [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=890.0s)]
*  yeah, it's so clean. I know you can from New Zealand. Yeah. So we can bring a certain amount [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=895.76s)]
*  into Australia from New Zealand, but it has to be commercially processed and packaged. So, which [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=900.4s)]
*  isn't a bad thing still, but look, there's that many people with their hand up to take meat. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=906.48s)]
*  Right. It's like nothing goes to waste when we harvest it. It's amazing. Yeah. Once, and once [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=910.88s)]
*  you get a taste for it, and like, I don't even taste the gaminess to any meat anymore because [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=916.8s)]
*  that's pretty much all we eat at home. But once you've eaten game meat and then you go and buy a [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=921.12s)]
*  store meat and eat it, it's the blandest shit going. I don't understand that term, gamey. I mean, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=925.5999999999999s)]
*  I think when people say gamey meat and they're thinking about that, they're thinking about [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=932.64s)]
*  someone who has handled meat incorrectly. That's spot on. Yeah. They let it sit out in the sun. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=937.12s)]
*  They didn't cool the meat off quickly enough. They didn't hang it. They did something wrong. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=942.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. It's not prepared correctly. Yeah. There has to be something wrong. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=947.36s)]
*  Unless you're eating something like a bear that's been eating a rotten animal or I've heard people [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=951.2s)]
*  catch, they've eaten bear that have been eating nothing but fish and they're nasty. Yeah. Okay. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=957.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah. It does make sense. Yeah. Cause everyone's always said like, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=963.6800000000001s)]
*  like the tar in New Zealand, oh, it's a smelly goat, you know, or the pronghorn here in America. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=968.72s)]
*  Right. Cause they do have that smell to them. But once it's prepared, prepared correctly, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=973.68s)]
*  oh, it's delicious. I think the thing about the pronghorn too is that you hunt them in the summer [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=979.1999999999999s)]
*  and it's very hot. And a lot of times people are dragging the carcass across the sage, you know, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=983.28s)]
*  and they just don't take care of it properly. No. Whereas it's just being quick with it, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=988.8s)]
*  you know, like field dress it straight away. Like even before photos, you can knock the stomach out [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=992.0s)]
*  and stuff like that and then set it up right. Get it as cool as possible. Cause you've only got to [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=996.16s)]
*  cool the temperature of the animal from what it was when it, when you harvested it. And then I [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1001.68s)]
*  believe it can up or down about 10 degrees and it's still fine. You know, so it's just keeping it [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1006.16s)]
*  under that range. Yeah. And somehow or another just getting it to ice quickly. Yeah. Yeah. Having ice [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1012.48s)]
*  ready, having a cooler ready. Yeah. You know, what do you do in terms of, do you bring a cooler with [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1018.0799999999999s)]
*  you when you do these 28 day trips? Cause I know you, you actually cut a fucking toothbrush in half [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1025.12s)]
*  to save weight. So I know you do a lot of radical shit to save weight. Well, you have to, right? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1030.56s)]
*  Every bit counts, including the bow and the accessories on it. You know, so I've, I'm shooting [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1035.12s)]
*  just carbon bows for the last 10, 15 years now, because that bow, a lot of the times ends up on [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1039.6s)]
*  your backpack. So it's like, what's the use of cutting a toothbrush down to a quarter, you know, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1045.04s)]
*  and you've got like toothpaste for the brush your teeth like three times in the month. Like you do [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1049.04s)]
*  all that shit and then you carry a big heavy bow, you know, right. Unless you need a heavy bow to [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1053.6s)]
*  shoot really well. Like obviously, you know, you don't want to step on your own feet like that. But [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1057.76s)]
*  once I kill that, that's it. You're done. You're hiking the animal out because you can't get a [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1063.76s)]
*  cooler back there. Right. You know, and if you had a cooler in your truck at the trailhead and you're [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1068.32s)]
*  back there for 30 days, there's no ice back there anyway, or someone's going to steal it. Yeah. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1072.9599999999998s)]
*  Being pretty lucky at trailheads here in America, I've never had anything like that happen. But [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1078.9599999999998s)]
*  well, most people are respectful. Yeah, they are. But it just takes that one. It takes the one dickhead. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1082.64s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And there are dickheads. There is. Yeah. So look, the second I kill, I'm out of there. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1086.88s)]
*  And if I'm way back, I usually try and I've carried them out before I've had a buddy come in and [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1092.8000000000002s)]
*  carried them out. I've had a guy with pack horses ready on on call. So you kill, he comes in, you [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1097.5200000000002s)]
*  get it out. Or this trip, I had a bunch of friends, and guys that sort of were telling me spots to [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1104.4s)]
*  hunt. And they were pretty much on call. And then, yeah, I sent them a photo, I dropped that bull, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1111.36s)]
*  had the bull down, sent them a photo. They're like, we're two and a half hours from the trailhead. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1117.12s)]
*  We're on our way now. And then, yeah, by the time I field dressed it and prepped it, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1120.8799999999999s)]
*  they rocked up with backpacks. And then, yeah, three of us carried it off. That's nice. Yeah. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1125.12s)]
*  Did you give them the meat? Yeah. Yeah. That's nice. Yeah. I donated to a couple of families [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1129.28s)]
*  that helped me. That's nice. Now, this trip. So did you stay in the same place for 28 days? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1133.6s)]
*  I ended up moving. So Kimmy, my wife, come with me for the first 15 days. And it was hell. Like, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1140.0s)]
*  day one or day two, we seen two nice bulls that were leaving the area. And then we never seen [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1146.96s)]
*  a bull in there again for 15 days. And she actually had a bit of elevation sickness. We'll [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1152.56s)]
*  climb it up one morning. And she started feeling sick. And we get all like, we're way out there. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1158.56s)]
*  And we get way back. And we're climbing up this mountain and a gunshot goes like, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1163.92s)]
*  straight off in front of us. Because Colorado's got muzzleloader at the same time. And that was [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1168.32s)]
*  about the point that she's like, look, book me a flight. I'm going to go home. It was one of the [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1174.8s)]
*  kids birthdays. So then she went home and we're already doing pretty radical stuff like back there. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1178.32s)]
*  And then I was like, right, fuck it now. When you say a gunshot went off straight in front of us, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1184.4s)]
*  like how far in front of you? 100 yards. Was it shooting in your direction? No, it was shooting [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1188.72s)]
*  to the side. But still like that shit happens, right? Oh yeah. Yeah. People just shoot into like [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1194.64s)]
*  movement. Yeah. But it was more to the point of actually wasn't about our safety at that point. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1200.48s)]
*  It was more about the hunting's not good. Let's, let's shoot, you know? And yeah. So she ended up [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1206.0s)]
*  going home and then I was like, right, I'm going to go pretty radical now and just fucking on a [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1212.64s)]
*  massive mission. The muzzleloader thing to me is so strange. At the same time, or are you talking [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1216.16s)]
*  about just shooting a muscle at all all the time? I, I get at the same time, it's weird because why [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1221.6s)]
*  would you have a rifle and both seasons, both seasons quiet. Yeah, that doesn't make sense. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1227.6799999999998s)]
*  But the muzzleloader thing in general, all it's going to do is prevent you from getting a good [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1232.32s)]
*  second shot. Cause there's muzzleloaders that you can shoot that are good to hundreds of yards. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1237.36s)]
*  So it's like, you're not limiting the effectiveness unless you are saying that you have to shoot iron [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1243.1999999999998s)]
*  sights. And then aren't you limiting the ethical shots that you can take? You probably are, but [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1249.84s)]
*  how do you, how do you argue that? And then traditional bow hunting or even bow hunting. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1255.9199999999998s)]
*  Oh yeah. You know, cause it does take time to get it. I'm not saying it should be illegal. Yeah. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1260.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I'm just saying like, what are you doing? Like I would rather use an actual rifle. Yeah. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1264.6399999999999s)]
*  And just like a really sighted in rifle with a great scope and you know, a good round, like a [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1269.28s)]
*  real rifle. Yeah. I met a guy with a crossbow this year, not while I was hunting. It was after the [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1275.6s)]
*  hunt was done. And he said he's, he had a scope on his crossbow and he said it's accurate out to [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1282.08s)]
*  140 yards. Wow. As in like shooting a golf ball at 140 yards. Well, if you got to rest, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1288.0s)]
*  that's the thing about a crossbow. You could sit it on a log. Yeah, that's nuts. Like how much [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1295.1999999999998s)]
*  further can we go with this stuff? Yeah, that's a weird thing. I heard someone describe it like [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1299.28s)]
*  trans men or trans women competing against biological women. If you call yourself an archer, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1305.04s)]
*  someone described it that way. I think that's pretty accurate. And then the traditional bow [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1311.6s)]
*  hunters are probably saying that about me and you shooting a golf ball. Yeah. Sort of, but you know, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1315.12s)]
*  the traditional thing is weird too. Like I get it. I get all of it. But I think if you're going [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1322.0s)]
*  to shoot a traditional bow, you have to be a guy who's been practicing for a long time and you have [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1328.24s)]
*  to put a lot of hours every day doing that. Cause it's essentially like, you have to judge [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1333.52s)]
*  just based on how far you know an arrow drops. It's all in your head. Like throwing a rock. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1339.12s)]
*  Throwing a rock. Yeah. Yeah. Throwing up rocks. Yeah. It's not even throwing a rock. Cause it's [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1345.6s)]
*  the same. It's like throwing a baseball. Yeah. You know, like you have to be really good at it. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1350.32s)]
*  Yeah. I did it for about three or four years, like pretty like hard up. And the best way that [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1354.24s)]
*  I can sum it up is to be regularly successful with a traditional bow. I'd have 50 shots every [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1360.48s)]
*  single day and I'd have 25 shots for form minimum. And then I'd have 25 shots as in aiming to be. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1366.64s)]
*  And, and so you had to do that every day. So once you get time poor, like it's really hard to keep [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1375.2s)]
*  that up. And then, and, and I was successful in doing it, but the beauty of a compound bow was [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1381.1200000000001s)]
*  like, even if I was flat out at work once a week, I could shoot the bow stay sighted in. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1387.12s)]
*  You pick it up and away you go again. It's still hard. Like you're still fully handicapped. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1393.44s)]
*  Yeah. So I was like, it's hard enough without being like, okay, I'll go traditional bow hunting now. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1398.08s)]
*  So I was just Northern territory, Australia, like last month. And I had a couple of days with a [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1402.24s)]
*  compound and it was like, had a brilliant hunt, like that done really well. And I was like, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1407.36s)]
*  ah, stuff it. I'll go with the trad bow for the next couple of days. And so I hunted with the [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1411.68s)]
*  trad bow and shot a bunch of pigs and a Buffalo and stuff like that. And then when I went back [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1416.08s)]
*  to the compound, I felt like I was shooting a sniper rifle because the recurve is so hard. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1420.56s)]
*  Well, I would imagine that it would help your compound bow. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1426.32s)]
*  A hundred percent. It does. Yeah. And so my effective range with a trad bow is like 30 yards. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1429.4399999999998s)]
*  Ideally I'm at 10 or 15. So even having the stalk in that close, which with traditional gear, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1435.6799999999998s)]
*  and then having the compound and being at like 40, 50 and being just like, oh, this thing's done, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1442.4s)]
*  and shooting it. So do you bring a lot of arrows with you when you go on these back country hunts? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1448.24s)]
*  On the Northern territory one, I do. Yeah. This hunt, no. Colorado one. How many you bring? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1453.2s)]
*  Five arrows in the quiver. That's it. Yeah. Yeah. I think I actually, yeah, I think I took seven or [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1457.92s)]
*  eight. So I had a couple in the backpack this trip and, um, cause I shot a grouse as well. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1464.4s)]
*  So pretty much arrows done because usually you're shooting them off a branch. Um, and then I, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1470.8799999999999s)]
*  one of the days I stacked it pretty hard, like fell over and hit the rest and bent the rest down, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1477.36s)]
*  or the rest shifted. Then I, so I had spare arrows to actually pull it back up and shoot my bow in [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1483.12s)]
*  the place. And luckily it just sort of ripped that grub screw down. So I could see the position that [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1489.12s)]
*  I had the city and I had one shot and it was bullseye straight away. So, but I still wanted [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1493.76s)]
*  a couple of shots because of it. So, but like you're going to shoot one bull, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1498.0s)]
*  it wasn't like I had a mule deer tag or another tag with me. It was just like, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1503.76s)]
*  but sometimes you have to take follow-up shots. Sometimes things hit branches, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1507.52s)]
*  about five arrows in the quiver. You should be, you should be, especially if you're limited to [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1511.36s)]
*  a distance, you know, are you still using those, uh, two blade solid broadheads? Which company do [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1517.04s)]
*  you use? Use Kyoga broadheads. Yeah. Yeah. So they've got a broadhead. How do the Australians [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1523.6s)]
*  use those? Because they like, how can you tell if you're not hitting the bone or not? Right? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1527.76s)]
*  Like I'll watch these videos of these white tail dudes shooting white tail and the arrows hanging [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1533.6s)]
*  out the white tail this much and they still kill it because they've got a broadhead that's fucking [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1538.48s)]
*  like 10 inches wide. Well, they use it in a mechanical. Mechanical, it just expands and [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1542.8s)]
*  it opens them up. But like, cause we're shooting buffalo. So I do that buffalo hunt once or twice [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1547.76s)]
*  a year. And then like some of our bigger deer, like the red deer are pretty solid as well. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1553.52s)]
*  With a two blade broadhead, you can still split bone and punch all the way through the animal, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1558.8799999999999s)]
*  you know? And it's like, if you shoot something in Australia using that sort of setup, like 70 [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1563.84s)]
*  or 80 pound bow, a good like micro diameter shaft. So there's no restriction on the shaft [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1568.0s)]
*  actually passing through the animal after the broadhead and a decent solid broadhead. If you're [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1573.2s)]
*  not picking your arrow up in the dirt somewhere out the other side, you're like, shit, where did [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1576.8799999999999s)]
*  I go wrong? You know? And it's like, so there's, there's hardly any, what we'd call like flag in [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1580.48s)]
*  an animal where the arrows hanging out of it. It's like punch straight through hole in one side [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1586.16s)]
*  and out the other. Like that's what you want. I just know so many people that have made shots [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1590.48s)]
*  with those little single bevel, small, tiny broadheads and they just, you know, the animal [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1594.72s)]
*  will run so far. Whereas if you hit it with a good two inch cut rage, that fucker's not going [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1601.52s)]
*  anywhere. If you get past the bone. Yeah, for sure. But if you've shot it in the right place, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1607.76s)]
*  like double lungs is double lungs. So if you've actually got double lungs, that animal's dead. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1613.12s)]
*  You know? And it's just like, but there's pros and cons to it for sure. Old lack of blood trail, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1618.32s)]
*  whereas you'll shoot something with your setup and, and crime scene. Yeah. There's just, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1623.52s)]
*  you're just a pain to the ground. You know? Cam Haynes is shooting a four blade. Is he? Yeah. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1628.72s)]
*  He's shooting a carnivore. It's like, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1632.72s)]
*  I can argue with what Cam's doing. Cause it's just shit just dropping everywhere around him. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1636.4s)]
*  Well, he wasn't forever. He would, he would go with a muzzy trocar. That was his thing. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1640.48s)]
*  Yeah. Three blade fixed head. That's all he ever shot. And then Wayne Endicott's like, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1644.56s)]
*  you really have to try these. And he had like a questionable hit on a deer and he's like, shit. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1649.6000000000001s)]
*  And then he saw the deer run 30 yards and die instantly. And he's like, whoa. And it's just [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1655.52s)]
*  cause you're just opening them up. Yeah. In Lenyle shooting the rage, that trip with you guys. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1659.92s)]
*  And, um, I made like a pretty average shot. Like I'd expect the animal to probably run a [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1665.2s)]
*  hundred yards before he pulled up and dropped. And it was just like, he ran 20 yards and just [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1670.64s)]
*  dropped and I was like, wow. And got over there and yeah, pretty much already field dressed him [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1675.52s)]
*  and everything, you know? Yeah. Yeah. It's a, that's the weird debate amongst bow hunters, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1680.24s)]
*  fixed blade or mechanical. When I really got fixed on a fixed blade was called this big red [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1688.16s)]
*  stag in like he'd come down through the mist. Like couldn't even see him. Just could hear him up [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1694.88s)]
*  there raking a tree like in the rut. And then started calling and hearing coming down the [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1699.44s)]
*  mountain. And he sort of come, come slightly angling on, but pretty much facing me. And I was [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1704.4s)]
*  like, like, shit, I'll wait for him to turn. And he was pretty much going to come straight over the [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1710.5600000000002s)]
*  top of me. So I thought, ah, I can slip it in there. And as I shot, he turned, so I hit him [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1714.4s)]
*  right on that bone, that front leg bone, and it split the ball joint of the leg bone like straight [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1719.68s)]
*  in half, um, angled down, went in through a rib, through his heart, out through another rib and [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1726.0s)]
*  into the bottom joint on the far side leg. And like, it just dropped you on the spot because it [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1733.3600000000001s)]
*  pinned his legs together. Obviously died pretty much instantly through the heart and carried, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1737.2s)]
*  like took all the meat out, deboned it, thought I'd keep all those bones and boiled them out. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1743.04s)]
*  And so it split four lots of bones to go through that stag. Otherwise I was just wounding it. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1748.08s)]
*  And it was from that point there that I'm like, I'll never shoot anything else. And I don't have [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1754.8799999999999s)]
*  to change like from shooting, you know, um, goats or deer, small deer to shooting a massive buffalo. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1759.76s)]
*  I don't change my setup, you know? So the arrow is always at around 550 grains. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1767.4399999999998s)]
*  The broadhead's the same. I can resharpen them. So you talk about these long trips [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1772.9599999999998s)]
*  and trying to save weight. I don't carry spare broadheads or anything because those broadheads, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1778.0s)]
*  like they'll pass through an animal. They'll hit a rock on the other side. You pick it up, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1783.28s)]
*  you file it off. Then, you know, you get it razor sharp, so it's shaving hairs again and away you go. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1787.28s)]
*  You know, that's why I like the setup. But every now and then I'll have limited blood trail. I'm [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1793.44s)]
*  like, shit, I should be shooting a big expandable broadhead, but I don't want to change. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1798.24s)]
*  I get it. Yeah. Yeah. It's that six in one half a dozen. And it's like, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1803.68s)]
*  that's like nearly American hunting culture and the two blade fixed broadheads, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1808.72s)]
*  like Australian hunting culture. That's why I asked because everybody over there uses those. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1813.2s)]
*  We're getting that way. There's a lot of people shooting those broadheads now, but [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1818.64s)]
*  you guys had release aids and sights like 10 years before Australia would go to it. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1822.16s)]
*  And if you shot sights in a release aid, you're a fucking pussy. Like in Australia. Oh, shit. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1826.64s)]
*  You're a pussy? To know where you're shooting? Exactly. And then I was hunting with an old [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1831.04s)]
*  friend of mine, John, and he had a release aid. And I'm like, what's the big deal about those [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1836.08s)]
*  release aids, dude? And he's like, oh, have a shot of my bow. And like, we're just sitting around camp. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1840.16s)]
*  You were shooting fingers. Shooting fingers, like always shooting fingers. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1845.44s)]
*  With a compound? With a compound, yeah. And open sights. Like that's all [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1848.32s)]
*  instinctive. Timber arrows, dude. It was insane. Like you had to spine test and check all your [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1852.64s)]
*  arrows and like twist broadheads to get them right and glue them on and stuff like that. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1857.92s)]
*  And he was one of the first sort of technical, what we'd call a technical bow owner in Australia [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1862.8s)]
*  that I knew. And I remember him shooting and it was just like seriously like golf ball size at [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1867.52s)]
*  20, 30 yards. Like every time I'm like, how the fuck can you do that? Cause you know, our arrows [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1873.04s)]
*  sort of had a spread of at least a tennis ball or slightly bigger, you know? And then I shot with [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1878.64s)]
*  his release aid like four or five times and I'm just like, holy shit, what am I doing? Cause it's [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1885.0400000000002s)]
*  just like pinpoint, pinpoint, pinpoint, you know? Just a minimal amount of movement on the back end. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1889.3600000000001s)]
*  A hundred percent. And the same release every single time. And it's like, okay, you can't keep [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1895.5200000000002s)]
*  that. That's what's so fascinating about archery. It's just one little tiny movement one way or the [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1899.92s)]
*  other as it translates 80 yards ahead, can be a foot and a half. A hundred percent. Yeah. Which [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1903.6s)]
*  is just so nuts. And it comes down to so much, the bow tune, your sight, your release, the arrow, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1908.1599999999999s)]
*  how straight the broadhead is. It just, there's so much to it. What release are you shooting these [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1915.4399999999998s)]
*  days? So now I'm shooting a Spot Hog. I'm not a techie guy, so I don't even know the name of it. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1919.6799999999998s)]
*  You're shooting the Cam Hanes one? Yeah, like a Cam Hanes one. The whippersnap? No, the wise guy. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1924.6399999999999s)]
*  The wise guy that's here. The purple one? Yeah. Cause I had a hunt in New Zealand and I had a [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1928.8s)]
*  release aid that I'd been shooting for 10 or 12 years jam up on me on a big red stag. I called [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1934.72s)]
*  this big red stag in and like pulled the trigger and it didn't go off. And then, and then because [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1940.72s)]
*  I pulled the trigger and it didn't go off, I looked down like, what the hell's going on? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1947.36s)]
*  And then it went off and it shot between this red stag's antlers. Like I'm lucky I didn't hit him [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1951.2s)]
*  and wound him. And that like, I only need to fail me once. And I'm like, okay, I'm not doing [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1955.44s)]
*  that again. Did you get grit in it or something? They actually changed the metal material that [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1960.48s)]
*  they were using. Is this a Carter we're using? Yeah. They changed it. And I've had two since, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1967.68s)]
*  and they've both done the same thing. They get jammed up. And like, like you'd see the amount [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1974.24s)]
*  of hunting I've done, I'm going through water, I'm going through dirt and grit, I'm going through [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1978.64s)]
*  crap. And it's just like, like properly locked up where it's holding on to 80 pounds without [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1982.24s)]
*  letting go. And then so I mucked around up at my farm, like I can shoot out to what, however [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1987.6s)]
*  distance you like. I'm up at the farm and then I was trying, like trying to get it to go off and [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1994.08s)]
*  I still couldn't get it to go off. And then so that's why I changed because that wise guy's got [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=1998.32s)]
*  very limited moving parts in it. Yeah. It's the most simple really. It is. Yeah. So I bought three [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2003.68s)]
*  because I, I now I keep one in the backpack. So I've just like cryovac it so no crap can get in [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2010.64s)]
*  the backpack. And it's just in the backpack sitting there waiting as a spare. Also, if you just [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2015.92s)]
*  breathe on that thing goes off. Oh yeah. It's sweet as it's so hot. Yeah. I love it. And it's [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2020.72s)]
*  either loaded or it's not. Yeah. So yeah, I really liked that. It's very simple. I like the belt [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2025.68s)]
*  buckle though. Better than the boa. Yeah. So I've got the boa one and I don't like that. You don't [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2030.8000000000002s)]
*  know that it's in the same position each time. Right. Whereas the belt buckle, I've got a mark [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2036.8s)]
*  on mine. You know, we talk about the littlest things help. So I've actually got a mark on mine. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2041.2s)]
*  So I know what one to do it up to each time. And yeah, it's, it's sweet. The only thing that [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2045.6s)]
*  people don't like about the wise guy is that it's so hot that you can't get a surprise release. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2049.92s)]
*  Cause you're essentially, if you touch it, it's going off. Yeah. Yeah. But I've always shot like [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2055.84s)]
*  that and I don't want to change. Like I, I, let's just say a deer bust out of the brush and runs [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2060.8s)]
*  past me. I want to be able to punch it. What you call punch it. It's like I'm on bang, you know, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2066.16s)]
*  whether you're leading it by a foot or whether it's going slower and it's a couple of inches, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2072.3999999999996s)]
*  you're leading it by whatever. I've always liked shooting that. I've been thinking a lot about that, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2076.24s)]
*  you know, because I've talked to Joel Turner and he brings you through, you know, that whole shot [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2082.16s)]
*  IQ process. I think you can shoot a release and make it go off, but you make it go off while you're [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2086.72s)]
*  in control of all your faculties and you're not panicking and you have a shot process. Yep. I mean, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2096.0s)]
*  if I have a hinge and I pull it back for people that don't know what a hinge is, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2104.24s)]
*  a hinge is a release that you don't have a trigger. You're just rotating the release and [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2108.4s)]
*  eventually it goes off. Well, sort of, cause it gets to a click and the click is saying, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2113.28s)]
*  Hey, we're real close. It goes click. It gives you an audible click. And what that is, is to let you [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2118.8s)]
*  know that this release is about to go off and all you do is pull and it goes off. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2123.68s)]
*  How is that any different than keeping your shit together and putting a finger on it? Yeah. What I [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2129.12s)]
*  think it is, is a lot of these people, first of all, in the target archery world, that's a different [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2134.0s)]
*  world. Like you're standing still. There's all these people watching you. You have a target. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2141.04s)]
*  It's a bullseye. It's a circle and another circle is an X in the center. And all you're trying to do [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2147.84s)]
*  is make this absolutely perfect shot into the X and you have all this time to set up and relax. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2154.0s)]
*  And that's not the same thing as bow hunting. Yeah. Bow hunting is a very different thing. And [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2160.8s)]
*  I think the anticipation of the moment and the extreme anxiety that comes with the animal being, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2166.6400000000003s)]
*  it's really about managing that anxiety. It's not about whether or not you can make a trigger go off [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2172.32s)]
*  because you can make a trigger go off and still have perfect form and shoot a perfect shot. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2177.44s)]
*  Remy does it. Cam does it. You do it. I just think it's experience. I think because there's [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2182.32s)]
*  some people that are really good on paper, but they're not good hunting. Right. And a big part [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2188.16s)]
*  of that is that I try not to think about it because I don't have a shot process. But you also shoot [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2192.08s)]
*  animals more than almost anybody alive. Yeah. So I think I don't need a shot process and I don't [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2198.7200000000003s)]
*  like to think about it because that's when I think I'll fuck up. Right now I'm just doing, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2203.44s)]
*  I'm doing. That's it. Right. You're doing it. It works. It's as simple as that. Yeah. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2207.68s)]
*  And that's why I don't want to change either. Right. Because I do see heaps of people going [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2211.52s)]
*  the back tension and stuff like that. And I tried one years ago and I missed an animal straight [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2216.2400000000002s)]
*  away. So I'm just like, yeah, fuck that. It's done. Yeah. So it's one of those things where they say [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2220.0s)]
*  you have to get worse before you get better. Yeah. So you do that. I don't want to get worse. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2224.08s)]
*  I practice with a hinge. I've hunted with a hinge, but this year I hunted with a thumb button and [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2229.04s)]
*  I just had it set pretty hot and I executed a perfect shot. Yeah. But I went through a thought, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2236.0s)]
*  I have a process in my head and you know, I'd also had the luxury of having one elk hunt. That was [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2241.36s)]
*  just a couple of weeks before that, where I shot a nice elk and also I shot a pig a few weeks before [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2248.56s)]
*  that. So no monkey on your back. Right. You have experience. And I think a lot of people [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2253.84s)]
*  drawing on an elk in September is the first animal that you've shot in at least a year. I [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2259.04s)]
*  seriously don't know how they do it. I think that's where target panic comes from. It comes from the [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2263.92s)]
*  uniqueness and the novelty of the experience. You're overwhelmed with this is the moment you've [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2268.1600000000003s)]
*  been preparing for. Instead of like, oh, I've been here before. You know, if you ever see Remy shoot [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2272.88s)]
*  an animal, it's like, he's been there so many times. He's just rock solid. He puts the pin on [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2278.72s)]
*  it and you know, hits the trigger and it's a perfect shot. And he knows what he's doing. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2284.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. He also shoots a two blade. A guy said to me, he's like, oh, only 1% of over the counter [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2289.04s)]
*  hunters are successful. And I'm like, yeah, but they probably get to hunt three days in the season. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2295.9199999999996s)]
*  Right. How often do they even practice? Yeah. I'm like, I just did 10 years of hunting [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2301.2799999999997s)]
*  in a month. And it's just like, and I came from a hunting rich environment. Like I just come back [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2305.84s)]
*  from the Northern Territory of Australia and like, I had like loaded up big time. And I'm just like, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2312.4s)]
*  so all that pressure's off. But then when an elk bugled, I went to shit still. Cause I'm just like, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2318.24s)]
*  there's so much, not pressure, but it's just like, I wasn't seeing anything. So I was like, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2324.08s)]
*  this is your one opportunity. You're about to fuck it. And it's just like, so there's all that [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2329.92s)]
*  pressure. So I don't know how American hunters do it. Unless they're coming off the back end of [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2334.32s)]
*  other hunts. Well, that's the 1%. Yeah. That's the 1%. I've thought about this a lot because I'm [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2338.4s)]
*  very attracted to things that are very difficult to do. And I've always tried to figure out why [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2343.84s)]
*  they difficult, like why are certain things difficult? And a lot of it boils down to psychology. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2348.2400000000002s)]
*  A lot of it boils down to the way your mind processes that moment. And there's something [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2353.92s)]
*  about bow hunting that is so unique in that every situation is different. You can have similar [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2359.36s)]
*  situations. Oh, this is in a meadow. It's 60 yards. I've been here before. I know what to do. It's [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2366.7200000000003s)]
*  minimal amount of wind. I don't have to worry about wind drift. I can handle this. But then there's, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2372.5600000000004s)]
*  you know, like Cam shot this elk at two yards this year and he was crouched down on a trail. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2377.92s)]
*  He came to full draw. He expected the animal to go like past him. We're getting broadside shot is [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2386.08s)]
*  like right in front of them. Yeah. So now he has to figure out what pin to use because you know, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2392.24s)]
*  the arrow comes out two yards with a 50 meter pin. You have to that's what you have to use. Yeah, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2397.2799999999997s)]
*  you have to use a 50 meter pin. Yeah, that's literally what you have to use because the [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2402.24s)]
*  arrow is not coming. It doesn't. It doesn't hit its apex for quite a while. So when it comes off [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2405.92s)]
*  the bow, it's coming off low. So if you shoot a 20 yard pin on an animal that's two yards away, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2410.4s)]
*  you're gonna hit it crazy low. Yeah. Yeah. Nuts, isn't it? Yeah. It's like, I love the idea that [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2417.84s)]
*  there's no two the same. Yeah. Like there's really, there's no two animals the same. There's no two [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2422.88s)]
*  situations the same. They might be similar. Like you just said, like same yardage and that [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2427.12s)]
*  there's no two that react the same. And it's just, I think that's a big part of the appeal in hunting. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2431.84s)]
*  Yeah. You know, is a part of that, you know. Yeah, you're essentially every time you're doing it, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2436.96s)]
*  you're getting an education. Yeah. And that's why a guy like Kim or a guy like yourself or Remy is [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2442.2400000000002s)]
*  so successful because you have so much education. Whereas for a new person, the learning curve is so [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2447.52s)]
*  big. So when they say that 1% are successful, I'm surprised there's even one. Yeah. Out of 100 guys, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2453.6s)]
*  how many of them prepare properly? Yeah. How many of them are out there really? I definitely know [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2459.52s)]
*  there's more hardcore guys out there now. Than ever before? Ever before. Because like some of [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2464.4s)]
*  those places are 14, 20 miles into the back country. And you see, I used to see them to just get to five [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2470.2400000000002s)]
*  or six miles in the back country and I wouldn't see anyone. Right. Right. Unless they were on [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2476.08s)]
*  horses or something like that, you wouldn't see anyone. This trip, I was further into the back [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2480.1600000000003s)]
*  country than ever before. And I've seen 10 times as many hunters as ever before. Wow. So maybe we [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2484.8s)]
*  should stop talking about the back country hunting. It's too late. You've romanticized it. And fit dudes. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2490.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like carrying in proper camps, dude. Yeah. There was one morning I got up, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2496.0s)]
*  just had this massive snow storm like two days before. I'm like, this is going to kick the elk [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2501.44s)]
*  off. This is going to be sick. And I'm way back there. There's no human footprints or anything [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2505.52s)]
*  like that. No frigging elk footprints either at that point. And by the time you get back to camp, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2510.4s)]
*  cooked dinner, you're in bed pretty early, like two hours after dark sort of thing. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2516.32s)]
*  And I'll say the word again, you're rooted. So you put your head down, you're fucking fast asleep, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2521.28s)]
*  two seconds flat. And I get up in the morning and it's like dark still. And I climb out of my tent [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2527.2000000000003s)]
*  and there's this light colored blob just across from me. And I'm like, what is that? [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2533.2000000000003s)]
*  And then I start walking closer to it and it's a dude set up a tent right near me. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2540.1600000000003s)]
*  50, 100 yards from me. So he hiked in in the pitch black of night, dude, and set up his tent there. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2546.7200000000003s)]
*  And then so I went back in the tent and I'm like, shit, I've got company. It's competition back then. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2553.84s)]
*  There's no elk around. So last thing I need is another hunter pushing in on me. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2560.32s)]
*  Did he know you were there? I don't know. If he walked in in the dark, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2564.48s)]
*  I wouldn't think so. But the other thing was it was blowing a gale. And it's one of the only flats [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2568.32s)]
*  and it's sort of like on a little saddle on the mountain. So it's limited amount of places. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2573.92s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And probably slightly out of the wind there compared to where he'd walk from. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2578.48s)]
*  Was he cool? Well, I don't know. I didn't hang around to talk to him. You're in the zone. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2582.4s)]
*  Right. And that zone's wild. So the last thing that you want to see is someone from civilization. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2588.32s)]
*  Right. But occasionally, you might run into someone like yourself. Like, hey, what's up? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2593.52s)]
*  They fucking notice me and then they tell their friends and they think I'm in a bomb spot. So [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2597.76s)]
*  then all their mates come in as well. So he's trying to keep a low profile back there. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2601.6s)]
*  So then I just made me coffee really quickly and I was like, I'll go and sit on that. There's like [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2609.52s)]
*  a rock that I wanted to sit on. It's a perfect glassing point. That's why I camped in that spot. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2613.92s)]
*  And then so I made my coffee and looked up and he's walking up to the rock and this dude goes [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2618.64s)]
*  and sits on the rock that I wanted the glass from. So then I just high tailed it like in a completely [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2623.12s)]
*  different direction. And it's like, hey, well, both they're not looking at elk. There was stuff [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2627.44s)]
*  all back there. But those sort of guys, they're out there now. Yeah. And it's just- [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2632.0s)]
*  When did that change? When me, you and Cam and the other [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2639.04s)]
*  guys started talking about fucking back country hunting. Was that what it is? [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2644.2400000000002s)]
*  Was it podcast? I don't know. Probably. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2648.08s)]
*  Was it COVID, dude? COVID changed it a lot. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2650.7200000000003s)]
*  And everyone started realizing like, fuck, I better start looking at defending for myself. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2651.84s)]
*  Yes. I think defending for yourself and being able to gather food, that's a big deal. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2656.88s)]
*  Yeah. I know during COVID, I just got swamped with messages. Like, how do I start in bow hunting? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2662.8s)]
*  Like, how do I get a start in it? Like, I want to go- and because like that, like it's one of the [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2669.44s)]
*  most amazing things there is that I think people are missing out on is going and harvesting your [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2674.7200000000003s)]
*  own meat. Yeah. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2679.36s)]
*  You know, and I say it all the time. It's like, I hate being labeled as a hunter. Like, I'm just, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2680.4s)]
*  we're just human. And like, I really do think hunting is a big part of being a human. I don't [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2684.3199999999997s)]
*  think everyone can do it, you know? And I don't want everyone to do it because look what I'm [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2689.12s)]
*  having a bitch about right now. Like, you get to a trailhead, there's 30 other cars at the trailhead [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2693.6s)]
*  and it's like rough, hard country and there's 30 other cars there. Most of those cars have [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2698.3999999999996s)]
*  multiple people in them. So there's that many people, you know, sort of walking around in the [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2703.3599999999997s)]
*  wilderness. You just gotta go deeper. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2708.3199999999997s)]
*  You do. I- [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2709.9199999999996s)]
*  Or find spots that they don't know about. But that's the thing about you coming over from [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2711.92s)]
*  Australia. That's not really an option. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2715.2000000000003s)]
*  It's not. Yeah. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2716.64s)]
*  Like there's a lot of guys that spend so much time scouting and so much time e-scouting. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2717.52s)]
*  Like they're looking on, you know, on a hunt. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2723.6800000000003s)]
*  I'd be better next year, if that makes sense. Because I've already done so much land and [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2726.2400000000002s)]
*  walk in this year that it's sort of, oh, there's no sign there. There's no sign there. There's no [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2731.2000000000003s)]
*  sign. Even older sign, you know, like I've constantly taken note of like the trees that [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2734.88s)]
*  have been nibbled at by the elk in the winter. So they winter there or where there's a shed antler, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2739.68s)]
*  you know, you've sort of taken all that sort of thing in and oh, there was heaps of hunters there. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2744.3199999999997s)]
*  So stay away from that. Oh, there was bugger all hunters there. So as long as I get the [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2748.16s)]
*  followed up next year, I think I'm better off. Right. So next year you'll try to do the same [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2752.7999999999997s)]
*  sort of situation. Yeah. But it's that whole, I'm trying to make it harder. I don't want to [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2757.6s)]
*  go backwards. So like- So you'd rather have less information and make it harder? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2762.0s)]
*  Sort of. Because you want to learn on the spot? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2767.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. You just like punishment. You're a glutton for punishment. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2769.6s)]
*  The big thing I want to do next year is walk from the very start of the season to the end of the [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2773.2s)]
*  season. So just walk one way. And it's hard to find a mountain range that you can do that. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2778.96s)]
*  Because if there's no elk, you keep traveling, you know, and you run out of country basically. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2783.44s)]
*  So like this year I did just short of 500 miles. But if there was game, I might have only did 100 [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2789.8399999999997s)]
*  miles. Or 10. Or 10. Yeah. But because there was no game, like literally like no prints on the [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2797.52s)]
*  ground that it's like, there's no use staying here, pack up, can't move. Right. And then I end up [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2803.68s)]
*  walking so far that I walked out to a highway at the end of the unit and called a friend and it's [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2808.32s)]
*  like, Hey, is there anyone that can pick me up? Because my truck is like seven days walkaways. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2814.16s)]
*  And then, and then so yeah, he's, he's dad knocked off work and like absolute legends. That's pretty [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2821.2s)]
*  cool. His dad knocked off work, drove like three hours to where I walked out, pick me up and then [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2828.3999999999996s)]
*  drop me back to my vehicle. Well, that's a nice guy. You owe that dude. Yeah, I do owe that dude. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2832.8799999999997s)]
*  Send him a boomerang or some shit. I'll take your Buffalo hunting. Yeah, there you go. Yeah, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2837.7599999999998s)]
*  I'll do. Yeah. Well, don't do that. You might get them eaten by crocodiles. Fucking psycho. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2842.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh shit. They're bad too at the moment. Are they bad in Australia? Yeah, they just seem to be [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2847.36s)]
*  more regularly everywhere. Yeah. Are you allowed to hunt them there or are they protected? [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2853.6s)]
*  I think you can get a permit. Isn't that funny? You just shoot deer out of a helicopter, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2857.6800000000003s)]
*  but these fucking monsters tell me about it. Tell me about it. What the fuck? Yeah. Yeah. So about, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2863.04s)]
*  it was about 12 years ago now, we went into the community. So like an Aboriginal community [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2868.8s)]
*  and they had had kids taken, right? And that's their only water source. And they had had kids [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2874.48s)]
*  taken out of that water source. Pretty sad. That just drives me crazy. Yeah. That's right. I just [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2879.68s)]
*  don't understand that. Kill those fucking things. So I'm not saying kill all of them. Yeah. They [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2885.36s)]
*  kill everyone that's around people. Management, right? Jim Schocke was on the podcast a while [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2889.36s)]
*  back and he was telling a story about how they had actually hired him to go to Africa to hunt [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2893.84s)]
*  crocodiles because there were so many crocodiles that were taking people in this village and they [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2898.88s)]
*  would set up stakes in the water so that the crocodiles couldn't go through the stakes to [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2902.88s)]
*  get to them. But they figured a way around the stakes. And this woman while he was there was [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2908.88s)]
*  washing clothes and she got jacked. Wow. Yeah. He said everyone there was like missing a hand, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2913.2000000000003s)]
*  bite taken out of your leg. He said it was just an epidemic. And that's like their everyday life. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2918.4s)]
*  It's nuts, isn't it? These are big, big 18 foot, 19 foot crocs. Yeah. Yeah. Just giant African [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2922.88s)]
*  crocodiles, which are just the most terrifying animal in the world to me. Yeah. Because they [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2931.68s)]
*  could lay there underwater and you don't even know they're there. They jump up and get you. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2936.16s)]
*  Yeah. And they're so fast. Did you ever see the video that I done in Northern Territory? [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2940.16s)]
*  And is it online? It's online. How would Jamie find it? Oh, I think I pinned it to my Instagram. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2945.44s)]
*  I sort of talk people through it, like after obviously I'm not talking when I'm walking up [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2955.6s)]
*  there. So I'm going up there and there's like all these like little water holes as it's drying up [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2960.0s)]
*  and there's all these pigs laying on like two or three water holes that way and no pigs laying on [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2964.72s)]
*  a water hole this way. So I'm like, Oh, that's a bit sus already. And then I just seen it too. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2969.52s)]
*  I can just see its eyes above the water and the back of its tail. Oh, this is it. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2974.96s)]
*  So there's a small water hole. Yeah. Jabs out. There on the bank, you can see a big saltwater [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2979.84s)]
*  crocodile. You can see his snout and his eyes closest to the bank. And then you can see like [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2984.96s)]
*  the ridge of the front of his tail. Oh God. I actually watched him come from the center of [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2989.28s)]
*  that billabong there, right to the edge when he noticed the line that I was taking to the edge. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=2995.44s)]
*  Watch this thing sink away. Yeah. You can see he's properly hunting me here. You'll see his eyes and [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3000.32s)]
*  his eyes disappear under that dirty water. Look how slow he drops away. And he's doing that to [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3007.2s)]
*  try to get you and you're walking close to this motherfucker. Look at his tail prime. See the water? [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3015.04s)]
*  So he's ready to go. How far away are you from here? Oh, 10 meters maybe. Why? Oh my God. Look [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3022.16s)]
*  at it. It's getting ready. Look at its tail. He just, yeah. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3029.44s)]
*  I just threw that stick at him. I know you're there and a little bit of a fuck you too. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3037.36s)]
*  Jesus Christ. Those things are terrifying. Look. And dragging you into that water and then twisting [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3045.2s)]
*  and tearing your limbs off. Oh, bro. You could take him Joe. You could take him. All that. I would [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3050.96s)]
*  take him from a distance with a 300 windmill. Oh, they're so prehistoric. I fucked those. But [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3062.96s)]
*  like, so that, that crocs probably never seen a person before and there's nothing else getting [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3068.4s)]
*  around there. That's walking upright like a human, but I was still food. I was still on the menu. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3073.36s)]
*  Everything's on the menu. Completely on the menu. Whereas if you see a lot of other animals in nature [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3077.84s)]
*  that have never seen a person, you know, the menu, no, you're so foreign that they just want to get [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3083.6s)]
*  the fuck out of there. Right. And he could have sunk down and turned around and sunk in that water. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3088.16s)]
*  I would never know that it was there, but instead he's like, fuck food, sweet. Let's have a crack. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3091.76s)]
*  Yeah. So, but that seems more common at the moment. And I don't know why if the population's [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3098.88s)]
*  getting too high, but you used to get around and see like a soldier or two every now and then. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3105.28s)]
*  It's not water crocodile every now and then. And, but nearly like hard to find, you know, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3110.0800000000004s)]
*  certain river systems not, but like tucked away water like that. Whereas now it's just like every [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3116.6400000000003s)]
*  fucking water holes got a croc in it. So we just bought a property up in the Northern territory of [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3121.36s)]
*  Australia and it's got a beautiful big lagoon on it. And Kimmy's like, oh fuck, that's going to be [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3127.52s)]
*  sweet for swimming. I'm like, that's the wrong state of Australia, you know, to cause the top of [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3132.8s)]
*  all the top of Western Australia and all of Northern territory and the top of Queensland. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3138.88s)]
*  That's where the crocs are. Saltwater crocodiles are in that district. And the deep inland. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3144.4s)]
*  Yeah, they can be. Yeah. So, and this property that we've purchased is, is inland as well, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3149.44s)]
*  but they get pushed in there. Like the Northern territory will have a big wet season. Water will [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3155.52s)]
*  rise like over the top of the land and everything like that water will rise. And those big salties [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3159.84s)]
*  can move into a little water hole where they've never been before. So you might have a property [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3163.92s)]
*  and been like, nah, this water is sweet. And then the next year there's a big salty in there. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3168.48s)]
*  And they can go for a year without eating. That'd be freaking desperate if they did. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3172.4s)]
*  Like you're definitely on the menu if they do that. I mean, that's just an extraordinary animal. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3177.6s)]
*  I mean, evolution just has honed those motherfuckers to a razor's edge. Oh yeah. Yeah. I [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3182.3199999999997s)]
*  think I told you about the story where like I shoot a big ball pig and like the arrow zips [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3188.08s)]
*  through it and it just dropped over onto the river bank. And I walked over there with another arrow [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3193.52s)]
*  just to see if I had to follow it up. And so I walked up and like, I'm at like a meter above it. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3198.0s)]
*  Anyway, it was just on the side of the water, like not in the water, just on the side of the water. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3203.36s)]
*  And it was just like in the final stages of its life. And I looked down and put the second arrow [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3208.2400000000002s)]
*  away like it doesn't need another arrow, it's sweet. And I looked down and put the second arrow [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3213.04s)]
*  away and just heard the water erupt. And this big saltwater crocodile come out, grabbed it. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3216.96s)]
*  I could still see it in slow mo. Grabbed this pig, like threw it over in the water and then [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3221.84s)]
*  started swimming away from it and actually took, and it was a big ball pig, actually took it under [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3227.6800000000003s)]
*  water for like 30, 40 yards and then come back up with it. And then another big salty was trying [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3232.48s)]
*  to get it off that saltwater crocodile. Now that pig was already dead. I would have just jumped [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3238.8s)]
*  straight down the back, the bank and I would have been right in the line of fire. You know, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3244.4s)]
*  I was like, that's how quick it happens, dude. You know, and it's just like, they're just sitting [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3249.04s)]
*  there waiting. I had another trip. I love these crocodile stories because they're so fucked up. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3254.16s)]
*  They make my skin crawl. Me and Kimmy did like 120 kilometres across like inland Northern Territory. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3261.68s)]
*  And it was funny because, you know, when you're in society, like back at home, you've got all the [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3269.44s)]
*  different things going on, whether it's bills, kids, you know, just a thousand things going on, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3275.7599999999998s)]
*  work and stuff like that. And Kimmy really enjoyed that trip because all you had to worry [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3280.24s)]
*  about every day was water, food, where you're going to camp. But with water comes fucking [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3286.16s)]
*  crocodiles because you have to go down and collect the water. Like we're walking 120 kilometres. You [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3292.3999999999996s)]
*  can't carry enough water for 120 kilometres. You literally fill it and it's stinking hot. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3296.7999999999997s)]
*  So you're filling your water bottle up multiple times a day. And I'm like, you stay back here [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3301.2799999999997s)]
*  and I'll race down, watch the bank where I fill the water up at. And because you're looking over [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3308.3199999999997s)]
*  this water hole, even with binoculars glassing it, you can't see a croc anywhere. Like during [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3313.04s)]
*  the daylight, like you can't see a croc anywhere. And I go down and I'm fast, like I don't muck [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3316.96s)]
*  around down there. You go down, you scoop up the water and it's dirty water, you can't drink it. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3322.4s)]
*  Then you take it back up the bank away from the crocs and you filter it up there from one water [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3327.04s)]
*  bottle to another. So anyway, I race down there, I scoop up the water, I'm halfway back up the bank, [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3331.6s)]
*  like way away from the water though. And Kim's like, look behind you. And I turn around behind [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3336.64s)]
*  me and big saltwater crocodile eyes come up straight behind me. Like that's how quick they are. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3341.76s)]
*  I went down, scooped water, got away from there, right where I filled up the water, croc eyes come [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3345.5200000000004s)]
*  straight up. Cause they had sensed movement. They're just onto it. They're probably looking [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3349.1200000000003s)]
*  at you the whole time, you know, but you just can't see it. And then, but at nighttime, like [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3353.1200000000003s)]
*  you'd shine a torch around and it's just like red eyes everywhere. So during the day, there's like, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3358.32s)]
*  you can't see a croc and then you shine a torch in a water hole at night and there's just eyes [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3364.0800000000004s)]
*  everywhere. Do you feel safe in a tent? Yeah, because they'll only come so far at the bank. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3367.92s)]
*  So this last mission that I did with a couple of friends, we had no choice but to camp within like [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3373.04s)]
*  20 yards of the bank, but it's a high bank and the saltwater crocodiles were trying to come up [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3380.2400000000002s)]
*  that high bank every night. So we ended up running fish in line, you know, like three or four inches [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3384.4s)]
*  off the ground and like tying tin cans and like whatever we could that would make noise across [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3390.96s)]
*  there just so you'd hear them coming up overnight. Yeah. So that's uncomfortable. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3396.88s)]
*  For some sickening reason, I still sleep fine, but that's really uncomfortable. But generally [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3402.96s)]
*  you're a hundred yards out of the bank. They won't, they won't come that far unless they're [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3409.44s)]
*  really desperate. So I had a buddy tell me that he'd had crocs travel to 300 yards up a bank and [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3413.76s)]
*  they took his dogs off a chain. Like they actually ripped the dogs off the chain with our locked up. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3421.04s)]
*  But he was like camp there for weeks and weeks sort of thing. So the crocs were patting and that [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3426.96s)]
*  sort of thing. And that's what they do. And that's why you don't fill up water at the same place, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3431.76s)]
*  like twice in a row. Oh yeah. Do you know anybody that's ever gotten attacked? I know people that [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3436.08s)]
*  have come bloody close. I don't know, don't know of anyone that's been attacked because they're [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3442.88s)]
*  fucking dead. But no, I, it's not fucking worse than here. Bears are walking across land. At least [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3448.7999999999997s)]
*  that danger there is at the water. It's right at the water. So if you go down. Yeah, but you need [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3458.08s)]
*  water. Yeah, but yeah. And they could be an inch offshore. They can be. And then generally I'll try [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3465.2s)]
*  and fill up water behind a tree. So there'll be a tree right on the bank and I'll stay behind the [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3472.64s)]
*  tree and try and fill up water. And then I had to dodge. Yeah. I had another one. I tagged you in [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3477.12s)]
*  it, but I know you hate that shit, but I'm like, fuck I'm tagging you anyway. And I'm walking around [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3484.3199999999997s)]
*  at night with a torch and like walking through like ankle and knee deep water trying to spot [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3488.72s)]
*  barramundi. And I was trying to debunk the myth of saltwater crocodiles and freshwater crocodiles [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3495.2s)]
*  won't live in the same body of water. You know, and that's, that's so that people are like, oh, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3504.4s)]
*  if you see freshwater crocodiles, there's no saltwater crocodiles. Well, I know that's [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3509.44s)]
*  bullshit. Is the freshwater crocodile smaller? They're smaller. They're not aggressive like that. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3512.7200000000003s)]
*  They can be territorial. They won't eat us for starters. So a freshie might bite you, [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3518.0s)]
*  but he'll let you go. Whereas a salty will bite you and hold onto you and fucking eat you, [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3523.1200000000003s)]
*  you know? And then, so I'm going around this torch and I'm seeing all these freshies [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3528.32s)]
*  freshwater crocodiles everywhere. And then I hear something moving up, like there's sort of [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3533.84s)]
*  rapids below me and I hear something moving through the water and I'm like, oh no, that's [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3539.1200000000003s)]
*  not a fucking freshie. And I turn around and start walking down there and shine the torch and it's [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3542.4s)]
*  yeah, it's a big salty and he's like coming straight up the water towards me. And yeah, [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3546.0s)]
*  so fucking they do live, they do coexist with each other. So if you see a freshie, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3550.96s)]
*  don't think you're safe and jump in for a swim. There could be a bloody salty in there too. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3555.04s)]
*  So is that just a lack of people traveling in their area? And so they've developed this? [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3558.56s)]
*  I think so. I think probably anyone that lives in the NT knows it's a myth, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3564.72s)]
*  but maybe tourists and that don't, you know? And it's like they're horrible names, right? [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3569.84s)]
*  Saltwater crocodile lives in fresh water as well. But a freshwater crocodile pretty much [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3574.7999999999997s)]
*  just lives in fresh water as far as I know. Yeah. Yeah. There's a place called Car Hills Crossing [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3580.0s)]
*  up in the Northern Territory heading out towards a part of Arnhem Land. It might be actually the [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3590.24s)]
*  border of Arnhem Land. And there's so many saltwater crocodiles on that crossing and people [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3594.96s)]
*  come unstuck there all the time because it's tidal, right? So they'll try and drive across [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3600.96s)]
*  there with a car and get their car will get washed off. And they got to swim back to the bank of all [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3604.72s)]
*  these crocodiles in the water. So it's pretty sketchy, but I still feel like Australia is safer [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3609.04s)]
*  than hunting bloody Wyoming or somewhere or Montana because of the grizzlies. And they're [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3614.72s)]
*  actually on land and can come to your tent anytime they like. Yeah. There's been a lot of discussion [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3619.36s)]
*  about removing them from the endangered list and putting tags on them, which they really should do. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3625.04s)]
*  There's a lot of places where they're overpopulated. I know they're talking about [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3631.84s)]
*  that in Wyoming and there's places in Montana where they're trying to have that discussion. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3634.88s)]
*  But again, you deal with these wildlife activist groups that don't want you doing that. And so [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3639.28s)]
*  then there's litigations and lawsuits and- It's a hard push, isn't it? Because you don't want it [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3644.48s)]
*  the other way where everything's just getting slaughtered. Of course. So there has to be a bit [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3648.56s)]
*  of a fight back, but there needs to be some sort of middle ground where it's like, oh shit, this is [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3652.48s)]
*  actually going to be better for the elk and deer population and people population. And probably [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3656.1600000000003s)]
*  better for the bears as well. The grizzlies just wipe out the black bears. The problem is that [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3662.88s)]
*  these people that are the wildlife activists, they do not like hunting in any way, shape or form, [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3669.44s)]
*  and they don't want to give up any ground. I'm going to send you this, Jamie, because this is [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3674.6400000000003s)]
*  pretty crazy. A friend of mine filmed this in California, a wolf that is near Bakersfield. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3679.12s)]
*  Oh, wow. Yeah. And he doesn't know how it got there. And he suspects that someone released it [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3688.64s)]
*  there. But this was, you know, this is right off of, you know, a mile or two off of Highway 5, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3694.0s)]
*  which is just bananas. Like that this thing was there. Not a husky, is it? [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3706.3199999999997s)]
*  No, it's a fucking wolf. I'm going to send you this, Jamie. I fucking love one. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3710.08s)]
*  Here you go, Jamie. So this, I'll just send it to you. So this friend of mine filmed this [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3714.7200000000003s)]
*  from the side of the road a couple of years ago. And they think that it's very possible that [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3722.32s)]
*  someone, you know, some rogue activist group just decided to start releasing wolves. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3728.8s)]
*  Oh, I'm sure it's happened multiple of the whole smokes. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3735.36s)]
*  Yeah. So this is in [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3738.5600000000004s)]
*  a beautiful looking animal. Amazing animal. Look at his eyes. This is in central California. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3741.52s)]
*  And you can see he's on cattle land as, you know, they're filming it and the wolf's aware [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3747.76s)]
*  they're filming it. And you see a cow. Oh, the cow's chasing. The cow's like, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3753.36s)]
*  what are you? The cow has no idea. No idea what a wolf is. Never seen one before. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3756.7200000000003s)]
*  And all of a sudden there's a wolf there. I'm sure that's happened multiple, multiple times. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3761.52s)]
*  I'm sure. There's a lot of people that think that wolves should be everywhere. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3766.08s)]
*  And they don't have cattle and they don't have dogs. They don't live there. And they just, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3769.92s)]
*  they're just, and they look beautiful. So people like you can't shoot them. You can't hunt them. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3774.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, it's just like, we've spoken about that a few times where it's like, oh, if it's a pig or [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3778.4s)]
*  something ugly, it's like, oh, yeah, hunt them as much as you like. And then it's a beautiful deer. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3782.48s)]
*  And it's like, you can't shoot that. I know. It's like, come on. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3786.7200000000003s)]
*  My own agent said that to me. She was like, you should shoot pigs because they're ugly. I'm like, [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3789.92s)]
*  that's so crazy. I got the same feelings towards a pig as a beautiful deer. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3794.0s)]
*  And they're good feelings, you know? And it's like you, as a hunter, you understand this as [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3799.12s)]
*  well, that it's not like, you know, nah, shoot it. I want to kill it. You know, it's not about that [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3803.2799999999997s)]
*  at all. No, they're all cool. They are. They are. It's cool that they exist. We're very fortunate [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3807.92s)]
*  that we get to be around them in the wild because it's such a unique moment when you're around an [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3811.92s)]
*  animal that, you know, especially the places that you go, you've probably never seen a person before. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3816.56s)]
*  No. Yeah. Yeah. I come across that a fair bit. And I just actually had an accountant with a dingo, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3820.88s)]
*  wild dog in Australia that had never seen people before. And he actually [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3827.6800000000003s)]
*  arced off at me, like was like barking flat out at me and didn't know what I was. And then, [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3831.12s)]
*  and then I was, I, I pretended to be prey. So I turned and started running the way to see what [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3837.52s)]
*  he'd do. And he come flying down the bank and like, was like, like coming at me and then he hit, [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3842.32s)]
*  hit my scent. And then it was a completely different story. As soon as he smelt human, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3848.56s)]
*  he knew it was danger and he spun around and bolted. And he actually, there was a little [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3852.0s)]
*  water hole there that he'd just walked out of, like there was wet prints coming out of the water [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3857.2s)]
*  hole in the half eaten wallaby. And they were on a kill and rampage there, these dingoes, [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3860.88s)]
*  end up finding three wallabies, one dead that hadn't even been eaten. It'd just been killed. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3867.04s)]
*  That one that I was just talking about that had half eaten, they'd half eaten another one in the [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3874.32s)]
*  creek. And that also killed a wild cattle calf. And we're eating that as well. All in this one [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3877.84s)]
*  area, they were just cutting sick. How many dingoes do they travel with like in a pack? [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3884.0s)]
*  It depends. The first dog that I seen, he was a male and he was by himself and he might be just [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3889.0400000000004s)]
*  like a traveling male. But then I've seen packs of 16 to 20 before. Wow. Yeah. They could do some [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3896.1600000000003s)]
*  damage. They could do some damage. They generally always run the other way. And that's why that was [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3902.96s)]
*  a weird encounter. Like he fully, like me and Kim were both walking down the bank in the distry [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3908.16s)]
*  river and he both were in plain view and just stood his ground on the top of the bank on the [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3912.32s)]
*  other side, just going off at us. How big are they? The size of like a cattle dog, a bit bigger than [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3917.12s)]
*  a cattle dog. So 40 pounds. Yeah, 40 pounds or so. Those dingoes right there? Yeah, they're dingoes. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3926.64s)]
*  So people keep them as pets? These will be in a zoo. Those are in a zoo? Yeah, they'll be some [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3931.2s)]
*  sort of fancy zoo. God, they look just like a dog. Yep. That's what's crazy. Beautiful animal. Oh, [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3938.16s)]
*  look at them go. They don't seem like if I saw that, I'd be like, oh, someone left their dog out [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3942.3999999999996s)]
*  here. Oh yeah. I've seen one in Arnhem Land about three years ago that looked like it was crossed [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3946.56s)]
*  with like a Tasmanian tiger. Really? Yeah. It had this cool back end, like with faint stripes on it. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3953.9199999999996s)]
*  A tail and then I was like, and then my buddy, Isaac Butterfield, you met him when I was here [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3961.2s)]
*  last month. The big tall comedian dude. Yeah. We were talking about doing like basically a search [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3966.16s)]
*  mission for them throughout Australia, doing a series on it, which I think would be really [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3974.24s)]
*  cool because they haven't been extinct for that long. And there's a lot of remote country in [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3978.96s)]
*  Australia that there's still definitely a possibility that they're out there somewhere. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3983.9199999999996s)]
*  There's a lot of sightings. Do you think that that one with the stripes, is that possible that [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3986.96s)]
*  they could be a hybrid? I really don't know. I didn't say too much about it at the time, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3991.44s)]
*  so I probably shouldn't have fucking mentioned it on JRE. Why would you want to keep that a secret? [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=3995.52s)]
*  Because I didn't know and I don't, if it is out there, I really don't want the place getting [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4001.12s)]
*  stampeded with people looking for it. Well, you know, people have been looking for them for quite [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4005.6s)]
*  a while because there are so many sightings of them, of the thyle scenes. Yeah. You know, I mean, [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4010.32s)]
*  there's a lot of people that go looking for them. There's a lot of people that absolutely believe [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4015.04s)]
*  that they still exist. Yeah. There was a Willem Dafoe movie a few years back. Yes. The Hunter. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4018.8s)]
*  Yeah. That was about a guy trying to kill the last thyle scene. Yeah. I set up a lot of trail cameras [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4024.88s)]
*  and like I haven't seen anything on trail camera like that. But then I've never seen a wild dog on [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4031.6s)]
*  trail camera and there's plenty of wild dogs in Australia. Right. And then I did another series [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4038.88s)]
*  of Isaac Butterfield looking for the Black Panther in Australia because they come over as like [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4043.6s)]
*  mascots on the US ships. And then when I think when they were told to like put them down as in like, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4047.6s)]
*  don't bring them back, they didn't want to put them down. Like these soldiers had these animals [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4054.08s)]
*  near them every day that they kicked them off on the mainland of Australia. And then so we did this [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4059.36s)]
*  Black Panther one and I set up a couple of trail cameras and obviously we never got any photos of [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4064.48s)]
*  a Black Panther. And then, you know, Isaac's like, do you think they're real then? I'm like, [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4069.12s)]
*  well, there's koalas here. There's deer species here in the mountains. There's wild dogs in the [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4074.24s)]
*  mountains. There's possums in the mountains. There's all these things that definitely exist [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4080.0s)]
*  right there and there's no photos of them. Right. So it's like everyone having scouting cameras out [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4084.16s)]
*  there really doesn't prove that there's no Tasmanian tiger. No, there's so much land. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4089.2799999999997s)]
*  There's only so many cameras. You'd have to get so fortunate. 100%. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4094.88s)]
*  But that's the argument the Bigfoot people use too though. They think Bigfoot knows what a camera [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4099.2s)]
*  is. Those people are lost. I'm sure there's been other species that we haven't discovered that are [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4105.28s)]
*  extinct or maybe not extinct. So there's still hope for something like that. Well, especially [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4112.88s)]
*  when you get to places like some of these intense, dense jungle rainforests where, you know, like [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4118.32s)]
*  how much of that's been explored. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I remember watching a documentary about a [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4126.4s)]
*  man who spent his entire career looking for the giant sloth in the Amazon because it used to exist [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4130.5599999999995s)]
*  and there's been a bunch of indigenous people that have told stories about encountering these [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4138.0s)]
*  giant sloths. So this guy was absolutely convinced that these sloths were there and he was kind of [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4142.32s)]
*  banking his career on it and it wasn't working out. And you could see the desperation in him. He was [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4147.44s)]
*  just realizing like, what have I done with my life? I might be looking for something that actually [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4152.879999999999s)]
*  doesn't exist. Doesn't exist. Yeah. You know, these people would tell him stories about it. It's like, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4157.839999999999s)]
*  this guy could be bullshitting me because I'm some fucking white dork from, you know, the Pacific [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4161.28s)]
*  Northwest or wherever the fuck he's from. Yeah. You know, looking in the Amazon for a... There's [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4166.24s)]
*  some really interesting Aboriginal paintings that there's so many of the same that you're like, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4171.36s)]
*  was that a creature that existed that we haven't found the bones for that, you know, [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4178.24s)]
*  or that's still roaming that we haven't seen, you know? Like what? I don't know. They're real weird, [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4183.84s)]
*  like tall animals and yeah, there's just, it's just like, why did they paint that over? And, [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4189.44s)]
*  you know, there's like, there's 700 dialects of the Aboriginal language. So there's a lot of different [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4196.0s)]
*  um, mobs of Aboriginal people, you know? So it's like, but why did they paint that there? And they [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4201.92s)]
*  painted the same painting there and maybe they never even got along with each other or communicated [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4207.2s)]
*  from both to the same drawing, you know? And then I watched that Graham Hancock documentary, which was [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4212.32s)]
*  friggin brilliant to watch. And I started actually thinking because they're starting to really date [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4218.8s)]
*  back some extreme Aboriginal civilizations now in Australia that I'd love, I don't know if Graham's [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4224.48s)]
*  ever been to Australia to, you know, see and witness it and study it, but love for him to [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4234.0s)]
*  come out at some point, but there's every chance that those animals existed, you know, but we just [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4238.959999999999s)]
*  haven't found them yet. And I was talking to Jamie, when I first got here about that, that [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4245.5199999999995s)]
*  bone yard in Alaska, where they're digging all that and it's just like, like what's next? And [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4250.64s)]
*  they just, they keep finding stuff that just seems to date back, date back, date back, date back. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4256.08s)]
*  He's found these ancient bones that have saw marks on them. Yeah, you haven't seen that yet? [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4260.72s)]
*  No. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4266.64s)]
*  Oh my God, very clear markings, like completely sawed through where it seems like there was a mass [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4267.12s)]
*  extinction event that happened in its document. Look at that. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4276.08s)]
*  Holy smokes. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4279.28s)]
*  Yeah, not just one. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4281.76s)]
*  Sounds like their death pit, like their waste pit. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4282.64s)]
*  No, not necessarily. No, because they've found things that are there that they didn't, [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4285.36s)]
*  like he's found multiples of these. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4290.24s)]
*  Holy smokes. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4291.44s)]
*  This is very recent. Now here's what's crazy. The saw supposedly was only invented 5,000 years ago. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4292.72s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4298.64s)]
*  And a lot of these things he's dating, they're way older than 5,000 years ago. 10, 15, 20. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4299.2s)]
*  Looks like someone was hunting and hunting six. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4303.68s)]
*  Yeah, not only that, but someone who had access to a saw and they were getting the [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4305.76s)]
*  marrow out of these mammoth bones, which is nuts, man. And there's carvings on them. They found [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4308.96s)]
*  short-faced bear skulls. They found the skulls of cats that weren't even supposed to be in Alaska. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4316.72s)]
*  He's found a bunch of species that weren't even supposed to have existed. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4323.6s)]
*  This is so cool. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4326.400000000001s)]
*  Oh man, John Reeves is the fucking man. And his place that he's got there is insane. It's [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4326.96s)]
*  absolutely insane. It's so filled with animals and a very thick carbon layer. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4333.76s)]
*  Wow. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4339.92s)]
*  Look at these bison heads there. Did you see the one that we have out front? [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4340.0s)]
*  Yeah, I did. Yeah, I'll study in it. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4343.12s)]
*  Yeah, I have to find a university that I can send that to and get it carbon dated. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4344.56s)]
*  Oh yeah, cool. Oh, so you don't know exact dates of any of these? [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4349.360000000001s)]
*  He has some. And he just sent some of those bones that have been sawed. He sent some of those to be [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4352.88s)]
*  carbon dated. So he's going to find out within the next few months. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4358.400000000001s)]
*  This is going to be really interesting. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4361.12s)]
*  Fascinating because if they're older than 5,000 years ago, okay, now we have historical evidence [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4362.56s)]
*  that predates the invention of the saw because whatever those things are cut with, that's a saw. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4368.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4373.280000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's a smooth, clean cut and it looks like human beings did it to try to get access to the [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4373.6s)]
*  marrow. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4379.4400000000005s)]
*  Marrow, yeah. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4379.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4380.56s)]
*  It sounds like the original butcher shop. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4380.88s)]
*  Yeah. Well, the area that he's at though, because of the thick carbon layer, what he thinks when [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4382.96s)]
*  he's listened to Randall Carlson and Graham Hancock discuss the Younger Dryas Impact Theory, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4391.04s)]
*  he thinks he's in an area that got hit and that these things died off instantly, that there was [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4396.96s)]
*  a large area where they existed in. And he's finding hundreds and hundreds of these animals [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4403.44s)]
*  in a small area. The area is only like six acres. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4410.4800000000005s)]
*  Wow. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4414.4s)]
*  I would have said it was smaller than that even. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4415.12s)]
*  One of them is six acres and the one that he's currently digging at is four acres. So there's [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4417.2s)]
*  multiple areas where what they do is they're blasting water into the permafrost. So they have [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4422.72s)]
*  like a cliff side and they're blasting water into this permafrost and then they'll see a [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4428.56s)]
*  woolly mammoth tusk. And if you've ever seen the documentation that he has on his Instagram, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4432.88s)]
*  he's got warehouses filled with mammoth bones and skeletons. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4438.24s)]
*  This dude must be one of the most exciting people there is. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4442.24s)]
*  He's so fucked up. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4445.52s)]
*  Can you imagine just like blasting on a wall and be like, what's that coming? [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4446.48s)]
*  Sick. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4449.44s)]
*  Yeah. Well, he's so fucking cool. But the other thing that he's documented is that the Museum [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4449.839999999999s)]
*  of Natural History in Manhattan dumped these bones in the East River. So they had these guys go out [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4455.2s)]
*  and he announced it on the podcast. He told everybody where it would be. And these guys [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4461.28s)]
*  went out there and they find mammoth bones. They found mammoth bones in the East River. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4465.04s)]
*  They found these 15,000, 20,000 year old bones that are at the bottom of the East River that [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4469.759999999999s)]
*  were dumped there by the museum. How long ago? [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4474.48s)]
*  The 20s, the 30s. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4478.0s)]
*  Far out. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4480.24s)]
*  Yeah, far out. So that's one that they just found. So they found that in the East River. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4480.959999999999s)]
*  He's going to gift it to me. Yay. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4486.24s)]
*  Oh, you've got enough gifts in here walking around. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4488.959999999999s)]
*  That's okay. It'd be dope to have that one. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4491.2s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4493.599999999999s)]
*  It'd be dope to have that one because the reason why those guys were there is because he announced [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4493.759999999999s)]
*  it on the podcast. And so they have it zip tied because it's cracked. They want to make sure it [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4497.36s)]
*  doesn't fall apart. But that thing is at the bottom of the fucking East River, which is just [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4501.6s)]
*  absolutely amazing. But John, because he's a gold miner and so his land that he has up there is [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4506.0s)]
*  originally for gold mining. But along the way, he's found a fucking fortune in mammoth bones. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4514.08s)]
*  And it's such an extraordinary area. So okay, this gets more interesting. Here's a picture of one of [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4520.400000000001s)]
*  the straight cut bones, still frozen beneath the ice wedge and the frozen muck about 50 to 60 feet [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4525.76s)]
*  below the surface. So who knows how many thousands of years of ground is covering those things. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4530.8s)]
*  And because it's permafrost, they're able to get these things out completely preserved. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4539.52s)]
*  So, so interesting. And just the fact that there's this very small area that he's finding these [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4546.0s)]
*  things in. I'm walking around all the time, like look, I've never found anything like that, but [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4552.64s)]
*  I'm just constantly looking for something like that. That's undiscovered, you know, it's like [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4557.84s)]
*  without going out of my way, like I'm just doing it while I'm hunting. But [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4561.68s)]
*  Did the aborigines, did they use bone or rock for arrowheads? Do they have that? [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4564.56s)]
*  So they didn't need bows and arrows. So that was never discovered. They didn't have a need for it [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4572.96s)]
*  because I was so efficient with spears, boomerangs. So boomerangs were basically for hunting flocks of [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4577.76s)]
*  birds. So a big flock of birds would take off. So very situated suited for Australian conditions, [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4583.76s)]
*  big flocks of birds, boomerang, spears were, you know, your wallabies, kangaroos, things like that. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4588.8s)]
*  I believe a lot of the spears were just a hardened timberhead. So like over a fire and hardened up. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4595.84s)]
*  Yeah, I'd have to look into it more. I don't want to say the wrong thing, but I'm sure there [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4604.320000000001s)]
*  was cases where they did use stones. We're going to come right back. So I got to take a leak, [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4608.16s)]
*  but we're back. And we're back. We're back. We're back. One of the things we were talking about [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4612.08s)]
*  last time you were here was that when you explained that there's 700 different languages [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4617.6s)]
*  that these aborigines have and that a mob, that's what they call like a tribe, a mob of aborigines [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4624.64s)]
*  could be just 10 kilometers away from another mob. Yeah. So one community to the next. They [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4631.2s)]
*  don't know what the other people are saying. Yeah. They wouldn't know their language, [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4637.04s)]
*  which is crazy. It is crazy. Yeah. And then like imagine that many different countries [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4640.56s)]
*  inside of America, right? Like there'd be so much conflict. So a lot of these communities had [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4645.76s)]
*  conflict with one another and then certain amounts of them were actually pushed off the land [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4651.280000000001s)]
*  as it become, you know, farmland or whatever it might've been. And have now been pushed into [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4656.96s)]
*  like communities where there's all these other separate countries, essentially dialects that [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4662.8s)]
*  have got to now coexist. And like they've been at war with one another since the dawn of their time, [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4669.92s)]
*  you know? So it's like pretty full on when you think about it like that. And then the other thing [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4675.4400000000005s)]
*  that's really hard is how do they teach that in schools where there's 700 different dialects? [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4681.36s)]
*  And they're not documented, these dialects, right? A lot of them aren't. A lot of them [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4688.16s)]
*  dying out with the people, unfortunately. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. It's a shame. This thing that you [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4693.12s)]
*  were saying about these cave paintings that show these animals, can we find those? [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4698.72s)]
*  You probably could. Yeah. I'm sure there's something documented on the net more than me [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4704.320000000001s)]
*  just saying they look similar. I'm sure there's something like that. But like whether they're a [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4709.2s)]
*  spiritual person or animal or being is hard to say. But you hear stories about the hairy people [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4715.76s)]
*  and things like that. Like that ain't people, eh? Yeah. What is that? [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4724.56s)]
*  Australian yowie. It's like a really skinny Darth Vader. We put the western word on it. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4732.0s)]
*  What is it? Yowie? Yowie. Like your big foot. Oh. So did they? Whoa. What is that image? [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4738.160000000001s)]
*  That's the yowie. So this is- That looks like the bloody devil eating someone there. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4745.76s)]
*  Something that- So these- And there's more. Wow. There's more than one of these. Yeah. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4751.12s)]
*  Huh. This thing that they- What are they showing? [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4758.08s)]
*  Yeah. Look at the similarity in them. Wow. Isn't that cool? And what are those things to the left [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4765.84s)]
*  of it? Like what is that thing? I don't know. Like what are all those things? Looks like a [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4772.56s)]
*  giant ball floating with a string attached to it. But there's so many- Scroll back down again, [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4780.16s)]
*  Jamie. There's so many similar images of these long armed creatures with four fingers. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4786.96s)]
*  Whoa. Isn't that amazing, eh? Do they know how old these paintings are? I'm sure they do know some of [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4795.679999999999s)]
*  them. But there's- So there's like- There's artifacts going back 70,000 years now. Whoa. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4801.84s)]
*  Six toes. Whatever that is. Yeah. What is that thing? So and there was like big, big like events [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4812.24s)]
*  in the last 10,000 years as in like media strikes and things like that. So it's quite interesting, [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4820.4800000000005s)]
*  isn't it? Yeah. There was a big one that's detailed off the coast of Australia around 5,000 years [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4825.84s)]
*  ago. Like look at these things. How weird. Look at their heads. Aliens, Joe. Yeah, right? Yeah. So [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4831.68s)]
*  like, yeah. I think there's even some paintings of like, like spaceships. Really? Or what you [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4840.8s)]
*  would consider as spaceships. Wow. Now, did the Aborigines, do they have a history of the use of [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4849.360000000001s)]
*  psychedelics? Are there psychedelic drugs? Take it there. Yeah. Well, I guess because there was a [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4858.32s)]
*  lot of bush medicine that they used. So, you know, whatever the side effects could have been of that. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4864.719999999999s)]
*  Look at those things. Yeah. Like bush- Look how many there is. Bush medicine. Like what does that [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4870.96s)]
*  mean? Like just natural herbs, you know, natural things that, you know, it might be the sap of a [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4876.08s)]
*  tree. It might be leaves boiled up. It might be some sort of nut. Australian rock art might be the [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4884.96s)]
*  oldest in the world. Wow. Does it actually say how old? Look how- 60,000 years. Fucking. Yeah. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4892.08s)]
*  60,000 years ago and they look like aliens. I mean, those look exactly- It's not incredible. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4900.0s)]
*  Giant black eyes, huge heads. That looks exactly like the classic gray alien. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4904.64s)]
*  Some paintings might also mean something else. So like, I know we're looking at those as faces. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4910.64s)]
*  Right. So one of my company's logos is it's a bunch of dots and the words Nalia, which is [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4917.04s)]
*  in the Nalema language, which is like the community that I'm near. In the Nalema language, [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4927.68s)]
*  it means like people come together to create a community. And then so those drawings that [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4933.68s)]
*  we just looked at could also be similar to that. Like there's two communities that are coming [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4940.24s)]
*  together. The line in the middle might mean this is their land, which could be a ridge line, you [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4945.36s)]
*  know, so your land's there, our land's here. And then the circle, the whole circle around it could [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4950.32s)]
*  actually mean the world or community, everything together. So even though it looks like a face, [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4955.36s)]
*  it could actually mean something a lot different. Right. And that's one of the difficulties in [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4961.12s)]
*  Australia with teaching the traditional people's past is there's so much to it. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4965.2s)]
*  And there's so much that's not understood from one community to the other. So it does make it [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4972.48s)]
*  very difficult, but it's sad that it is getting lost. Well, when you're dealing with 700 different [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4976.96s)]
*  languages and people that have lived in this area for 60 plus thousand years, that is crazy. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4984.0s)]
*  I mean, how much work is being done to document all this stuff? I don't really know. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4990.88s)]
*  There's a lot of these communities are very remote. So I don't know how much help there [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=4997.52s)]
*  actually is for them. I don't know how, how many people can go to a place like that to document it. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5002.16s)]
*  I don't know how many people are actually qualified to document it either. So [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5008.56s)]
*  yeah, it is very difficult. And do they have a written language when it comes to this? [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5012.88s)]
*  Yeah, all of them. I believe so. Yeah. So there's 700 written languages. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5017.12s)]
*  I don't know about written language really. Because it's one thing to speak a language, [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5022.8s)]
*  because that's what you know. But what reason do they have to write it down? [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5029.04s)]
*  Right. Do they have an alphabet like we do? Or do they share the alphabet? [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5032.64s)]
*  I don't believe so. Whoa. Yeah. I don't know enough to say too much because I don't want to [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5040.24s)]
*  offend these people, you know. Right. And I'm definitely no expert on it. I can only give you [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5045.68s)]
*  what I do know and what I've heard and learned myself. But I think a part of the struggle in [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5051.68s)]
*  Australia with Aboriginal culture is that it's not a written language. So like how can it be passed [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5058.08s)]
*  on to someone else? You're either in the family and you grew up listening to the language and [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5064.72s)]
*  understand it. Right. Or you don't. Or you don't. Yeah. And then we might lose it forever. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5068.88s)]
*  I'm sure when you're talking about 60,000 years old and over 700 different dialects. Whoa. That's [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5075.92s)]
*  a fucking dinosaur. Yeah. Wow. Whoa. It's apparently called a Yaru or it's a very close [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5081.84s)]
*  representation of a plesiosaur I think as well as this reading. Yeah. Wow. Isn't it fascinating? [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5089.6s)]
*  And how old is that? It's paintings and tradition. Whoa. They're just showing what it would have [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5096.4800000000005s)]
*  looked like. Yeah. That's fucking crazy. Getting an adrenaline rush. Wow. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5102.08s)]
*  They have drawings of fucking dinosaurs. Amazing. This is where I was getting there. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5112.32s)]
*  There's a lot of versions of that. I was trying to check. A lot of different versions of a plesiosaur. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5120.0s)]
*  Just a different one. I don't know which was the original picture from this but it's in color in [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5124.48s)]
*  some places and it's being talked about in other different parts of the internet. I'll just leave it. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5129.04s)]
*  Look at that one that says the ancient history of UFOs. The one over here. Yeah. Look at that [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5134.56s)]
*  fucking. What is that? That looks like a person or some thing in space. Oh, it doesn't have ever. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5139.12s)]
*  Yeah. Very similar to what we're looking at. Yeah. But you just got to wonder. Were these people [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5144.72s)]
*  tripping balls? Maybe. They had a dream time which sounds like it would have been like [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5149.6s)]
*  their traditional religion. Have you seen these up close? These. Not those as I've seen. But some of [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5156.4800000000005s)]
*  these? Yeah. Yeah. There's a place in Western Australia where there's over 70. This is just [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5162.16s)]
*  on a peninsula on the coast. There's over 70,000, 1000 rock art pieces just on that part of the coast. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5169.76s)]
*  70,000. Wow. And the story is that there was people that lived on the mainland on the coast. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5178.4800000000005s)]
*  This is the Pilbara region of Western Australia. And then there was people that lived on the [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5185.28s)]
*  islands. So the Dampier archipelago's 40 odd islands, I think, just off the coast. And there [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5189.2s)]
*  was another community of people that lived on the islands. I think they called them like the boat [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5195.12s)]
*  people or the canoe people or something like that because they traveled from island to island in [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5200.4s)]
*  canoes. And they looked and talked and acted so much different than the people on the mainland [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5204.16s)]
*  that when these canoe people used to come towards the mainland, the people on the mainland would [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5210.88s)]
*  clear out of there. Like would leave. That's how freaky these other people were to them. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5214.8s)]
*  It's like so fascinating to think about. What does that mean? What did these people look like? [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5221.2s)]
*  No idea. But the fact that there was 70 over 70,000 rock arts on the mainland that says that there [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5226.56s)]
*  was a lot of people on the mainland and they would clear out of there when these canoe people would [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5233.6s)]
*  come. It's insane. Wow. What were these canoe people like? I don't know. I wish there was a [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5237.36s)]
*  video. I wish there was something of it. It sucks not to go back, but it's cool that we can't go [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5244.96s)]
*  back because it's ancient. Yeah, but it is so interesting that they were so different that [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5250.719999999999s)]
*  these people would be like, what the fuck? We got to get out of here. These things are different [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5257.28s)]
*  than us. Yeah. Yeah. They must've been so foreign to us. Oh look, they have images of the things [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5260.8s)]
*  in the canoes. I'm guessing this is the same thing he's talking about. This could be 50 to 70,000 [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5268.320000000001s)]
*  years old. Wow. Kimberly rock art. 50 to 70,000. Imagine getting in a fucking canoe 50 to 70,000 [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5274.08s)]
*  years ago and making your way across the ocean and some hollowed out log. Why? Where's that from? [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5281.68s)]
*  Kimberly rock art. So what? Kimberly's Australia. So that's Northern Australia and it shows deer. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5287.6s)]
*  Yeah. That's what I'm curious about. Because yeah, deer obviously introduce species to Australia. So [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5296.240000000001s)]
*  that is- Well, what was there that was deer like? That's what's craziest if they're introduced. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5301.04s)]
*  What was deer like in Australia if it wasn't them? [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5310.56s)]
*  That is insane. That's so cool to look at. So are there any deer that are native to Australia? [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5315.68s)]
*  No deer at all. No deer at all. So what the fuck is that? If Australia didn't have introduced species, [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5321.84s)]
*  it would be the most fucking boring countryside in the universe. Is it possible that there was [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5328.88s)]
*  something like that 50, 60,000 years ago and they just wiped them out or something? 100%. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5334.88s)]
*  Asteroid wiped them out? The fact that no bones have been discovered from it, [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5340.320000000001s)]
*  you really don't know. We need a John Reeves over there with a hose. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5345.52s)]
*  Yeah, we do. But you don't have permafrost. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5348.88s)]
*  No, we don't. You have to start digging. How would you even find it? [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5350.8s)]
*  I don't know. And has it perished over that time considering the interior of Australia is all desert? [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5354.400000000001s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5360.24s)]
*  So yeah, quite interesting. No, it's an amazing place. And it is amazing [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5361.76s)]
*  that it's one of the few places that doesn't have a native deer species. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5367.2s)]
*  Yeah. It's got all weird species. Imagine never seeing a kangaroo and seeing it for the first time. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5371.12s)]
*  This thing hopping around, Joey in its pouch, standing up right. Like what the fuck? [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5377.5199999999995s)]
*  What the fuck? And even an emu, it's got all the weird species. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5382.48s)]
*  And all the weird species that have got no appeal to be hunted. And then we've introduced deer and [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5386.88s)]
*  pigs and goats and bloody camels and donkeys and everything else that's just thrived and gone. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5392.08s)]
*  Kangaroo you can eat. I've had kangaroo before. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5396.32s)]
*  You can eat kangaroo. It's very lean. It's delicious. So there's a market for kangaroo [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5398.08s)]
*  in Australia now. Yeah. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5402.4s)]
*  Yeah, which is like odd that we're eating our bloody emblem, you know? [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5403.76s)]
*  It is odd. Yeah. Like imagine eating your golden eagles. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5407.28s)]
*  Like shit. Yeah. Well, in certain places, eagles are like pigeons. Like you go to Alaska, [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5410.88s)]
*  eagles are everywhere. Yeah. And New Zealand's the same. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5415.92s)]
*  Yeah. And so New Zealand's really got no predators. I think they got like a stout, [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5419.28s)]
*  like a little ferret, you know, which picks on a lot of ground nesting birds and stuff like that. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5424.08s)]
*  That's it. But they don't have, you know, [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5428.4s)]
*  there's no bloody bears running around or, you know, anything like that. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5430.72s)]
*  Well, the Europeans brought over animals to New Zealand to turn New Zealand into a hunting [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5434.4800000000005s)]
*  paradise. Right. That was like when the, was it the 1800s? [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5438.64s)]
*  That must have been like a filthy, filthy rich dream. Like let's just turn this whole [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5442.240000000001s)]
*  island into a hunting mecca. That sounds like it would have really [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5446.320000000001s)]
*  rich person would do way back then. You know, they just had the ability to do like get a boat, [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5449.68s)]
*  feed up a stag. I've seen the images of like the tar getting taken up to, I think it might've been [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5455.4400000000005s)]
*  the top of Mount Cook in like a trolley system on wires, you know, like they, they went all out to [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5463.84s)]
*  get them to where they wanted them, you know. So crazy. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5470.0s)]
*  And it started with bugger all of them and just, they've just thrived. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5472.96s)]
*  Yeah. So New Zealand's doing the same thing [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5476.24s)]
*  as Australia where they just, you know, they're helicopter culling them and, you know, [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5478.0s)]
*  Right. But trying to eradicate them. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5482.88s)]
*  Are they trying to eradicate them? They are, yeah. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5484.32s)]
*  Yeah. Which is a shame because New Zealand's got a really good hunting culture as well. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5486.24s)]
*  Yeah. That's why it's shocking. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5490.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Like obviously if numbers get too far out of control, for sure. But trying to eradicate the [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5492.4s)]
*  whole species is just ridiculous. I was telling someone about, just, I think it might've been [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5497.04s)]
*  just yesterday about, I was actually in New Zealand. I was climbing a mountain. I don't know [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5503.12s)]
*  if I told this story here or not. And like I had to like, I had ice spikes on an ice axe to get [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5508.24s)]
*  up there and I shot a bull tar. And as I was up there, I heard something and looked up and [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5514.96s)]
*  could see all this snow and ice flicking up in the air. And then I seen a frigging tar, [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5520.88s)]
*  like full dawn cartwheels through the air falling off the mountain. And I had to grapple to the [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5525.04s)]
*  mountain to make sure it wasn't going to hit me. And this tar fell down the bottom. I ended up [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5529.52s)]
*  getting down the bottom. She was dead already. Like she'd splattered on the rocks, but I ended [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5533.92s)]
*  up putting another two out of their miseries that had broken, they had broken legs. And it's just [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5538.24s)]
*  like, you hardly ever see nature slip up like that. Right. You know, and it's just about this [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5542.56s)]
*  day, the sun come out, melted that top layer of snow, then it come over freezing cold. So it was [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5547.200000000001s)]
*  just like slick ice up on the mountain. And then so they'll fallen off and quite a few of them in [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5552.4800000000005s)]
*  the end. So yeah, pretty, New Zealand's like, you know, people always ask me like, what's the most [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5558.8s)]
*  scariest place to hunt? You know, and it's like fucking New Zealand. It doesn't even have scary [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5564.72s)]
*  animals. Did you break your leg up there and have to get helicoptered out or something? [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5568.4s)]
*  I actually fractured my spine. I haven't told that story. That's how long it's been. It's been [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5572.16s)]
*  bloody five years since I did a podcast. I think that was year four, four years ago. Yeah, I was [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5578.4s)]
*  on a hunt. I climbed in over a couple of days up the mountain, like started from the bottom, [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5586.4s)]
*  climbed up the top. I was chasing a shimmy, you know, shimmy. Yeah, I was chasing shimmy, [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5590.5599999999995s)]
*  which is like regarded as one of the hardest animals to harvest with a bow. And they're not [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5596.72s)]
*  necessarily hard animals to stalk. They're just hard to get to. But really cool hunt, good, [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5600.64s)]
*  really good eating, you know, great experience. And I think I ended up killing a shimmy on day [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5605.76s)]
*  four and the weather was rolling in right really bad. And I actually climbed into a, you know, [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5612.320000000001s)]
*  pretty horrible spot. But I was confident in doing it because I was always going to get a [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5618.8s)]
*  helicopter out, you know, like get an animal on the ground, process it, pack up camp, [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5622.88s)]
*  call in a helicopter and get the helicopter back off the mountain because going down can be pretty [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5627.84s)]
*  risky. It always feels safer going up than actually coming down with a bunch of weight on [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5632.0s)]
*  your backpack. And I looked at the weather, had a GPS on me, which could tell me the weather. And [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5636.96s)]
*  I looked at the weather and it was coming in really bad for like the next four or five days was [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5644.08s)]
*  forecast. So I called the helicopter in a little bit early, but they're like, Hey, there's a gap in [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5648.32s)]
*  the weather. We can come and pick you up right now. And I'm like, yeah, look, look, let's get it done. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5654.4s)]
*  I was pretty keen to get off the mountain. I was only like camped on this tiny little spot, [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5659.36s)]
*  like a tiny little flat spot that just sort of fit the tent. And like me coming out the front of it [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5664.16s)]
*  and the back of it was just like sheer cliff for like 200 yards straight down. Yeah, it was pretty, [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5670.0s)]
*  pretty sketchy spot, but the weather was still good. I felt comfortable there. I can hear the [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5674.8s)]
*  helicopter coming in and as the helicopter's coming in these fucking horrible clouds just start rolling [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5679.52s)]
*  in like at my height. And I hear the helicopter coming in, but it sounds like it's freaking below [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5685.360000000001s)]
*  me. And I've just got me sleeping, not me sleeping bag out, me mattress, because it's bright orange to [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5691.92s)]
*  flag them down in like the clouds. So I've walked onto the far side of the tent and I can just every [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5697.76s)]
*  now and then see these lights flashing and they're like a hundred yards below me flying in the clouds. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5704.16s)]
*  And I hear this chopper like coming in. I'm like, it's gonna, I thought it was going to smash straight [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5710.24s)]
*  into the mountain and you see them coming in, coming in. Like, I mean, it's like sheer rock [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5714.5599999999995s)]
*  straight below me and the helicopters below me. And then they seen that they were about to fly into [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5718.639999999999s)]
*  the rock wall and then they pulled back. And then I just heard them leave and I'm like, fuck, I'm here [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5723.76s)]
*  now for the next four or five days. What sucked was in the panic of them saying, [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5728.48s)]
*  yeah, we're coming to pick you up now. I packed up and got super wet, like packing up in the snow, [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5734.08s)]
*  it was starting to drizzle out of them clouds. So I was already wet. My sleeping bag was wet. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5739.04s)]
*  Everything was wet from packing up. I'm like, shit, there's, I probably should start hiking out. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5744.16s)]
*  And then, so I looked at my GPS and it looked at the time, like it was a pretty gradual climb [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5749.12s)]
*  all the way down into this creek. Like, so there's a glacier up above me and it's [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5757.04s)]
*  been melting for however many years and it's carved out like a bit of a creek. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5760.96s)]
*  And so it looks safe. And then I started climbing down and the first, I don't know, [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5766.0s)]
*  two hours wasn't too bad. Like it was pretty gradual, like a bit of rock hopping and slippery [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5772.0s)]
*  stuff. And I had one little leap to do. It was like two and a half meters or a meter down [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5776.24s)]
*  onto a rock to go out to this next rock. And it was like, there was a big glacier pool below me. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5785.52s)]
*  And it sounds weird, but you calculate and everything as you're going, you know, so it's like, [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5790.56s)]
*  this is the best place to jump down because if I did fall, at least I'm landing in water. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5794.240000000001s)]
*  And that's just a two second process in your head, you know, and that's happening all day. Like [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5798.88s)]
*  there's never a point that you can switch off in that country. Like you're constantly on the ball, [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5804.64s)]
*  otherwise that's when you're going to come unstuck. Anyway, what I didn't realize was the rock that I [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5809.04s)]
*  was jumping down onto had actually quite a bit of a slope to it. And it had like clear ice, [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5814.24s)]
*  a layer of clear ice on it. And you got to remember, I've got this chamois in my backpack [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5819.679999999999s)]
*  and frigging a wet, wet everything because I packed up in the wet. So the pack weighs a lot [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5825.12s)]
*  and it weighs a lot anyway, cause you're going back for like 14 days. Man, I hit this rock and [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5829.76s)]
*  my feet come out from under me that fast. It was just like full chest weight on the rock, bang, [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5835.28s)]
*  started sliding off the rock backwards. So I'm on my stomach sliding backwards, legs going first. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5840.96s)]
*  And I slide off the back of that rock and I've got a heavy backpack on. So it just pulled me. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5847.2s)]
*  I just started plumbing and down to this ice cold water and like back neck first straight into the [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5851.76s)]
*  water. And I just remember hitting the water. It pulled me all the way under like, like it was a [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5858.48s)]
*  good enough fall, probably six, seven meters down into it from where the rock slid off. And it pulled [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5862.4s)]
*  me under. I just remember my breath getting sucked out of me. Like, like, I mean, like it's [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5868.32s)]
*  crystal clear, like that blue water straight off a glacier and it ripped me down. And then sort of, [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5873.12s)]
*  I struggled to come back up and get to the surface. And by the time I got to the surface, [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5879.759999999999s)]
*  cause it was flowing pretty hard, it was pushing me into one of the drainage shoots from it. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5884.08s)]
*  And then, so I hit this drainage shoot, sort of scramble and trying to grab on. And then it pulled [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5889.44s)]
*  me down legs first as well, like down into the shoot in the next lot of water. Then by the time [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5893.6s)]
*  I got to that point, there was no, like, there was no going back up. There was no chance I could go [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5899.4400000000005s)]
*  back up because it's dropped me into a spot where I wasn't on the sides of the bank anymore. I was [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5904.240000000001s)]
*  stuck in this glacier melt. And then I ended up getting out of there and I got to the next point [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5909.200000000001s)]
*  and it was like a big tree, like falling down in the water. There's no trees on the side. It's [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5915.92s)]
*  just whatever's been washed down over the years, like a big stump. And I ended up wrapping my hand [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5920.08s)]
*  around that, my arm around that, get to my legs and then like weighed twice as much again. Cause [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5924.32s)]
*  now everything's full of water and soaked. And still have the pack on. Yeah. I still got the pack on. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5930.32s)]
*  And then, and then I got like got up on the rock then and it's just like one rock in all this water. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5936.0s)]
*  And then it's a long story. So I'll probably skip a few bits, but I ended up like fighting with it [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5941.5199999999995s)]
*  for the rest of the day. And then I ended up falling over another two times. One time I actually [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5949.12s)]
*  had to volunteer to jump. I had nowhere to go. I was just like stuck in this little canyon in the [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5955.76s)]
*  water and I literally had to come up with the guts to be like jump into the next water chute, [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5960.8s)]
*  which is just like a slide cut out of the rocks from the water running down there for millions of [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5966.24s)]
*  years. And I've still got my backpack on. I can't leave nothing. Cause that could be what saves me [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5971.36s)]
*  at the end of the day. I've got a sleeping bag. I've got other clothes in there. I've got [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5977.04s)]
*  meat from the chamois. I still, I had the skin from the chamois. I still had everything in there. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5981.44s)]
*  And I like, have you ever done anything where you fucking like properly got to convince yourself [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5987.6s)]
*  to do it? Because like I was, I didn't know if that was going to kill me going to the next step, [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5994.4s)]
*  or if that was going to save my life. And then, so you're calculating all that and then having to [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=5998.8s)]
*  have the guts to actually jump into the next chute of water and go down. Man, I fucking, [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6003.28s)]
*  I just remember just fucking doing it. And I jumped perfect. I landed on the backpack. I put [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6008.16s)]
*  all the weight on the backpack, slid into the next bit, just like pump with adrenaline, right? So I'm [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6012.16s)]
*  not even feeling the cold at this point because adrenaline's just going sick. And I end up going [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6017.2s)]
*  down a bit further and then I could just hear this like deafening sound of water. And I'm like, [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6023.759999999999s)]
*  fuck me dad, like what next? Cause constantly it seemed to be like, what next, what next, [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6029.52s)]
*  what's next? And I hear this deafening sound of water and I get to the fucking edge and it's like [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6033.52s)]
*  three, 400 yards straight down. Oh my God. And it's just like, like then it was like, no, there's no [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6038.160000000001s)]
*  going any further. You're like to go further is definitely deaf. You need to work something out [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6045.360000000001s)]
*  here, you know? And it got to the point, it takes a lot of courage to even be like, I need someone [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6050.96s)]
*  to save me. Like at least for me, because I've always, you know, like it's the way that you're [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6056.72s)]
*  brought up, the way that I was brought up, cause you know, I've never had the father figure in my [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6064.56s)]
*  life. I didn't have any of that. So it was always everything I do, I do for myself. That's why I [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6069.360000000001s)]
*  never usually ask people for help. This is the biggest ask for help they're fucking is. And it's [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6074.08s)]
*  pressing the SOS button on the emergency device, you know? And it's like, and I sat there for 20 [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6079.84s)]
*  minutes and still pumped with adrenaline over that time. I fucking like getting adrenaline talking [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6085.36s)]
*  about it now. And then realizing there's fucking definitely no way off here. It's time to hit the [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6091.28s)]
*  button. Like this is where you don't get to see your family again, or you don't get to do any of [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6098.16s)]
*  this again or live life. You need to hit the button and just fucking like still hitting the button hurt. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6102.5599999999995s)]
*  And you've got to hold it in for like 10 or 20 seconds. It was fucking the longest 10 seconds [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6106.96s)]
*  of my life. And like at this point, I've taken the backpack off. I took a jacket off because it was [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6111.04s)]
*  just so heavy and wet. And it's sitting there and I'm holding the button in for like 10 seconds. And [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6116.56s)]
*  it's like, then it's like SOS, you know? And it's like, oh shit. And then, but there's no reply to [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6122.88s)]
*  it or anything like that. At that point, it sort of just says the signal successful as in scent. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6129.68s)]
*  And that's about it. And it's getting late. And I'm like, I need to set up some sort of [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6136.32s)]
*  camp. I need to go for my pack, see what I can use, like what's going to work out here. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6141.599999999999s)]
*  And I pulled my pack out. And then like I've only got a spot that's like the size of one body [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6146.799999999999s)]
*  laying down to even stand on in this area. And it's barely flat. The only thing that's kept it [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6152.24s)]
*  flat is the trees falling off from up at the alpine tops at some point in its life, falling [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6157.84s)]
*  down there. And then all the shale and rock that's fallen off these big washouts with the water has [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6164.16s)]
*  like leaned up against that big stump. So it's like laid out a flat bit. And I could fit about [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6170.639999999999s)]
*  three quarters of a little one person tent on there. And so I set the tent up there. I set the [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6177.68s)]
*  mattress that I was telling you that I was trying to flag down the helicopter with. I'd set that [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6185.599999999999s)]
*  just on there. That just sat on there. And then I pulled the sleeping bag out and it was [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6189.52s)]
*  fucking soaked. Like the sleeping bag was drenched and I'm like, it's still going to be something. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6193.68s)]
*  And went for the rest of me pack. I pulled the shammy skin out and sort of laid that there, [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6200.0s)]
*  hoping it'd give me some warmth as well. And I've like stripped down then all the like bigger layers [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6204.64s)]
*  to try and get that off me. And I climbed in this wet cold sleeping bag, which is the worst feel [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6210.8s)]
*  and fucking ever in that situation. Like you do, you start, you're starting to think like this is, [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6216.88s)]
*  this is the end, this might be death. And I climbed in there, I was trying to get warm. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6221.36s)]
*  And then I kept looking at that signal by my phone, like it's through my phone. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6227.6s)]
*  My phone, it's usually through my phone, sorry, my phone had already died. So it's just for the [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6232.24s)]
*  little device. And remember the old phones, how you had to go for the fucking alphabet on them to [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6237.52s)]
*  type a message. I'm trying to type a message to my buddy that was keeping tabs on me as all this [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6241.68s)]
*  was happening. And the message just went out as in I need help. And he like, I've been around this [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6247.280000000001s)]
*  dude for forever. He's one of my best friends. So he knows what I'm like. He knows if I'm like, [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6254.08s)]
*  I fucking need help, that it's not good, you know? And that message, I didn't know if it went out or [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6258.400000000001s)]
*  not. I had to turn it off because I had like four or 5% in it. So I shut it down. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6264.56s)]
*  Anyway, I'm laying in there, laying in there. And then obviously the adrenaline's [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6270.0s)]
*  calming off. And I think I dozed off for a little while, it might have been 40 minutes or so, [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6274.24s)]
*  it's like a power nap. And I woke up and my body was just quivering flat out, like, like from [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6280.32s)]
*  fucking deep in it was just quivering flat out. And that feels like death. That probably that [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6288.64s)]
*  properly that actually scared me. Because like, I couldn't stop, I was just fucking quivering [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6296.08s)]
*  flat out like hyper like, my core is trying to warm back up. Yeah. And it took me to took me a [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6301.76s)]
*  little while to think about that. Because I, I shut I ended up shutting myself down, I stopped [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6307.2s)]
*  myself shaking. And then I was like, you fucking idiot. That's exactly what your body's supposed [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6311.36s)]
*  to do. It's trying to warm up. And then I sort of loosened up again, and started shaking. And then [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6315.92s)]
*  I went to move this arm and this leg and they wouldn't move. Like I couldn't move them. And [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6321.2s)]
*  then I was like, oh shit, like as in the adrenaline, it was from that first fall, I think, [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6326.08s)]
*  or it was from the jump that I did. I don't know if I'd bruised it. I don't know if it's about [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6330.8s)]
*  nearly hypothermic. I don't know what really happened there. I just I just couldn't move [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6338.32s)]
*  that leg. And I couldn't move this arm. So then that scared me a bit too. And I started thinking [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6342.72s)]
*  about Kim and the kids and like, like shook me up. And then and I got teary as well, which was [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6347.76s)]
*  weird because then I fucking warmed up. Like when all that happened, I was starting to warm up. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6354.08s)]
*  Anyway, I tried to sleep you can't sleep here in a wet sleeping bag. It's free. Like everything's [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6359.52s)]
*  fucking frozen around you. There's fucking rocks rolling from the top of the fucking mountain down [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6363.360000000001s)]
*  into the river. What the creek that's now turned into a river, there's rocks rolling down there. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6368.08s)]
*  You listen to that all night. There's like smaller debris and rocks hitting the tent. It's just like, [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6372.56s)]
*  and you can't move because I'm on this pad this big. Anyway, I don't even know how but the morning [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6377.28s)]
*  came at some point. I got up turn the GPS back on. No, there was no message, no nothing. So I hit [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6384.16s)]
*  the SOS one last time and I held it in. Nothing, nothing. I think I sat around for the first couple [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6390.8s)]
*  of hours of morning, like just holding me chest and stuff like that trying to get warm again. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6398.32s)]
*  And I got to the point and it's like, no one's coming for you. Like it's fucking on you. And that [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6402.72s)]
*  was the best thing that happened to me because it was almost like I hit the button and it was almost [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6410.240000000001s)]
*  like a give up as in like, Oh, someone's coming for me. It's fine. You know, and then it wasn't [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6414.72s)]
*  till I realised and said to myself, no one's fucking coming. Just fucking get up and do something. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6419.92s)]
*  And I was like, I'm fucking going to start a fire. Even if it takes me half a day, [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6426.400000000001s)]
*  at least this is turning. Let's try and start a fire. Let's do something, you know, like [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6430.88s)]
*  fucking stay in it. And then so I started pulling all the different rubbish out of me bag that I [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6435.92s)]
*  carried from the trip. I started piling that up. There's like no branches or anything around. So [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6440.88s)]
*  then I'm back at that tree where my tent was. And I'm trying to carve into that tree like to [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6447.92s)]
*  try and get into the middle of it, try and find some dry cause it's, you know, it's been raining [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6452.96s)]
*  for a day and a half now, maybe even longer down low. Cause I descended so far down. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6456.64s)]
*  And then I'm trying to get in there and I'm like, I'll burn the tent. I'll burn. What else can I [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6463.4400000000005s)]
*  burn? You know, I started thinking about all the things that I can burn. I'm like, yeah, if you're [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6468.0s)]
*  here for another night, you can't, you can't burn any of that. So I left the tent set up, left the [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6471.4400000000005s)]
*  shammie skin in there. And then I just got it to the point where I was like, I could probably start [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6477.280000000001s)]
*  a fire now. It's not going to last long cause there's no wood on it. It's just all, you know, [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6483.04s)]
*  trash that I had in my bag. And then I started thinking, what else can I do? I'm like, you know, [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6486.72s)]
*  I'm going to build a fucking helicopter pad because there was no, you know, it was all sheer, [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6491.36s)]
*  like no commercial helicopter could live the land there. Only a rescue helicopter at that point [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6496.0s)]
*  could pick me up from where I was because they, you know, they could drop down a rope and lift me [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6501.84s)]
*  up. But if I build an actual pad, I knew once the weather cleared, I could just call in the [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6506.16s)]
*  commercial helicopter to pick me up. So I was like, fuck it. And I'm, so I start grabbing like [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6511.44s)]
*  rocks. It's just rocks everywhere. And I was going to build basically a retaining wall and then start [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6517.5199999999995s)]
*  feeling it. It would have taken days to do, but I was just keen to keep busy. And then I was fully [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6522.16s)]
*  trapped. I could not go back up. I couldn't go out the creek. I couldn't go out the sides. I [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6528.0s)]
*  definitely couldn't go down low. And that roars the whole time right beside me, just screaming [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6531.599999999999s)]
*  that water pumping down there. Anyway, so I start collecting rocks and then I thought I heard a [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6535.92s)]
*  fucking helicopter and I was like, fuck. And this is like, this is five or six hours now after [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6542.4800000000005s)]
*  morning and I'm listening and it's getting louder. I just see this fucking big helicopter bank up. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6549.12s)]
*  This like, it's a fucking, you're in a draw system in between these massive mountains and it just [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6556.0s)]
*  comes cruising straight around. And I was like, holy fuck. Like I was like so fucking pumped. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6561.2s)]
*  And then this arm still wasn't working. I got this leg to start working in the morning. This arm [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6567.76s)]
*  still wasn't working properly. And I was so fucking pumped. And the dude comes around and he gives me [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6572.96s)]
*  the thumbs up. Oh fuck, man. My thumb must have been so straight. I was like, fuck. I was like this, [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6579.04s)]
*  you know, I was so excited. And then at the same time, I was like, I don't want to leave anything. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6584.24s)]
*  I'm fucking rescued now. I don't want to leave anything behind. I don't want to leave this [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6592.0s)]
*  beautiful place like it's been touched. So I fucking packed up the tent, jammed the shammie [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6596.4s)]
*  skin back in my backpack. I picked up the rubbish. I stuck that back in my backpack. The dude sort of [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6601.599999999999s)]
*  had to look around to make sure it was good to come down. He just come down on this winch dude. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6606.32s)]
*  I fucking gave him a big hug. And he's like, how the fuck did you get here? [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6611.360000000001s)]
*  And I was like, I came from the top and he's like, hold, cause I seen this fucking rock face [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6616.96s)]
*  that was straight below me. And I was thinking they wouldn't even take my backpack to tell you [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6623.120000000001s)]
*  the truth. And I'm like, just leave the backpack here. And he's like, yeah, but I'll bring it up [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6628.400000000001s)]
*  on the next run. And then fucking he lift me up. I got into this big bird rope, went back down, [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6632.96s)]
*  fucking come back up with the fucking the backpack and everything. And I'm like, how did you [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6639.5199999999995s)]
*  like, how did you know that I was here? And my buddy actually rallied the locals and they come [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6645.759999999999s)]
*  out as a training exercise because they didn't actually even get the fucking SOS that I was down [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6652.16s)]
*  there. So they come out there as a training exercise and pick me up knowing that I was [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6657.839999999999s)]
*  probably there. But that's how they had to hope. I'm not getting them in trouble by saying this. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6662.799999999999s)]
*  I doubt it. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6667.68s)]
*  Anyway, they fucking probably saved my life. So they shouldn't be in trouble, [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6668.72s)]
*  but they come out as a training exercise and come and pick me up. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6671.6s)]
*  What would you have done? [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6674.4s)]
*  I don't know. I couldn't, I, I don't think I could have physically went anywhere without [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6676.64s)]
*  greatly in danger in my life more than what it already was. Like there, I had a chance to [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6684.64s)]
*  survive for so long, but walking anywhere from there, there was such a great chance of fucking [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6689.92s)]
*  dying within the first couple of minutes. Down was a hundred percent death, a hundred percent [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6697.28s)]
*  death going down. All these rocks of ice all over them, sheer fucking dropped down there. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6701.92s)]
*  And then when I flew out of there in the helicopter, I just kept looking to see if, [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6707.36s)]
*  if I had done that somehow, if I could have went and cause you couldn't jump off the waterfall [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6712.96s)]
*  cause it just hits massive big rocks down the bottom. It's not hitting in big waterfall, [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6718.64s)]
*  big rocks down the bottom, pass that point was fucking dozens of spots as bad as that [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6722.88s)]
*  going along the way that there was no way I was going further anyway. So even if I risked limb [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6730.08s)]
*  and limb to go further, I was still fucked. And you couldn't get back up. Couldn't get back up. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6734.4800000000005s)]
*  I was, I was in such a shit spot and that shit spot. It's probably the only thing that saved [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6739.6s)]
*  you. It is the only thing that saved me. But the thing that saved myself, cause I'm like, [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6745.6s)]
*  you're fucked if you go beyond here, this is, this is where you stay. You know, this is, [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6750.64s)]
*  this is as far as you go, you know? So the SOS message that I sent out, the international rescue [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6754.72s)]
*  center got that message. One guy got that message. Then they tried to call me on my mobile phone [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6762.400000000001s)]
*  number. I'm fucking hitting the GPS, fucking SOS cause your phone don't work. Otherwise I would [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6767.200000000001s)]
*  have called authorities off my phone and sent me an email to be like, we didn't get the message [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6772.72s)]
*  correctly. We're not sure where exactly where you are. And it's just like, well, at least send [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6777.6s)]
*  one. And then the dude went on a fucking two hour lunch break. Isn't that insane? I was reassured [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6780.8s)]
*  afterwards that they put all their stuff through training again. So that wouldn't happen again. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6787.76s)]
*  So hopefully I've saved someone else along the line. That sounds like a terrible place to visit. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6793.84s)]
*  They said, do you want to go to the hospital or do you feel okay? And I said, I feel okay. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6799.6s)]
*  And they dropped me back at my vehicle, which was parked at like sort of like a trailhead. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6804.08s)]
*  And I got out of the flight and then I, and my bag was on the ground. So I hadn't even lifted the [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6809.120000000001s)]
*  bag up yet. And I leant down to get the bag and I just fucking crippled. Like my back was like [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6814.64s)]
*  fucked, fucked up. And I got back to Australia and I went into the hospital because I'm like, [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6821.360000000001s)]
*  like it feels like my bladder is about the burst. My back's all fucked up. I can't move. I was all [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6827.200000000001s)]
*  hunched over. They did X-rays and they're like, yeah, you got lines fractures through your spine. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6832.88s)]
*  You're very lucky that it wasn't any worse. And it probably, I don't know, a month later, I was fully [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6839.4400000000005s)]
*  picking up dumb heavy things again and felt all right. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6846.0s)]
*  But yeah, so if anyone's like, what's, what's the scariest place to hunt? It's fucking New Zealand. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6849.76s)]
*  No predators, no nothing, no grizzlies, no saltwater crocodiles. It's still the scariest [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6854.16s)]
*  place to hunt. Like I've nearly come unstuck there twice now. You know, every year I hear about [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6858.96s)]
*  stories about guys, just a small slip on the mountain, but they just keep going and they're gone. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6863.84s)]
*  So yeah, skip, skip NZ. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6870.72s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6873.84s)]
*  Damn. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6877.12s)]
*  Four years ago, that story still works out. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6878.72s)]
*  Do you, did you ever think about going back there? [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6881.76s)]
*  You know, it's funny because like I've done that real sketchy stuff in New Zealand four or five [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6885.76s)]
*  times now. And I've shot tar and I've shot shimmy and I've done them in beautiful ways, like the bow [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6892.4s)]
*  walking from the bottom to the top and days in and getting them. And it's like, [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6897.5199999999995s)]
*  and I want to do it again, but like how your fucking time comes up at some point, you know? [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6902.16s)]
*  And it's like, and I'm, I don't think I'm any more sensible than ever, but [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6908.08s)]
*  well, maybe I'm a bit more sensible. That would make sense because I'm a little, [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6912.64s)]
*  I don't have to do that again. I will do New Zealand again, but I won't do that sketchy country. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6916.64s)]
*  And it's like, I'll do that because there's probably no one back there. Like that's what [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6922.8s)]
*  puts you there to start with. You're fully off the grid. You don't see any other hunters because [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6926.72s)]
*  that's all public land in New Zealand, but you're back far enough and doing the dumb enough [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6931.76s)]
*  stuff that people don't do it. And it's, it is, it's, it's, [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6937.92s)]
*  and you had no backup batteries. Do you keep backup batteries? [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6941.360000000001s)]
*  I do. Yeah, but they were frozen died that night in the tent where I told you I was in a shitty [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6944.0s)]
*  spot and I wanted to get the helicopter back in. That was a super cold night. And like, [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6948.96s)]
*  I have spare batteries in my sleeping bag to keep them warm with me. They still all died. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6953.92s)]
*  I got up in the morning and the phone was dead. My main camera battery was dead. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6959.4400000000005s)]
*  Then a battery bank was dead as well. Yeah. But that's generally what I do. I've always got a [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6965.84s)]
*  spare battery and you just sort of lean on your phone for GPS for, you know, these new phones, [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6972.400000000001s)]
*  at least in Australia now they've been trialing it. There's an SOS on your phone now. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6978.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's iPhones too. Yeah. And it's, and it's really handy [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6983.84s)]
*  because you get to pick your situation, you know, car broken down in the middle of nowhere, [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6987.36s)]
*  your immediate help. There's, there's different things. Cause I tested that out [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6993.360000000001s)]
*  not long ago in remote Western Australia as well. You had to use that? [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=6997.52s)]
*  Yeah, I did. Four car tires stuck in the middle of nowhere. And then, so I use that, [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7001.52s)]
*  got to tell them the problem. And it's like, like proper communications, [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7009.84s)]
*  got to tell the authorities the problem. They notified police. I told them of two people that [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7013.76s)]
*  I knew of that could rescue me. One of them was my eldest son. And then, yeah, he'd come out with [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7018.8s)]
*  spare tires and then rescued us like the next day. So we had a cold sleep in the car that night. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7024.24s)]
*  Me and a buddy Campbell, it's like a single cab too. And I'm like, can't, I'm in the front. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7029.84s)]
*  He slept in the back. Yeah. And then he got the punches. So I got the best spot. And then, [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7036.64s)]
*  yeah, me son come out. But if it wasn't for that, like no vehicles came, we're broken down on a [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7042.24s)]
*  road in Australia and no vehicles drove past us in a day and a half. Like it's remote and it's hot. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7047.6s)]
*  Like what are you going to, you've only got so much water that you can drink. You can't drink [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7055.360000000001s)]
*  the radiator water. It's got fucking shit in it. Right. So yeah, it's another quick and easy way [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7058.240000000001s)]
*  to die. And you're on a road in Australia, you know. Yeah. Well, you do so many of those trips. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7063.52s)]
*  It's remarkable that this has only happened a couple of times. I, I prepare, you know, [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7070.88s)]
*  and it's like, it mightn't sound like I was prepared that time in New Zealand and, [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7077.2s)]
*  you know, and, and on a couple other things, it's like, you're not prepared, you're not prepared. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7080.96s)]
*  And it's like, well, I am prepared. I was, I would have fucking died ages ago, you know, [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7084.72s)]
*  and it's like, you've always sort of got that back up. And yeah, I think you've just got to be good [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7089.04s)]
*  in those situations. I've been in those situations with other people and they panic and they make [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7095.2s)]
*  more decisions that are bad, you know. Yeah. And it's so, it's like, and it's realizing before [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7100.16s)]
*  you go in that this could be a part of this adventure, you know. But everyone's time comes [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7105.6s)]
*  up. You do, you do stupid stuff enough and fucking, yeah, you can only handle poisonous [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7111.4400000000005s)]
*  snakes for so long before one bites you. Yeah. So you're rolling the dice so often. Yeah. So [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7116.72s)]
*  it's like, I'm not going to roll the dice in New Zealand like that again. I'll roll the dice in [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7121.84s)]
*  grizzly country here. I know you have a truck that you have completely outfitted and set up, [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7127.92s)]
*  right? Yeah. The land crews, the 79 series, you can't get them here. I was actually thinking about, [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7135.36s)]
*  because one of the next projects I want to do is by land in America, build an off grid cabin, [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7143.12s)]
*  have a nice big truck here and RV and like live that American dream, you know. And so I was like, [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7148.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, I might freight my 79 series over here. Like it's fully decked out how I want it. It's like a [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7155.36s)]
*  frigging weapon, you know. Right. And I looked it up and got the price back and I was like, yeah, [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7161.28s)]
*  no, I'll just buy an American truck when I get there. Well, you can, you can't buy a 79 here, [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7165.36s)]
*  but you could buy an 80. An 80 series. That's yours. Yeah. So the old one. Yeah. But you got [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7170.8s)]
*  another one. Yeah. The new one's the same, but I've like extended the chassis, 300 mil. It's got [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7176.719999999999s)]
*  coil springs the whole way around it. It's like, the new one's like twice as decked out as that [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7183.679999999999s)]
*  thing. Again, it just needs a tray and a canopy. Do you have a video of that thing? I haven't [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7189.04s)]
*  posted much because it's not finished, but yeah. But of that one? Of that one? Yeah, probably. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7194.16s)]
*  Yeah. And so how long does it take to figure out like what to put in there and how to set it up? [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7200.08s)]
*  And like, like how do you outfit something like that? I've spent more time and money on that [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7204.72s)]
*  truck than I have time driving it and money buying it from original. So it's like, that's at least a [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7210.56s)]
*  year in the making, you know? And it's just like, it goes to one place, gets one thing done. And [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7216.96s)]
*  it's like, and you're trying to figure it out as you go to, right? Well, some of the best off-road [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7221.92s)]
*  stuff comes from Australia. Yeah. Like Old Man Emu, Shocks. Yeah. Yeah. There's fanatics there [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7225.84s)]
*  and these fanatics have started their own business, you know? Yeah. Like ARB's huge back home. Do you [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7233.28s)]
*  have ARB here? What is it? ARB. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They're huge back home. Yeah. I have my Land Cruiser [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7238.4800000000005s)]
*  here. Yeah. I spied it. I was like, oh yeah. Yeah. That thing's decked out. That's my apocalypse [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7244.32s)]
*  vehicle. Is it? Ready to go. Well, that's what mine is. Yeah. You know. The back seat comes out. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7249.36s)]
*  Yeah. It's removable. So the whole bed in the back behind the two front seats is flat. So when I take [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7254.719999999999s)]
*  it hunting, I take the back seat out. That's so good. I can store all my stuff. And if I have to sleep in it, [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7259.28s)]
*  I can sleep in it. And it's got heated seats and- Leave it rigged up, ready to go. It's got a big [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7263.36s)]
*  ass gas tank. Yeah. No, that's the same one. Yeah. No, I really haven't posted much on this. It's just [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7269.12s)]
*  like, I've just been building it and just, it's, yeah, it's going to be the ultimate, at least for me [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7277.599999999999s)]
*  in Australia. I've been driving a Tesla around here in Austin. It's just like, fuck. What is this thing? [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7282.5599999999995s)]
*  It's the opposite. Oh, it's the so opposite. But it suits people here in the city, right? Well, [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7289.44s)]
*  it's bizarre how fast it is, right? Oh yeah. Yeah. And just dead quiet and just while you go. Yeah. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7293.5199999999995s)]
*  It just goes, yeah. Do you have the cyber truck yet? No, I drove one. I mean, I saw one last week. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7299.2s)]
*  Elon had, I shot it with an arrow. That's the one you shot. Yeah. So like, obviously he's the owner. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7306.320000000001s)]
*  So he's not choked up about it. He wanted me to. Yeah. Yeah. It sounded like he wanted to see, [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7310.96s)]
*  well, he knew that it wasn't going to go through. Yeah. I wish I had a single bevel. That's all as [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7314.72s)]
*  soon as I see it. I'm like, dude, wrong arrow. Yeah. Yeah. I think I could have got in there [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7319.4400000000005s)]
*  and tried the iron will. I did. We did all these tests on that arrow. The Nexus Nexus [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7324.4s)]
*  arrows that we made with a solid broadhead on it, shooting all sorts of dumb, dumb things, you know, [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7332.5599999999995s)]
*  but like I had like a gas, like a solid gas can there and it would pierce that. And that's the [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7338.08s)]
*  two blade broadhead field point wouldn't pierce it. Just about every other broad that I shot, [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7344.96s)]
*  just snapped and crumbled or bent over. But what they actually struggled with was just pool glass. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7350.8s)]
*  Like the glass, like the arrow wouldn't break the glass from a pool, you know, like the pool fencing [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7357.68s)]
*  glass. And so it's not as strong as like armor glass or anything like that. The arrow would bounce [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7362.24s)]
*  off it and survive, but it took like four shots to break that glass. It would punch through any metal [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7368.24s)]
*  you shot of that, but it wouldn't go through that glass. Wow. I don't know why. I don't know how it [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7374.08s)]
*  handles that shock, but yeah, it was, it was quite incredible. But yeah, as soon as I seen it, I'm [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7378.96s)]
*  like, oh damn. I know that's all I had here. I was thinking if I had an iron will and if I had my 90 [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7382.56s)]
*  pound bow and I had a collar on the front of the arrow, I had all these thoughts in my head. Yeah, [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7389.04s)]
*  punch it. But I used a three blade and it just bounced right off. How cool is that though? [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7396.08s)]
*  Pretty cool. Cause if that was a normal car, it would have ended up in the door on the other side. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7400.72s)]
*  100% I wouldn't wear it right through. Yeah. Windows up obviously. So you're not hitting like [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7404.96s)]
*  glass through the window, but it just would have punched straight through. Yeah. No, those things [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7408.96s)]
*  are extraordinary. It's a crazy car. I mean the fact that he's decided to make it bulletproof for [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7412.24s)]
*  no reason other than it's cool. And then Dorian sent me like this link to this company that's [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7417.68s)]
*  making like the campers for the back of them now. Oh yes. Oh, it looks epic. It looks so cool. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7423.52s)]
*  But you only have a certain amount of mileage and that mileage dwindles substantially when it gets [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7429.12s)]
*  cold. Yeah. That's why it wouldn't suit me in Australia. Not because of the cold. No solar. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7433.52s)]
*  You can't really charge it with solar. Much more electricity than solar. You have to lay out a [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7437.92s)]
*  giant grid of solar and leave it there for a few days. Yeah. I feel like it makes sense if [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7442.320000000001s)]
*  you're got solar on your house, then you plug it in at your house to recharge it. Yeah. You know, [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7448.240000000001s)]
*  that makes a lot of sense. And so I looked into electric vehicles in this house that we're living [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7454.400000000001s)]
*  in now, cause I decked the roof out with solar and I was like, I'll put a smart charger and everything [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7458.56s)]
*  in there. We'll just get an electric vehicle for just doing the town staff or the kids are growing [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7463.04s)]
*  up. So they're getting their driver's license and you know, a nice safe car like that. But by the [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7466.88s)]
*  time I looked into it, I'm like, it's just not practical for me and the rest of the family too, [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7471.6s)]
*  cause they're always going and doing things far away places as well. So yeah, that's the thing [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7478.72s)]
*  about the kind of stuff that you do. Like you could never take a cyber truck into the northern [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7482.8s)]
*  country. Northern territories, it would not make it. Just sitting there on my phone, [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7487.28s)]
*  like waiting for it to recharge. You get 300 miles away and it would die. And there's nothing you [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7493.2s)]
*  can do. Whereas all my cars have long range fuel tanks on them. So you're good for a thousand [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7498.639999999999s)]
*  kilometers and just like, and it's a long time between fuel stations in some of that remote [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7502.88s)]
*  country as well. Right. And do you have to make sure that you drive a certain speed so that you [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7506.96s)]
*  don't burn up too much gas? Are you cognizant of that? No, not really. I've usually got plenty of [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7511.36s)]
*  How much, how big is the gallon? I mean, how many leaders is your tank? What's leaders? [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7517.2s)]
*  How many leaders is that? I've got one 30, which is the main tank. So 130 leaders for the main tank [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7524.879999999999s)]
*  and then 90 leaders for the auxiliary tank. And it's just on a switch. What is, was that like [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7530.639999999999s)]
*  60 gallons? 130 liters is how many gallons? Jamie? 60, 50. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7536.0s)]
*  34, 35. Oh, 35. That's it? Yeah. Mine's bigger than that. Yeah. Is it? Yeah. I got a 40. Wow. Nice. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7546.08s)]
*  Yeah. So you bought that like when the shit was going down in LA, I was starting to think the [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7553.52s)]
*  shit was going to go down in LA before I was thinking about earthquakes and things like that. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7559.28s)]
*  If you get trapped and you have to drive off road, I wanted something that was lifted, something that [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7563.12s)]
*  a real off road vehicle suspension, real power. It's got a supercharged Corvette engine in it. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7567.92s)]
*  Ready for COVID 2.0. Well, it was before COVID that I had it built. I've always been worried. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7576.24s)]
*  Oh, you should be. Especially living in LA. You're better off being worried and prepared. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7582.5599999999995s)]
*  Yes. Then not at all, right? I want to say worried. What I worry about, like a legit worry at night [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7586.72s)]
*  when I'm alone, and I've been doing this a lot lately, is global war. I'm really worried about [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7592.8s)]
*  that. That gives me real legitimate anxiety sometimes when I'm alone. Well, it sucks that [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7597.68s)]
*  that's out of our hands. I know. That's part of the reason why I think I worry about it. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7604.0s)]
*  The world has never seemed more haywire than right now to me. Yeah. Never seemed more vulnerable, [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7608.72s)]
*  and there's so much tension between this Palestine, Israel thing and the Ukraine, [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7615.28s)]
*  Russia thing, and then China and Taiwan. There's so much potential for chaos. There's so much [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7625.2s)]
*  potential for horrors. Sometimes I just really freak out. I think about it a lot, but more for [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7631.759999999999s)]
*  my kids' sake. Yeah, that too. If you have to provide for your kids, how? What do you do? [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7640.16s)]
*  How long before you're out of water? How long before you're out of food? How many bullets do [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7648.0s)]
*  you have? What do you do? I'm fortunate enough to be very prepared in that situation. I own the farm, [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7652.96s)]
*  and it's got water on it. Water tanks are full and providing for ourselves and things like that. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7660.88s)]
*  Well, if you could get to your farm also, there's so much game out there. You would be so long as [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7665.76s)]
*  these assholes don't keep fucking gunning them down from helicopters. Yeah. But for the people [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7670.0s)]
*  that live in towns and cities, it's just like, what's your option? Not much. Yeah. Not much. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7673.92s)]
*  It's such a precarious scenario because so many people have had things provided for them for so [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7680.4800000000005s)]
*  long. They have no skills, no understanding, no knowledge, no ability. They would have to learn [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7687.92s)]
*  from scratch while starving, and that's terrifying. Yeah, it is terrifying. And that's just assuming [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7693.04s)]
*  you're not getting attacked. That's assuming you haven't been invaded. It's assuming that [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7697.6s)]
*  you haven't been hit with a nuclear bomb and everything's gone. It's assuming the power grid's [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7703.28s)]
*  up. It's assuming there's gas to pump. There's so many variables that are completely out of your [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7708.16s)]
*  hands. And because of what's going on in the world right now, I've never felt more like things could [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7714.24s)]
*  fall apart at any moment. Yeah. Again, it's always late at night when I'm by myself. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7721.6s)]
*  I just think, because as a father, a husband, and a provider, you think you have to figure out a way [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7728.8s)]
*  to take care of everybody. How do you take care of everybody? And then there's the walking dead [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7736.64s)]
*  scenario, right? You've got to really worry about people. When resources get scarce, people get [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7742.08s)]
*  sketchy. As soon as people get desperate. Yeah. It's very, very, very scary. Some of these streets [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7747.52s)]
*  look like the walking dead already, man. Right. Like four years out of the country, and then coming [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7753.4400000000005s)]
*  into some of the cities that I've, like I've always said, like Salt Lake, Austin's the most beautiful [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7760.56s)]
*  cities that I've ever been to. And then, so it was really in my face when I come back here, I'm like, [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7764.8s)]
*  is this COVID? Is the current government? Like, what is this? And how do you battle this now? [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7770.400000000001s)]
*  It's fentanyl, it's COVID, it's the current government. It's, I mean, one of the things [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7777.52s)]
*  we found out about Los Angeles is the people that are working on the homeless situation are being [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7783.4400000000005s)]
*  paid exorbitant amounts of money. Like there's people that work on the COVID situation, or [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7788.4800000000005s)]
*  excuse me, the homeless situation in Los Angeles that are making 240 plus thousand dollars a year. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7793.280000000001s)]
*  And there's no incentive whatsoever to fix it. Yeah. And there's so much bureaucracy. Cash cow now. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7798.64s)]
*  They probably don't want to fix it. Right. Yeah. Well, they have no incentive. The incentive is to [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7806.4s)]
*  keep the problem going so that they keep getting these cushy jobs. That's what they have. That's a [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7811.679999999999s)]
*  sad statement. And there's no performance benefit. Like they're not paid based on the amount of [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7816.4s)]
*  homeless people that are moved into shelters and reintegrated into society. No, they're just paid [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7822.48s)]
*  because there's a homeless problem and there's a budget. We need to raise the budget for the [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7829.36s)]
*  homeless problem. We need to fix the unhoused situation. Sure you do. But what you really need [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7833.52s)]
*  to do is keep getting paid. And that's what a lot of them are doing. And there's no hope in sight. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7838.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And it seems to me that it's reached a tipping point that once things get so sideways [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7844.160000000001s)]
*  that people are just camping out in the streets. When you go to Los Angeles, like there's parts of [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7849.92s)]
*  Los Angeles, you're like, what the fuck is going on? Like this is not sustainable. I have a friend [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7853.52s)]
*  who had a house in Venice and in front of his house, 30 feet from his house, there's people [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7859.12s)]
*  camping. 30 feet. Like right outside his house. You've got crack heads. People are openly doing [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7865.04s)]
*  drugs and fentanyl and they're tapping into the power lines and shit and they're putting [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7872.0s)]
*  generators in these tents. Like they have no plans on leaving and there's no one to force them out. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7878.4s)]
*  No one to try to say, hey, you can't do this. You can't litter on the street, but you can pile all [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7884.24s)]
*  your bullshit on the street. All your garbage, human shit. And then you have places like Skid Row, [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7889.28s)]
*  which Mike Glover, he runs, I forget the name of his organization, but it's a preparedness organization [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7896.4s)]
*  where he teaches people how to prepare for the worst and what you have to do if something happens. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7908.48s)]
*  He said Skid Row was the worst place he's ever seen. And all the places he's been, [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7916.16s)]
*  all the third world places he's been around the world in terms of like just the sheer amount of [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7920.24s)]
*  homeless people, the open air drug use, no hope, no law enforcement, no nothing. It's just fucking. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7925.839999999999s)]
*  I've noticed the last two trips, just it seems to be a lack of law enforcement out there. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7934.08s)]
*  Yeah. Well, it almost seems like it's engineered. I mean, if you were a real conspiracy theorist, [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7939.52s)]
*  you would think it's engineered to collapse society. And I'm sure there's some very legitimate [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7944.8s)]
*  people that can't help being on the streets at the moment, whether it's from job loss through COVID, [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7949.4400000000005s)]
*  whether it's from mental illness. It's mostly mental illness and drug abuse. People want to label [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7955.68s)]
*  it as a job loss, but it seems like if you talk to the people that actually understand the situation, [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7960.72s)]
*  it's very little of it. Because there's resources for those people, but there's not resources for [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7965.04s)]
*  people that are like severely mentally ill. And also there's many cities that incentivize people. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7969.84s)]
*  They actually give people money to stay homeless. They pay them. They give them a monthly stipend [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7975.68s)]
*  and they live on the street and they get like 600 bucks a month and they- [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7982.0s)]
*  Something needs to change in the system, eh? [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7985.6s)]
*  And the thing is these fucking people keep voting the same way. They want things to go the same. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7988.24s)]
*  I just don't know what they think. They think that voting any other way is racist, sexist, [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=7993.679999999999s)]
*  transphobic, Islamophobic, xenophobic. It's like they have this fucking ideology in their head. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8000.719999999999s)]
*  They're in a cult and they think their way is the only way to do it. And as long as they're safe in [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8007.44s)]
*  their home, they don't take into consideration what the overall effect on society, all these laws [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8012.24s)]
*  and lack of enforcement of laws. I mean, there's so many cities that all these businesses, like San [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8018.96s)]
*  Francisco, businesses are just pulling out left and right because they're just constantly getting [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8025.36s)]
*  robbed. They're constantly getting looted. You go to a drug store in San Francisco, [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8030.5599999999995s)]
*  everything's locked up, everything. It's all behind locks and cabinets and people just go in there and [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8034.24s)]
*  steal whatever they can. They can't stop them. They're not allowed to stop them. You're allowed [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8041.44s)]
*  to steal $900 worth of stuff. Oh my God. I've seen those videos. Fucking insane. It's insane. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8045.44s)]
*  It's a complete collapse of society. And again, it happens so quickly that you have to kind of [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8052.24s)]
*  extrapolate and go from here in 2023 and say, well, what does it look like in 2033? Because in [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8058.5599999999995s)]
*  2013, you saw none of this. Yeah. Do you remember any camping on the streets? Nope. Jamie, do you [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8063.919999999999s)]
*  remember any camping on the streets in 2013? I don't remember any. Some of it. Yeah, sure. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8069.36s)]
*  Maybe in Skid Row. Not a lot. There was homelessness in Skid Row. It definitely wasn't like it is here. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8075.28s)]
*  Nothing like it does. And not what I've seen in Salt Lake like last month. No, you see it in Salt [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8080.639999999999s)]
*  Lake. You see it in Minnesota. It's really bad in Minneapolis. It's really bad in Detroit. It's [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8084.24s)]
*  really bad right now in New York because they made it a sanctuary city. So then they have all these. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8089.04s)]
*  So the way the New York State works, Coleman Hughes, who was on the podcast before, explained [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8094.16s)]
*  it that it's actually a New York State law where you have to provide housing to homeless people. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8098.08s)]
*  But that was supposed to be for people that lived there. So these people have come here from [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8105.6s)]
*  South America, Mexico, and they've made it a sanctuary city. And so now you have entire [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8109.28s)]
*  hotels that are no longer hotels. They're just loaded up with these migrants. And, you know. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8115.76s)]
*  So the next president, if he's up to it, it's going to have a hell of a job in front of him. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8121.84s)]
*  Good fucking luck. And how do you get past the New York State law that says that you have to have [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8125.28s)]
*  housing for these people? You have to change the law. And New York is, they don't want to [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8130.8s)]
*  hire Republicans. Everybody's a Democrat. There's no, there's no one person that can do this job. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8134.96s)]
*  Like, like seriously, like there's not. No, there's not. But then the problem is, [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8140.48s)]
*  even with a whole party involved, they get fought against so hard. But how can they make up any [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8145.44s)]
*  ground to really change? Well, that's a giant problem with our system, this two-party system. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8151.04s)]
*  It's just so crazy. You know, and it's also a problem when people get into power and they [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8155.68s)]
*  want you to listen to them and do, I mean, you saw that in Australia with the COVID thing. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8160.88s)]
*  They just decided, I mean, I thought of Australia as this rugged, [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8164.96s)]
*  individualist place that's all about freedom. And then COVID came and it was just like, [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8169.44s)]
*  you have to take this experiment. It really came down to state to state. So I tell this story all [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8175.5199999999995s)]
*  the time. So, cause we're governed by the mines, cause that's where all of our work is. And then [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8181.2s)]
*  the government pushed onto the mines that to work on the mines, you had to be vaccinated. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8186.96s)]
*  Right. So, and the community that we're in is like all mine-based. It's a, it's a mining community. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8192.64s)]
*  So they all got vaccinated. They, I didn't have to, I didn't have to go to the site. I just stayed in [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8199.119999999999s)]
*  the office and my home and did my own thing. So I didn't have to get vaccinated, but all my workers [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8205.92s)]
*  had to get vaccinated or they didn't have a job because I couldn't send them to a job site. So [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8211.76s)]
*  that was even pushed down the main. We did a few things around that, but anyone that had to go to [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8216.56s)]
*  the mine sites went and got vaccinated. They still all got COVID. They still all spread it. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8222.64s)]
*  They still all had to have time off work because they were sick and a decent amount of them got [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8229.039999999999s)]
*  really sick after having the COVID vaccination and some of them long-term. So it did nothing. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8233.68s)]
*  That was proof that the vaccination did nothing. Cause I lived in a community where everyone had [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8239.199999999999s)]
*  to get vaccinated. At least, like I said, they still got sick. They still spread it. They still [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8243.279999999999s)]
*  had to have time off work. Yeah. They were lied to. They were told that it was going to stop [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8247.519999999999s)]
*  transmission. I mean, there's that famous Rachel Maddow clip where she was like, if you get [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8251.28s)]
*  vaccinated, the virus stops with you. It was bullshit. It was never even tested to do that. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8255.92s)]
*  It was tested to provide these antibodies. Does it give you antibodies? They never tested it to stop [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8260.400000000001s)]
*  transmission and they had to admit that over time, but this has just been the story of [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8266.16s)]
*  pharmaceutical drugs in America. The massive amount of profit that they can make by forcing [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8271.44s)]
*  people to do that, just that amount of money just went really far to enforcing this because [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8276.4s)]
*  so many people were on the take. Whether they were on the take voluntarily, whether they were on the [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8283.76s)]
*  take psychologically, because this was set up as the one way to get out of this and everybody [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8288.4s)]
*  believed them. I felt like Australia was like, oh, what's that country doing? We better do that. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8293.199999999999s)]
*  And it made me realize how badly the government's actually run. It's like the worst run business [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8298.16s)]
*  there is. And it should be the best run business model there is. And it's the worst. Because I [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8303.68s)]
*  would just scramble, no, you need to do this. Oh, COVID stays in the air for three hours. You need [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8309.28s)]
*  to wear a mask, but if you're eating or drinking, you can have it off. And it's like people sitting, [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8314.4s)]
*  so what's the fucking difference? It doesn't make any sense. You're on a plane ride for like [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8319.2s)]
*  six hours to WA, Western Australia, and everyone's got their mask on. And then when the food gets [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8323.12s)]
*  served, everyone's got their mask down. This is dumb shit. This is so dumb. And it's just like, [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8329.84s)]
*  what was the death toll from people committing suicide because they couldn't do what kept them [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8336.4s)]
*  mentally healthy anymore? They weren't comparing apples to apples. Also, how many people turned [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8341.36s)]
*  to alcoholism, drug abuse? Oh, 100%. And family breakups and stuff like that. It was ridiculous. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8348.08s)]
*  So they weren't. They were just... Well, they destroyed the economy in so many cities too. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8354.960000000001s)]
*  Los Angeles, especially the restaurant economy. Los Angeles lost like 70% of the restaurants at [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8360.24s)]
*  one point, which is just madness. Yeah, it is. And it's just poor policy making because that didn't [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8365.2s)]
*  happen in Florida. We were actually, me and Kimmy were in New Zealand in the back country when it [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8370.08s)]
*  really properly broke out. We'd heard about it on the news. Don't really follow it. Don't really [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8375.68s)]
*  follow the news, but you were hearing about it in China and things like that. And we're in New [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8380.16s)]
*  Zealand, me, Kimmy and a good friend Tyler in the back country. And there's one rise that you come [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8385.76s)]
*  up and you just get a little bit of phone reception there. And we'd touch base with the kids, [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8392.32s)]
*  each afternoon, each night there. And we come up to this rise and I start getting messages flat [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8397.36s)]
*  out. It's my son Noah and he's like, you just need to come home. You need to get home now. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8405.28s)]
*  They're shutting down the world basically. And so I get that message and I'm like, [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8411.84s)]
*  shit. And I turn around, Kim and Tyler behind me and the sun's gone down. So the ground's dark, [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8416.64s)]
*  but the sky's slightly lit up still. And I just see these 14 bright as fuck lights in a row, [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8423.04s)]
*  like leaving the atmosphere, like cruising across the horizon. And the first thing that jumps into [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8430.64s)]
*  my head after getting that message and COVID's gone mad is like all the fucking rich and famous, [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8438.4s)]
*  like Joe Rogan's on one of them ships. And I seriously thought that I was like, there's ships [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8442.88s)]
*  leaving the earth. It's gone to shit. And I was like, and I said to Kim like, holy fuck, what's [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8448.88s)]
*  that? And they both looked up and like, holy shit, straight away I'm on my phone, 14 lights in a [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8454.48s)]
*  straight line. And it's fucking the launch of Starlink. And so the sun was still hitting them [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8459.68s)]
*  and making them glow, obviously. And you thought people were leaving earth because earth was [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8466.64s)]
*  going to blow up. Yeah, it was fucked. COVID's real. Well, that's the real scenario. That's [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8471.439999999999s)]
*  the real scary scenario because COVID, all the people did lose their lives and the economy got [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8477.599999999999s)]
*  destroyed and it was a catastrophe and a pandemic. It's fairly minor compared to something that could [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8483.119999999999s)]
*  happen if we got hit by a meteor. Oh, 100%. If there was a nuclear war. Yeah. Yeah. So you do have [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8488.56s)]
*  to be prepared to go for yourself. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think they can pull the wool over our eyes [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8495.36s)]
*  like that well, but you know, it's a little bit like the- Not anymore. It's like the boy that's [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8504.16s)]
*  cried wolf though. Like what if there is something legit next time and it is a legit vaccination? [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8508.400000000001s)]
*  Like most of us are going to be like, nah, fuck that. I'm not doing that shit again. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8513.92s)]
*  Right. But what if it is legit, you know? Yeah. So it's- That's a long discussion. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8517.76s)]
*  It is. It's bad in both ways. Now there's talk of, at least in Australia, and I haven't read [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8522.32s)]
*  too much on it because it's been hard to find since, that there's a vaccination that cattle [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8530.8s)]
*  are going to get. And for anything to go to the stock yards, like the sale yards for cattle, [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8535.039999999999s)]
*  they have to have this vaccination. That vaccination gets passed on to people. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8540.96s)]
*  Yeah. Through food. Through food. And like right now I'm trying to buy acreage [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8546.48s)]
*  because I want to run unvaccinated cattle, like pure blood cattle, you could call it, [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8552.08s)]
*  and sell direct to consumer because I believe there's going to be a big market in that. And [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8556.64s)]
*  you don't take your cattle to the market to be sold. They get sold through you direct. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8560.8s)]
*  Because if that's something that comes out, I'm not going to want that meat either because I'm [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8565.039999999999s)]
*  eating meat now and I'm fine. I'm happy. Why am I going to change anything? Why am I going to get [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8569.76s)]
*  the vaccination? I've had COVID. If there's something that they can profit off of- [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8574.0s)]
*  They're going to do. And if they can profit off of forcing [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8577.76s)]
*  cattle to get vaccinated and these pharmaceutical drug companies can force these cattle ranchers [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8580.16s)]
*  to make sure that they vaccinate their cattle. It's fucking mad. It's really crazy. And it just [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8585.28s)]
*  shows what happens when absolute power corrupts absolutely. When money gets involved and there's [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8591.28s)]
*  just so much money was made. And now they're scrambling to figure out how to try to make [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8597.76s)]
*  that kind of money again. Do it again. Yeah. Oh, it's like they made hundreds of billions of [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8601.52s)]
*  dollars in profit and then it went off. Like nobody wants the COVID vaccine now. The compliance [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8606.4s)]
*  for the new boosters and the bivalent boosters is like far, far, far lower because everybody [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8612.64s)]
*  got COVID anyway. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. And so many people were like, well, fuck this. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8618.72s)]
*  Yeah. And look, it was shit. Like the first time I got it, it was shit. It didn't feel great, [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8622.56s)]
*  but I've had the flu before and I've had colds before. And then the next time I got it, [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8627.039999999999s)]
*  I had it for a day and a half. Right. But nobody ever told you how to get a flu vaccine. Nobody [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8630.88s)]
*  said you have to do this. Yeah. There was such a lack of information. I don't know if it was the [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8635.04s)]
*  same here, but there was such a lack of information. Like what are the home remedies? You know, what? [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8639.28s)]
*  Well, that was the thing. There was a lot of misinformation on purpose. And that's what I got [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8643.44s)]
*  caught up in that where they were accusing me of taking veterinary medicine. You guys are out of [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8647.76s)]
*  your fucking mind. You're literally talking about ivermectin, which is a drug that's in the World [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8651.84s)]
*  Health Organization list of essential medications. People have been taking, there's fucking billions [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8655.92s)]
*  of prescriptions have been handed out to humans to call that a veterinary medication. That's like [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8661.28s)]
*  saying penicillin is a veterinary medicine medication because they use it on animals too. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8666.320000000002s)]
*  It's fucking mad. And the media was involved in big business tactics that show you that our media [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8671.84s)]
*  is bought and paid for, which is really scary. At least in Australia, you don't have advertisement [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8678.480000000001s)]
*  for pharmaceutical drugs on television. Whereas they have that here in America. Flat out. Yeah. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8683.6s)]
*  And it's everywhere. And at the end they have to list all the side effects. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8690.08s)]
*  May include rectal bleeding. Whoa, whoa, whoa, suicidal thoughts. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8695.12s)]
*  I think it was like, you get my fall off. Faith in the government. Oh no. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8700.240000000002s)]
*  It might've been a Chris Rock joke. And he's, you know, he's like, do you wake up tired? [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8704.720000000001s)]
*  You need this pill. And it's like, who the fuck doesn't wake up feeling tired? [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8709.84s)]
*  Right. Well, that's the thing. If you can advertise for things, [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8713.04s)]
*  you could always come up with a reason why people need this. That's the Sackler family. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8718.16s)]
*  That's what they did with that. If you've seen that Netflix documentary on the Sackler family. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8722.64s)]
*  And, oh my God, the people that pushed opioids on Americans. We got the entire fucking country [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8729.28s)]
*  hooked on heroin and they did it by telling you, you know, pain, but what about breakthrough pain? [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8735.76s)]
*  You just need a little bit more, a little higher dose. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8742.32s)]
*  Your body telling you something else. Like I, and this is how I've been my whole life. I try not to [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8744.16s)]
*  take anything unless I absolutely have to. Yes. You know, and even at that point, I'm like, [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8749.6s)]
*  it's just a headache. It's going to go away. Do I really need to take something for it? [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8755.12s)]
*  Everything has a side effect. Yeah, it does. It's like, I'll take, [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8758.880000000001s)]
*  cause I'll take that to fix that. But then it's going to feel like it's going to burn a hole in [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8761.92s)]
*  my gut. Yes. You know, or something along those lines, you know. The one thing I have been trying [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8766.48s)]
*  to take in Australia, which is so frigging difficult to get is like a plasma injection. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8771.76s)]
*  I've had this fucked heel for like 12 years. Oh, PRP? Yeah. I've been the multiple doctors [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8777.76s)]
*  and this last one sort of heard me out. I struggle with, I struggled with it for the last 10 years. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8783.84s)]
*  What is it? What's wrong? I split my heel in three places. The bone. Yeah. In the bone. And then [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8789.04s)]
*  there's a scar tissue or a fragment of bone above it. Now to do keyhole surgery could make it [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8795.44s)]
*  actually worse. So they don't want to do that. And I don't want to do that because I'm putting up [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8801.36s)]
*  with it, but it takes the edge off a lot of my nicer thoughts when I'm hiking and hunting. I [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8805.36s)]
*  can't run anymore because of it. Cause the next day it blows up and my heels all twisted and [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8810.24s)]
*  everything like that. So they've been giving me cortisone. I've had two quarters on injections. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8814.400000000001s)]
*  It wears off after two days. And I'm pretty sure it only works for the first two days because they [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8820.0s)]
*  put a numbing injection in there first. So I don't feel it. Right. Lidocaine. It's really hard to get [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8825.44s)]
*  in Australia or they just don't want to give it. And the last doctor's like, Oh, it's really [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8831.84s)]
*  expensive. I'm like, I don't care. Like I want this fixed. That's my life. You know, I want this [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8835.04s)]
*  fixed. And I said, and that actually could kill me because it stopped me from having the right [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8840.0s)]
*  balance on that foot. And if I'm in sketchy country, that's the difference between falling and not. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8846.0s)]
*  So I want it good, you know, and the last doctor has heard me out about that, [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8850.8s)]
*  but he keeps giving me this quarter zone that keeps wearing off. You shouldn't get to any [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8854.8s)]
*  quarters on shots either. They're very bad for your joints. Yeah. Yeah. When have you looked into [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8858.72s)]
*  STEM cells? Have you looked into like, I haven't only like listening to you and you sort of being [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8864.08s)]
*  a promoter of it. Yeah. I mean, you've had MRIs on the ceiling. Yeah. Yeah. This, this places you can [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8868.8s)]
*  go specifically outside of the country that can really do some stuff, but they can do some things [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8874.64s)]
*  in America as well. You're talking about plasma. You're talking about platelet rich plasma, [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8879.36s)]
*  PRP injections. Is that supposed to be helping it or possible to help it? Yes, possible to help it. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8882.880000000001s)]
*  But I've heard there's no side effects that even works or it doesn't. Yeah. Platelet rich plasma [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8890.08s)]
*  doesn't seem to have any significant side effects. It's your own blood. They take your own blood. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8894.32s)]
*  They spin it back in your body. Yeah. Man. So like Mexico. Yeah. Tijuana is a really good spot. The [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8898.24s)]
*  CPI cellular performance institute. I think I've seen Shane there lately. Yeah. He just went there. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8906.08s)]
*  Yeah. He went there and got a bunch of stuff injected into his back. Yeah. Back and shoulders. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8911.2s)]
*  He's got pretty significant injuries. Yep. Yep. Yeah. It's a fucking sketchy. Yeah. I've had STEM [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8916.48s)]
*  cells. Yeah. I've had it in America. They've, they cured my shoulder. I had a shoulder issue that my [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8923.52s)]
*  doctor was telling me you're going to have to have surgery. And then I got, I had a full length [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8929.2s)]
*  rotator cuff tear. And six months later I went back out and MRI is like, it's gone. Wow. Tear's [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8934.16s)]
*  gone. Yep. And I don't have any problems with that shoulder anymore. I mean, zero. I lift weights [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8939.6s)]
*  with it. I do all kinds of things. It's very strong. Yeah. So that's the nice side of modern [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8943.92s)]
*  medicine, right? Yeah. Oh, listen, I'm not anti-modern medicine. Yeah. No, I mean. I've had [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8948.48s)]
*  multiple surgeries. Modern medicine is amazing. The problem is money. Yeah. The problem is not [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8953.52s)]
*  these people that are innovating and trying to figure out new ways to help people and heal [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8958.72s)]
*  people. The problem is that you have your scientists, you have your innovators, and then [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8962.16s)]
*  you have the people that are selling it. Yeah. Completely different human beings. And those [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8967.36s)]
*  people don't give a fuck. They might as well be selling cigarettes. They might as well be selling, [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8971.119999999999s)]
*  you know, nuclear waste. They don't give a shit. But it's fully promoted as good for our health. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8975.68s)]
*  Like we're helping you. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, they have, they have antidepressants that make you [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8980.64s)]
*  suicidal. So they provide you with another drug that you take with the antidepressant [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8986.96s)]
*  that is supposed to stop the suicidal thoughts. But those side effects for that also include [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8992.8s)]
*  suicidal thoughts. It's like, it's just wild shit. It's wild shit. And none of them, no one are saying [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=8999.919999999998s)]
*  that one of the main ways to stop depression is exercise. And exercise is actually 1.25 times [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9007.679999999998s)]
*  more effective than SSRIs. But they're not prescribing exercise. They're not telling people, [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9014.72s)]
*  hey, I want you to hike an hour a day. I want you to jump rope. I want you to do sit-ups. I want you [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9020.08s)]
*  to elevate your heart rate for 20 minutes, four times a week. And let's see if that helps you. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9024.72s)]
*  Come back in a month. Feel good about yourself. Yeah. Feel good about yourself. Change your diet. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9028.96s)]
*  I get bored super easy. And I think like boredom is the other thing that sort of leads to like [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9032.32s)]
*  mental health issues and stuff like that. Like people that don't have their thing, you know, [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9038.64s)]
*  I'm very lucky, you're very lucky. We've found something that we're really passionate about. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9043.039999999999s)]
*  And so you chase it. Yes. And originally that's the only reason I promoted bow-warning because I [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9048.08s)]
*  was like, who doesn't know this exists? Like if it makes me feel that healthy because of everything [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9052.96s)]
*  that goes with it, outdoors, exercise, everything like that. Yes. Who doesn't know this exists? [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9057.84s)]
*  Well, and they're all in the back country now, unfortunately, but you know, that's just a part [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9062.56s)]
*  of it. I still prefer to promote it and everyone know about it. Yeah, me too. You know, and someone's [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9066.48s)]
*  thing mightn't be bow-warning. It might be collecting cards. I don't know. Anything. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9071.36s)]
*  Anything. But hopefully something that's difficult. Yes. Having that thing, you know, [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9075.04s)]
*  where you're and that's what I keep talking about. Like I'm constantly looking, what's the next way [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9078.960000000001s)]
*  to test myself? I like those tests, you know, like I had that rough childhood, whatever, no excuses, [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9083.04s)]
*  who gives a shit, you know, what else is difficult? You know, I've beat that now. What else can I try [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9089.92s)]
*  and beat? You know, and I think that's helped me with other things in life. I would 100% have [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9096.4s)]
*  some serious mental issues and maybe suicidal if I didn't have my thing, you know, and your thing [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9101.92s)]
*  can't be constantly work, you know, like that does keep you busy, but I always find that wears off [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9107.199999999999s)]
*  over a certain period. Right. You need a passion. Yeah. Have a passion. Find something, you know, [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9112.96s)]
*  and if you don't have a passion. That passion keeps you healthy. Yes. Yeah. And if you don't have that [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9117.92s)]
*  passion, then yeah, the whole exercise, like going out of your way to exercise, yeah, it feels shit [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9121.92s)]
*  at the time. But then afterwards you're like, Oh fuck, I got that done. You know, I feel great. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9126.0s)]
*  You know, I'm looking forward to, you got to look forward to life, but then you got to do it all [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9131.12s)]
*  over again the next day. That's where people have a hard time. Hey, I'm not saying shit. I don't [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9135.44s)]
*  exercise. I just hunt and work and keep busy like that. Well, that is exercise though. You're doing [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9139.2s)]
*  it so often. Yeah. If I didn't do it, then I would exercise, you know? And I always feel fit. Like [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9144.32s)]
*  I'm in my forties now. I'm just like this last trip, I'm like, this is going to kill me. Like [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9150.8s)]
*  I haven't been in the fucking Rocky mountains for four years. Like, but it's like you hit day four, [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9154.4s)]
*  day five. And it's just like, you're used to it. Oh, you're loving it. You know, and it's just, [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9159.679999999998s)]
*  it is, it's, but I think people don't find that thing, you know, and it can't be just going out, [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9163.92s)]
*  getting, getting drunk all the time. Right. I think that wears off and the next day you feel like shit. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9168.72s)]
*  It's got to, I don't think people have the knowledge. They don't know what it is that [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9173.119999999999s)]
*  they're interested in and they don't have the time to find a thing. That's, that's what's [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9177.12s)]
*  unfortunate. I've seen people come in the bow hunting and drop straight out of it, but it's [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9180.720000000001s)]
*  because they're looking for their thing and it's not bow hunting. Right. You know, it's not hunting. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9185.28s)]
*  And then I've seen guys like that. I follow them on social media, obviously after meeting them. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9189.04s)]
*  And I see them move through different things, you know, and they are, and some people might [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9194.08s)]
*  be able to stick to one thing too. So they do a lot of things. Yeah. I've always thought if I never [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9198.400000000001s)]
*  discovered bow hunting, would I be like mad in the surf and instead, you know, and you get to go [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9202.8s)]
*  to all these different places, you know, and see different places. Like there's more to it than [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9208.16s)]
*  just catching a wave, right? Like catching a wave is your bull elk on the ground. Yeah. But there's [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9211.599999999999s)]
*  all the rest of it in between, you know, that you get to do, like, like find something that takes [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9216.96s)]
*  your places and find something that's complex that makes you concentrate on getting better at it. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9221.519999999999s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. Yeah. 100%. Like how hard bow hunting. It's fucking hard. Like you never fucking mask [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9226.32s)]
*  through it. You don't, you never master it. No, you just get better at it. Yeah. And it's, [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9232.72s)]
*  it's constant. It's never ending and you always have to practice. Yeah. Yeah. Practice constantly. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9237.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And so like I build a lot of things, you know, and I just, and it's the same because you [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9242.8s)]
*  never actually master it. There's so much to building something. What are you building? A table, [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9247.279999999999s)]
*  a house. Right. Like there's so much in between. So it keeps me busy. It keeps my mind ticking. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9250.88s)]
*  Keeps me muscles going, blood flowing, things like that. So I think that's the other reason why [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9256.48s)]
*  like that, not just that it's a manly thing to do. Well, I think human beings are designed to do [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9262.32s)]
*  things and we're designed to have puzzles and complex things, whether it's playing chess or [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9266.880000000001s)]
*  whatever it is, like human beings need things that are complex. It helps fuel you. It helps keep you [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9271.68s)]
*  going and it gives your mind something that it can focus on, which is what we need. And it used to [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9277.84s)]
*  be survival. It used to be just, I mean, your mind is designed to try to hunt, gather, find food and [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9284.08s)]
*  fend off enemies. That's what it used to be. Fend off predators. And now you're stuck in a cubicle [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9290.48s)]
*  all day and you're slowly going mad because your body does not get any of the things that it needs. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9295.76s)]
*  Your mind doesn't get any. I couldn't do it either. I know people have to do it because that is their [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9301.76s)]
*  survival right now. Right. The society we live in and I always say it, it's not my design. Like this [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9306.4s)]
*  is not how I'd have survived society. I don't think it's how anybody would design it. It's not anyone's [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9313.119999999999s)]
*  design, but it's like, fuck, if you want to do that, you need a vehicle to travel. I need fuel. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9318.4s)]
*  I need time off work. So I have to work. I have to make money. So then people get stuck in that. So [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9325.039999999999s)]
*  their survival is, cause they're paying bills and everything, is working in that cubicle, which fucking [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9330.08s)]
*  seems disastrous for the mind. Oh, terrible. Fucking traffic is disastrous for my mind. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9335.92s)]
*  Oh, that's terrible. Unnatural environment. It's such a weird, it is such a weird setup and system, [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9341.2s)]
*  but we're all in it and we're just got to adapt and fucking get on with it. So, but it's like, [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9348.480000000001s)]
*  what are you going to do or what do you aim towards? You know, my, originally when I went in the [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9353.52s)]
*  business is because I was like, I want to hunt, but when I go away hunting for a couple of weeks, [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9359.04s)]
*  there's no money coming in. How do I, how am I able to go hunting and still be financial? And it's [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9364.72s)]
*  like, well, I'll start a business. I have other people working for me. I'll set that up, you know, [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9371.119999999999s)]
*  put the years in to do that, to get to a point where I'm like, I can hunt money does keep coming [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9374.8s)]
*  in. So it's like, people need to find what, like what's their vision and aim towards it, you know, [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9380.48s)]
*  whether you're successful or unsuccessful, at least you're aiming towards something. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9386.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9390.4s)]
*  But it is hard. And I feel for these people that are stuck in a cubicle or in a situation they [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9391.92s)]
*  don't want to be in, you know, and it's just like, where's the light at the end of it for them? [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9395.84s)]
*  Not everybody's going to make it out, but enough people that are listening to this [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9400.0s)]
*  are realizing that they have to do something. And it's conversations like this are important [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9403.76s)]
*  because they hear that and they go, God damn it. This resonates with me. I got to figure away. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9408.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I got to find something that I do that's different. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9413.28s)]
*  Yeah. And it does. Like I think a big thing is it doesn't happen overnight. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9415.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9419.76s)]
*  People, even me, you know, and I'm like, not nowhere near famous as bloody anyone you have on [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9420.800000000001s)]
*  here, you know, but I'm sure you get a lot too, whereas people think they can just jump into that [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9426.24s)]
*  situation, but it would have taken you years and years to get to the point that you're at now. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9432.0s)]
*  Would have taken you years and years to get to the point of even when you first had a podcast. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9436.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9440.56s)]
*  And they don't see that background story, you know, because it's, if you go through my Instagram, [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9441.36s)]
*  you just see all the glory bits generally. I try and show everything, but anyone's Instagram, [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9446.880000000001s)]
*  you just see all the glory bits and you don't see that big gap in between. That was fucking hell. [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9451.6s)]
*  You know, and it was like, you know, I've fucking, I've been broke. I've had no fucking money [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9456.880000000001s)]
*  starting the business. And then I've had all those struggles. I've had all those stresses [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9461.36s)]
*  that you don't see. You just see Adam Green tree out hunting or fucking live in life. And it's just [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9465.84s)]
*  it took so much to get to here. So everyone today wants something to happen very quickly. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9471.679999999998s)]
*  They do. [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9476.64s)]
*  They have a short attention span and they want results instantly. They want six minute abs. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9477.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9481.759999999998s)]
*  You know, they want to lose weight in 30 days. They want all that. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9482.0s)]
*  That's me. That's me losing weight bit. I'm just like, I'll just eat clean for the next [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9486.64s)]
*  week and blah, blah, blah. That doesn't do shit. But if you look at things have like little goals, [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9491.92s)]
*  like tiny little goals. Even if it's like, oh, today I'm going to research this and have a real [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9497.599999999999s)]
*  goal. That's what's also important. Write down that goal, write down a checklist of things you're [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9503.439999999999s)]
*  going to do that day and do those things. That's been a giant factor in my life. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9507.439999999999s)]
*  Yep. And you just keep eating a little bit of it off and then the next minute you've got the [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9512.88s)]
*  whole pie. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9516.0s)]
*  Yes. Next thing you know, like, oh my God, I've done this for 480 days now and look how much [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9516.8s)]
*  different I feel. [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9522.0s)]
*  Yes. I love, it was just a little real or something and it was about if you spend this much time a day [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9522.72s)]
*  doing something that in so many years you're a professional at it. I can't remember exactly [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9531.84s)]
*  how it went, but all it is is just saying what you said. You know, you've got this big goal, [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9538.16s)]
*  you know, and you've got the picture and it's written down and it's like every day or each [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9542.56s)]
*  week or each month you keep tapping a bit of that away. Knowing that at some point you're going to [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9546.64s)]
*  be there where you want to be. And it's like, once you've done it, it's easy to think back on [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9554.24s)]
*  because you've already done it. I'm even talking about multiple things because you've already been [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9560.64s)]
*  at that point. You've already gone through that shit and you know what's on the other side of it. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9564.88s)]
*  You know, and that's like, I sum up hunting like that a little bit, you know, I've done enough of [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9569.519999999999s)]
*  those horrible backcountry elk hunts that you know at some point, even if you're not successful, [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9574.4s)]
*  you still succeed in yourself. You still grow. And that's the end goal and result for me. But [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9580.32s)]
*  because I've done it before, I already know it's coming. So it's easier to keep going through that [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9587.68s)]
*  shit. Kim's never been through that. She hasn't killed a bull. She hasn't had an opportunity to [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9591.84s)]
*  shoot a bull. So she's not enjoying those weeks in the mountains, but I know what's on the back end [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9596.88s)]
*  of it. And I'll say it every time. I've always been successful. I'm waiting to not be successful [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9603.44s)]
*  because that'll be even better for me. Like in here, what I'm chasing and mental health, [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9609.68s)]
*  not being successful will even be better. Because you just drive you even further. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9614.800000000001s)]
*  Exactly. What's the next year like? Or what's the year after that? Give me a couple of unsuccessful [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9618.960000000001s)]
*  ones. But you have to have some success to get to that point of wanting to fail. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9624.32s)]
*  Kim hasn't had that. My first elk hunt was on a big ranch in New Mexico. And I was seeing bulls [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9628.8s)]
*  every day. It was sweet. And it was still a hard hunt. You hunt with the bow. And then I killed [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9635.92s)]
*  one. It's like, oh, sweet. And then next year I'm like, I'll do this over the counter thing. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9641.199999999999s)]
*  Fucking Cam Haynes. That's what all Cam used to do. So it's like, I want to experience that [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9646.32s)]
*  and a bit more like Australia where you're just out on your own doing your thing. And I went through [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9652.16s)]
*  hell on that first back country hunt. And I killed one on the last day, like day 30 or something like [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9656.4s)]
*  that. But then I'd done that. And I had all the feelings. And I'm like, I want that feeling again. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9661.44s)]
*  And you have to go back to doing it that way. Yeah. And it's the same with a business. I've had seven [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9667.6s)]
*  or eight businesses now. And I know what the end result is if you keep putting in. So it's easy to [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9671.76s)]
*  start another business and keep going forward. Someone that hasn't done that, just this isn't [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9675.84s)]
*  successful. This is too hard. And it's just like, but you- [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9681.44s)]
*  That's also what separates the men from the boys. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9684.48s)]
*  Yeah. Yes, it does. I've been unsuccessful in business too before. Once you get past that point, [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9686.64s)]
*  it's actually not a bad feeling because you know what not to do. You've got that experience, [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9692.4s)]
*  you know? And we're not all the same and not everyone can have a business. Not everyone will [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9696.96s)]
*  have a business. Cause I know people that just like their nine to five job and they get paid [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9701.119999999999s)]
*  every week. They don't have to stress about chasing clients, bills, any of that stuff. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9705.119999999999s)]
*  So there is, there's different people too. But those people also need something that [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9710.08s)]
*  interests them. They do. And hopefully it's not sitting on the [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9714.24s)]
*  fucking couch, eating shit food, watching TV and drinking beer. You know? And it's like, [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9717.039999999999s)]
*  and you see so many people stuck in that cycle, you know? Yeah. But if they're happy, fuck it. [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9722.0s)]
*  Good on them. Yeah, maybe. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9728.16s)]
*  Maybe. Hey, we need someone- I don't buy it. [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9731.76s)]
*  No, we don't. I don't buy it. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9734.32s)]
*  Are they all the people that lined up for COVID injections straight away or not? [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9735.6s)]
*  I just think humans are inherently tribal hunter gatherers. And I think there's certain human [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9738.64s)]
*  reward systems that are deeply ingrained in our DNA. And you can either accept those and find some [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9747.199999999999s)]
*  way to satisfy those needs or you can live a life of misery. Or with Thoreau called, we said that [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9752.64s)]
*  most men live lives of quiet desperation. Yeah. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9759.76s)]
*  Yeah. You don't want to be one of them. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9763.119999999999s)]
*  No, hell no. That's most men. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9764.48s)]
*  Yeah. It's most people, but it's not you Adam Contrary. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9765.92s)]
*  I can't do it. I can't either. [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9768.48s)]
*  I can't do it. And it does upset me when I do see people doing it, you know? But they're of a [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9770.16s)]
*  different make and a different model, you know? That's true too. [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9775.359999999999s)]
*  But it is. It's sort of like, fuck, do this or do that. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9779.439999999999s)]
*  You can't speak to everybody. You can't. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9781.84s)]
*  But what you're saying is speaking to a lot of people. That's what's important. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9783.92s)]
*  My brother, it's always good to see you. You too, my friend. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9787.84s)]
*  Thanks for coming out here. Thank you for having me on. [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9789.76s)]
*  How long are you down for? How many more days? [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9790.88s)]
*  I got about another week and a half or so. Oh, okay. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9793.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. You know what? I'm going to get you into Waste Well and see if they could do [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9796.4s)]
*  something with your heel while you're in town. Really? That would be sick. [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9800.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Now that I know that you're here. Okay. [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9803.6s)]
*  Legend. Thank you, brother. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9805.36s)]
*  Good to see you, my brother. All right. Bye, everybody. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CerRv90Zc&t=9807.2s)]
