**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6.0s)]
*  Good to see you brother. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=10.0s)]
*  Good to see you too. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=15.0s)]
*  We were talking about golf and Jamie who's a full blown addict. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=16.0s)]
*  What's up? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=20.0s)]
*  What's up? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=21.0s)]
*  What's up? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=22.0s)]
*  I feel like everyone is now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=23.0s)]
*  So you're saying Gagey's fully hooked. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=25.0s)]
*  Oh, fully hooked. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=27.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=28.0s)]
*  He, yeah, I don't know. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=29.0s)]
*  Do you know what Fanatics Fest is? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=31.0s)]
*  No. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=33.0s)]
*  So Fanatics Fest is, I was just at it on Sunday, but it's just like, it's like kind of like Comic-Con, but for athletes. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=34.0s)]
*  And Gagey got to do like the Fanatics game, which is like a celebrity thing where it's like 50 pro athletes do it, 50 normal people and they compete in a bunch of sports or whatever. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=40.0s)]
*  He said he won because he was good at golf. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=50.0s)]
*  So the fucking guy won a Ferrari because he got second place. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=52.0s)]
*  Tom Brady got first. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=55.0s)]
*  He got a million dollars and then like a normal like non-professional athlete got third place, got like 200K. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=57.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=63.0s)]
*  He got a Ferrari? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=64.0s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=65.0s)]
*  Golf got him. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=66.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=67.0s)]
*  Golf got him for this fucking Ferrari. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=68.0s)]
*  I think he took. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=69.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=70.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=71.0s)]
*  So he's so that kind of just enforced his addiction more than. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=72.0s)]
*  Damn, he's that good? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=75.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's pretty good. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=77.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know shit about golf, but from what I know. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=78.0s)]
*  Daniel told me, DC told me that he started off and he was just kind of OK, but over the time between the Holloway fight and his fight with Fazeve, he didn't do anything but play golf for a year. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=80.0s)]
*  He played like 260 days in a row. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=91.0s)]
*  And he said his handicap just kept getting better and better and better and better. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=94.0s)]
*  He said the next time he played him, he's like, holy shit, he's really good now. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=97.0s)]
*  Sounds about right. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=101.0s)]
*  Makes sense, though. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=102.0s)]
*  He's a psycho. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=103.0s)]
*  He is a psycho. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=104.0s)]
*  Completely dedicated to something. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=105.0s)]
*  And he's single. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=107.0s)]
*  He's going to excel. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=108.0s)]
*  If that guy gets his mind on something, he's going to excel. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=109.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's a he's a unique dude for sure. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=113.0s)]
*  I really liked because obviously, you know, I started working with Whitman not too long ago. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=115.0s)]
*  I really enjoyed getting to know like that crew like Trevor, Gagey, Trevor is a unique guy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=119.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=125.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=126.0s)]
*  All of those guys are pretty unique in their own way. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=127.0s)]
*  He makes the best fucking MMA gloves that have ever been made. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=128.0s)]
*  And the UFC should have bought them out a long time ago. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=132.0s)]
*  I think he wanted some crazy amount of money or something. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=135.0s)]
*  I think it was like some nutty deal. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=138.0s)]
*  Unfortunate. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=140.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=141.0s)]
*  You know, I know they should have just licensed it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=142.0s)]
*  They should have just made some sort of a deal like you will sell the gloves. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=144.0s)]
*  You make the money. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=148.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=149.0s)]
*  Let's just get the athletes the best gloves bought. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=150.0s)]
*  They're so much better. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=152.0s)]
*  They're way better. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=153.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=154.0s)]
*  The foaming them is really good. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=155.0s)]
*  I mean, shape is better. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=156.0s)]
*  The protection of your hands is better. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=157.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=159.0s)]
*  Trevor is one of those guys where I'm kind of similar to like most things aren't stimulating. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=160.0s)]
*  Like TV kind of playing on my phone isn't really super stimulating to me. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=164.0s)]
*  So like he's always like doing something. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=169.0s)]
*  So he's always like making shit. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=171.0s)]
*  But he'd be when I would go into onyx, he'd just be in the back like with a smile, like working on the gloves, like every single morning that he's there. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=173.0s)]
*  And the style that they have is real cool. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=181.0s)]
*  People keep asking me when they're going to come out with them. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=184.0s)]
*  And I think he's getting pretty close. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=186.0s)]
*  So I just really wish that him and the UFC could make a deal. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=187.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=191.0s)]
*  Because they spent so much time and money to develop those new gloves. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=192.0s)]
*  And then they threw them out. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=195.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=196.0s)]
*  I hate that too. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=197.0s)]
*  I like the new ones. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=198.0s)]
*  Did you? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=199.0s)]
*  I have really thin like my hands aren't massive like some of these guys. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=200.0s)]
*  The old ones are better for like if you have like a really thick hand, the old ones are way better. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=203.0s)]
*  But I have a thin hand, dude. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=208.0s)]
*  And those things used to fit me like perfectly. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=209.0s)]
*  Because the old ones, when you when I would make a fist, they would stick out like this much. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=212.0s)]
*  But the new ones, they would be like perfect. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=216.0s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=219.0s)]
*  So I can make a fist and not have this like really awkward big space right there. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=220.0s)]
*  But what is the what's the issue with the new gloves? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=223.0s)]
*  Like what did they not like about them? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=226.0s)]
*  I honestly don't know. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=228.0s)]
*  I think some people were just complaining probably because they were just guys with thicker hands. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=230.0s)]
*  Because that's what it would come down to. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=234.0s)]
*  There was no other reason that it was. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=236.0s)]
*  I mean the leather was different and stuff. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=237.0s)]
*  But I mean how important is that? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=239.0s)]
*  It can't be that. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=241.0s)]
*  And I think the whole idea was it is easier to close your hand. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=242.0s)]
*  So it was going to eliminate some of the eye pokes. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=245.0s)]
*  They were a little bit curved. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=247.0s)]
*  But honestly, I mean maybe I mean even if you bring it down like 10 percentages, I guess that's saving 10 percent of people's eyes. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=248.0s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=257.0s)]
*  But I mean it was honestly I don't think it was like significant enough to be like oh no one's going to poke me in the eyes when they're wearing these things. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=258.0s)]
*  Well I think the Whitman gloves would cover that because they're much more curved. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=266.0s)]
*  Those ones were curved. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=270.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=271.0s)]
*  And your hand is in a permanent position like this. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=272.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=274.0s)]
*  So for you to do that it's an effort. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=275.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=277.0s)]
*  Which when do you do that? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=278.0s)]
*  You only do that when you're blocking things or you know maybe you know when you're sliding an arm under to get a choke or something like that. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=279.0s)]
*  But I don't think they're specific significantly bulkier. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=287.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=290.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=291.0s)]
*  I'm not I'm not too sure. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=292.0s)]
*  Honestly I don't really recall where I think that that was a while ago when they were doing all that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=293.0s)]
*  So I kind of don't recall super close what the curved ones how impactful it would have been on grappling. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=296.0s)]
*  I think the idea of the new gloves was that there weren't as many knockouts which also doesn't totally make sense. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=302.0s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=309.0s)]
*  No. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=310.0s)]
*  They probably ran a number that was from like all of the years of the UFC and then maybe just when they started using the new ones instead of like just last year how many knockouts. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=311.0s)]
*  I don't think they would do that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=321.0s)]
*  No. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=322.0s)]
*  No I think but there were a lot of people complaining said that they weren't hard as hard as the old gloves. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=323.0s)]
*  I should have brought you some. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=329.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=330.0s)]
*  I mean I like some of his and I was like these are the best gloves. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=331.0s)]
*  Yeah for sure. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=334.0s)]
*  Just fucking a man. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=335.0s)]
*  Work it out. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=337.0s)]
*  I know they're good to train into like like you can actually feel like you can hit the person and not be like right. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=338.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=344.0s)]
*  You know because that's a pain in the ass when you always have to get like a stiff pair of gloves and then you have to hit someone and you're just like right. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=345.0s)]
*  Sorry man. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=352.0s)]
*  I know that. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=353.0s)]
*  But with these ones you can fire away. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=354.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=355.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=356.0s)]
*  How important is that is like having training partners that are that are conscientious and they aren't going to fucking blast you like the miles that guys take off of the clock when they're training is so big. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=357.0s)]
*  Yeah it's big. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=369.0s)]
*  I think I don't I mean we spar. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=370.0s)]
*  I spar pretty hard still. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=372.0s)]
*  I know that like not a lot of people are crazy about that but you don't get hit a lot though. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=373.0s)]
*  That's true. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=377.0s)]
*  That's the thing is you're slick. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=378.0s)]
*  Yeah that's like for a guy just like a fucking face first. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=379.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=382.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=383.0s)]
*  You know that's there's there's styles that enhance longevity and you have a style that enhances longevity because not only do you not get hit a lot but you're also like you're a puzzle. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=384.0s)]
*  You know you're not. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=394.0s)]
*  It's not like oh here he comes. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=395.0s)]
*  It's like where the way what's going on here. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=396.0s)]
*  You know there's a lot of thinking that a guy has to do and they're interacting. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=398.0s)]
*  You know you have so much so many faints and so many stance switches. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=402.0s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=405.0s)]
*  It's such a smart style man. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=406.0s)]
*  I love watching you fight. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=408.0s)]
*  It's like it's so you can see that the fighter if they're don't. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=409.0s)]
*  And by the way they're probably not used to training with somebody like you because there's not a lot of guys like you. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=415.0s)]
*  You could see how there's all these adjustments that they have to make on the fly that makes you think. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=419.0s)]
*  Yeah I mean I always really looked up to all of the defensive guys that I would watch like I know that in boxing defensive just winning the defensive battle is a big piece in boxing and the judges almost even score less. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=425.0s)]
*  But in MMA it's just like only offense scores. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=438.0s)]
*  So that's not really the way that I grew up thinking was good martial arts really because some of my favorite guys were Mayweather, Perna Whitaker, Nenito Dener, like all of these really awesome like movers that did a phenomenal job at protecting themselves. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=443.0s)]
*  But now man people I feel like even more so now people want more blood and more offense. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=459.0s)]
*  And casual. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=464.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=465.0s)]
*  Yeah that shit drives me nuts. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=466.0s)]
*  It does man. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=467.0s)]
*  It just drives me nuts. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=468.0s)]
*  And catering to the casuals fuck off. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=469.0s)]
*  Like whenever someone like booze and then they separate people or stand people up I go crazy. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=472.0s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=478.0s)]
*  Fuck the crowd. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=479.0s)]
*  I think grappling is really hard to understand unless you've done it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=481.0s)]
*  Like striking is easy to understand like okay that guy hit the shit out of that guy more than the other guy hit him. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=484.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=492.0s)]
*  Grappling is like it's a whole it's like super proprioceptive you know like a lot of what's going on in grappling isn't it's like hidden to the eye. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=493.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=503.0s)]
*  It's where am I sitting my weight? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=504.0s)]
*  Where am I doing this? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=506.0s)]
*  And yeah so it kind of just people just don't think it's cool but when you understand grappling like it's amazing to watch. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=507.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=515.0s)]
*  You know like Amarab for example who's obviously a guy that I watch a ton. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=516.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=520.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=521.0s)]
*  But you know it's such a good job with like the little nuance-y things in wrestling that's just like. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=522.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=526.0s)]
*  But it's hard to appreciate unless you really understand it. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=527.0s)]
*  Well it's hard to judge too. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=530.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=531.0s)]
*  Which is a real problem because there's judges that don't train and never have trained which is to me fucking crazy. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=532.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=539.0s)]
*  That's like judging a Chinese spelling bee and you don't speak Chinese. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=540.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=543.0s)]
*  Like who's nose is fucking winning here. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=544.0s)]
*  I know it. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=546.0s)]
*  They don't understand it. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=547.0s)]
*  They understand when someone's on top. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=548.0s)]
*  Oh he's on top. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=549.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=550.0s)]
*  You know there's so many like near submission attempts that I think should count. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=551.0s)]
*  Like I always go to the Olivera-Armand-Sarukyan fight because I think Olivera won that fight because Olivera came close to finishing him twice. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=556.0s)]
*  And Sarukyan stayed on top and he had a lot of control and it was a very close fight. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=565.0s)]
*  But I think those fucking moments where a guy is like at nine you know if ten is checkmate he's at nine twice. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=569.0s)]
*  That's big man. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=578.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=579.0s)]
*  You want to be there. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=580.0s)]
*  That guy got you there. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=581.0s)]
*  He's got a fucking locked in triangle. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=582.0s)]
*  Yeah you got out of it. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=584.0s)]
*  But still that's big man. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=585.0s)]
*  That should count. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=588.0s)]
*  And damage leading up to a KO or that doesn't lead to a KO is very significant in the scorecards. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=589.0s)]
*  But a submission that doesn't lead up to a submission doesn't count. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=595.0s)]
*  And I don't understand that. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=599.0s)]
*  You can't just count damage. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=600.0s)]
*  You have to count like near falls or near subs. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=602.0s)]
*  I agree. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=605.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=606.0s)]
*  And if you want to take for example too like even like a me and a TJ fight. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=607.0s)]
*  Like TJ was limping out of that cage and I was kind of you know like oh cool you know. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=611.0s)]
*  And I don't think that that should count for everything. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=616.0s)]
*  But like you're saying like the reason that he was limping out of that cage is because I popped his knee really bad. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=618.0s)]
*  You know like he had to spend the next 18 months making his knee better so that he could fight again. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=623.0s)]
*  And I was able to fight you know pretty shortly afterwards. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=628.0s)]
*  So yeah there's got to be something to that. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=631.0s)]
*  Like if you pop someone's shit really bad it should count just as much as a knockdown or something like that. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=633.0s)]
*  What do you think about the idea of like 10-8 rounds for like things that are known not just like OK this person won by a mile. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=638.0s)]
*  But like in kickboxing they do if you get knocked down in a round it's automatically a 10-8 round. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=648.0s)]
*  You like that for MMA or no? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=653.0s)]
*  I do but if a guy is tuning you up for like the entire round and you clip him and drop him and he gets back up and he's still OK. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=655.0s)]
*  I don't think that's a 10-8 round. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=665.0s)]
*  I think MMA should be a completely different scoring system than a 10-point must system. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=667.0s)]
*  Because I think the 10 we just stole this boxing system which is a great system for boxing because you only have two weapons and you only have your hands. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=672.0s)]
*  You don't even have elbows right. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=679.0s)]
*  Think about all the different factors in MMA and we're limited to 10 points. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=681.0s)]
*  To me that seems silly. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=685.0s)]
*  I think it should probably be 10 points for each aspect of the sport. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=687.0s)]
*  Like OK who landed more kicks? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=691.0s)]
*  Who landed more punches? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=694.0s)]
*  And then calculate all that shit up together. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=696.0s)]
*  You know who had more takedowns? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=698.0s)]
*  Who landed damage from the top? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=700.0s)]
*  It should be a comprehensive system. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=702.0s)]
*  And I think there should be more than three judges. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=705.0s)]
*  You know when you have a split decision and like some of them are so crazy you know you see like a five round split decision and they gave like four judges or two out of the three judges rather give like three out of five rounds and the other person gives them the whole five rounds. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=707.0s)]
*  Like this is too much variability. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=727.0s)]
*  There's too much weirdness to it. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=729.0s)]
*  And if you're a fighter especially in MMA because of the win bonus which also drives me crazy. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=731.0s)]
*  I think if you had three more judges, so if you had six judges, six judges would balance it out. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=736.0s)]
*  Six good judges. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=743.0s)]
*  So the ones that fuck up and make mistakes they'll be cancelled out by the better judges. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=744.0s)]
*  We could do like a submission or knockout only league. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=749.0s)]
*  That'd be pretty cool. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=752.0s)]
*  Because then you definitely know who was winning that one. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=754.0s)]
*  What would you think about a no time limit? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=756.0s)]
*  Yeah no time limit, submission or knockout only. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=758.0s)]
*  That would be wild. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=761.0s)]
*  That'd be pretty sick actually. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=762.0s)]
*  You could probably sanction that. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=764.0s)]
*  Old school UFC. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=765.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=766.0s)]
*  Yeah I mean it's UFC 1. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=767.0s)]
*  Yeah it wouldn't really pay off for me though. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=768.0s)]
*  I need weight classes in order for me to fucking, for my career to be good. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=770.0s)]
*  Yeah weight classes sure but no time limit within the weight classes. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=774.0s)]
*  Yeah that'd be sweet. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=777.0s)]
*  That would be pretty wild. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=778.0s)]
*  Yeah that'd be pretty crazy. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=780.0s)]
*  Because you know like two guys are facing off each other and they know like there's no rescue every five minutes. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=781.0s)]
*  And you go into it knowing you're either getting knocked down or submitted or you're doing that to the other person. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=787.0s)]
*  Oh that would be real. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=793.0s)]
*  But again the casuals would have a hard time with it because it would probably be a much more moderate pace. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=794.0s)]
*  Or unless someone just tries to go for it right off the bat. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=799.0s)]
*  Yeah that could be a strategy. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=804.0s)]
*  Sure I mean it does work. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=806.0s)]
*  It's like there's so many fights where, did you see the past the Azerbaijan fight? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=808.0s)]
*  I didn't watch those ones no. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=813.0s)]
*  I watched Curtis' fight and a guy named Mohammed's fight on my team but no I didn't watch the other ones. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=814.0s)]
*  It was Mohta and the other guy from Azerbaijan. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=819.0s)]
*  See if you can find his name. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=825.0s)]
*  Salikov? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=826.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=827.0s)]
*  I hadn't seen him fight before. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=828.0s)]
*  What weight class was it? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=830.0s)]
*  I think it was 45. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=831.0s)]
*  No it was lightweight. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=837.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=838.0s)]
*  Sadikov and Nicholas Mohta. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=839.0s)]
*  Nazim Sadikov and Nicholas Mohta. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=840.0s)]
*  Fucking crazy fight man. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=842.0s)]
*  It was so good that Dana White gave him double bonuses. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=844.0s)]
*  Oh nice sweet. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=847.0s)]
*  But Mohta landed a 75 punch combination. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=848.0s)]
*  Like I'm not kidding man. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=852.0s)]
*  He landed like and then Sadikov came back and stopped him. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=854.0s)]
*  Oh shit. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=857.0s)]
*  It was wild. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=858.0s)]
*  Like a wild fight. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=859.0s)]
*  Like a fight like that where two guys just fought and Mohta like basically emptied out the tank. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=861.0s)]
*  But Sadikov had fantastic defense. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=865.0s)]
*  Just kept covering and moving and just getting bombed on to the body and to the head. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=867.0s)]
*  But he kept, it looked like he was getting close to stopping. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=872.0s)]
*  Nice. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=874.0s)]
*  And then he comes back and you see Mohta is taking his big deep breath and whoo it was wild. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=875.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=879.0s)]
*  When that strategy works. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=880.0s)]
*  It works but when it doesn't. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=881.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=883.0s)]
*  You're in some shit. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=884.0s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=885.0s)]
*  The blitz sprint and very few guys. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=886.0s)]
*  You know we were talking about Deitchi and golf and I was saying that I'm scared of golf. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=888.0s)]
*  And you know you're like I don't have time for golf. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=892.0s)]
*  The thing that happens with golf is it takes so much time and it's so addictive. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=895.0s)]
*  That, it's going to take away time from other stuff no matter what you do. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=900.0s)]
*  And when you look at a guy like I always point to Marab because the day after he beat Sean the first fight. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=904.0s)]
*  DC went to his house to go talk to him and he was out running. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=910.0s)]
*  The day after. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=914.0s)]
*  Like there's a guy that does not stop. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=915.0s)]
*  And that extreme physicality and that extreme endurance because he is just constantly working. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=918.0s)]
*  That means something. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=923.0s)]
*  That counts. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=924.0s)]
*  If you take months off you take, you know like this was the thing that I was thinking about with John Jones. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=925.0s)]
*  John Jones said he needed six months to prepare for Aspen Hall if he's going to fight Aspen Hall. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=931.0s)]
*  So they were trying to make a deal and then he decided to retire. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=936.0s)]
*  But it's six months because he's not training. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=939.0s)]
*  Like at all. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=941.0s)]
*  He just doesn't train. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=942.0s)]
*  Like in between fights just doesn't train. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=943.0s)]
*  Which to me, he used to do that a lot when he was younger too which I always thought was crazy. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=946.0s)]
*  That is crazy to me. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=950.0s)]
*  I always saw guys do that like when I was in my 20s and like I would watch these really big fighters just not train. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=951.0s)]
*  Unless it was a training camp time. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=959.0s)]
*  I'd be like fuck that. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=961.0s)]
*  I'm never being that way. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=962.0s)]
*  I don't know man. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=963.0s)]
*  That's that's like a really weird one to me. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=966.0s)]
*  But I don't want to bash it too bad because I do know a lot of guys that do do that. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=968.0s)]
*  But look at John. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=971.0s)]
*  Greatest of all time. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=972.0s)]
*  It's like how did he do that? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=973.0s)]
*  I really don't know. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=974.0s)]
*  He's that talented. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=975.0s)]
*  I don't know how that works. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=976.0s)]
*  Like I wanted to make sense in my head that like the harder you work the more shit you'll get from it. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=977.0s)]
*  You know which is like true to an extent. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=982.0s)]
*  But then you have like these weird outlier guys that maybe have something more figured out than me that I don't have figured out or whatever. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=983.0s)]
*  But I mean that to me is like completely unacceptable in my head. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=990.0s)]
*  Like I think that I really hate when people say that they want to be something and then they don't do any of the actions to like actually do that thing that they're saying that they want to be. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=995.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1004.0s)]
*  So I don't get to walk around being like yeah I'm going to be a world champion. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1005.0s)]
*  I want to be a world champ real bad and then not do any of the fucking actions. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1008.0s)]
*  You know. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1012.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1013.0s)]
*  Then I'm just a stupid person you know. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1014.0s)]
*  Well I think John is just so fucking talented that he could pull that off. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1015.0s)]
*  Yeah probably. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1020.0s)]
*  That's the outlier. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1021.0s)]
*  It's like he was just so good. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1022.0s)]
*  He was so good. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1024.0s)]
*  He just he just he could do it. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1025.0s)]
*  He could party and still fuck guys up like when he said to Cormier at the press conference for the second fight. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1028.0s)]
*  I beat you when I was on Coke. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1033.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1035.0s)]
*  I saw that video the other day. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1036.0s)]
*  This episode is brought to you by BetterHelp. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1038.0s)]
*  Sometimes it can feel like you're carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders and for guys especially it can feel like you have to carry that burden on your own. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1041.0s)]
*  There's a lot of stigma around men being the provider to keep it all together by themselves. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1049.0s)]
*  But that's not good for you your family or anyone. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1055.0s)]
*  Did you know that six million men suffer from depression every year in the U.S. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1059.0s)]
*  And it often goes undiagnosed because of these stigmas. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1063.0s)]
*  Real strength isn't bottling things up inside though. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1066.0s)]
*  It's admitting to your faults and doing something to better yourself. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1069.0s)]
*  So go talk to someone a friend your partner family a therapist. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1073.0s)]
*  Therapy is an excellent tool. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1078.0s)]

*  This is the thing when guys are that talented. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1124.0s)]
*  There's so much they're playing with their food and essentially until you know like like I always point to with John the first Gustafson fight which by all accounts he didn't train. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1128.0s)]
*  Oh really? Yeah. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1138.0s)]
*  By all accounts. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1139.0s)]
*  Barely trained for that fight. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1140.0s)]
*  Barely trained. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1142.0s)]
*  Just partying. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1143.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1144.0s)]
*  He beat Gustafson and pulled it off in the last rounds which was really crazy but then comes back in the second fight and is like okay motherfucker now we're trained and just destroys him. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1145.0s)]
*  Just runs right through him. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1155.0s)]
*  Which God does he worship? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1157.0s)]
*  No right? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1159.0s)]
*  You need to start going to that church. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1160.0s)]
*  Well I think it's just talent man and it's also genetics. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1162.0s)]
*  Like both of his brothers are super athletes. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1165.0s)]
*  You know he's just a phenomenal specimen and then he's got a great mind for fighting. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1168.0s)]
*  You can't discount his NCAGE IQ because it's fucking phenomenal. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1173.0s)]
*  I do think two people have different wired brains too where some people need like cool down time in order for them to. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1178.0s)]
*  Yeah I don't know man. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1186.0s)]
*  I really I don't know how it works. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1187.0s)]
*  I spend a lot of time thinking about it. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1188.0s)]
*  I don't yeah I'm more on the other end where it's like I'm going to give every inch of myself to this thing. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1190.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1195.0s)]
*  You know in hopes that I get it one day. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1196.0s)]
*  But then I know a lot of guys man a lot of guys that are really successful that are just like now man I need my like off time. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1198.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1205.0s)]
*  That to me is really uncomfortable but I kind of got a little bit I don't like chilling. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1206.0s)]
*  You know like me and my wife were just in Maui a couple weeks ago. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1210.0s)]
*  It's like the first vacation for seven days I ever taken like since I was a kid probably. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1213.0s)]
*  Did you get stir crazy? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1218.0s)]
*  I got a little stir crazy. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1219.0s)]
*  I kind of liked it though. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1221.0s)]
*  Like a piece of me liked just completely being like oh my home my life doesn't exist back there. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1222.0s)]
*  So I liked it a little bit in that but I didn't like the feeling of being completely like turning my nervous system off completely. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1228.0s)]
*  That was like weird to me. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1236.0s)]
*  I like being like a little stressed or having something going a little bit all the time. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1238.0s)]
*  It kind of just makes me feel like alive or something. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1241.0s)]
*  I don't know but I didn't really like that feeling. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1244.0s)]
*  I was kind of ready to come. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1247.0s)]
*  I like didn't like that. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1248.0s)]
*  I liked it too. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1249.0s)]
*  It'd be like if I started playing golf and I was like oh shit this is fun and then I got to like do that more and more. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1250.0s)]
*  I don't really want to get addicted to relaxing either. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1255.0s)]
*  Well the golf thing is a six hour plus thing. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1258.0s)]
*  That's true. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1261.0s)]
*  When you're going like Jamie you know you're like Jamie's got a simulator out there so he's wacking balls every day. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1262.0s)]
*  It gets you gets in your blood. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1268.0s)]
*  But the thing about like relaxing one thing that I do like about vacations is that at the end I'm ready to go to work. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1271.0s)]
*  Like when I'm done when it's like day if I'm on an eight day vacation it's day seven I'm like I can't fucking wait to get back to work. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1278.0s)]
*  I can't wait to get shit going. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1285.0s)]
*  I don't get that. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1287.0s)]
*  You know when I was out there I was like I could stay here forever. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1288.0s)]
*  I was like fuck home. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1291.0s)]
*  I was like can we afford this? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1293.0s)]
*  I was like let's just stay here. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1295.0s)]
*  Isn't that it's a weird thing about momentum right. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1296.0s)]
*  Like when you're training really hard all the time you have this like constant momentum in your head of improvement. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1300.0s)]
*  You're like you're on the path. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1306.0s)]
*  You're in the process. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1308.0s)]
*  You know and you're feeling that and when that gets disrupted when guys get injured and they have to come back or they get sick and they have to come back. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1310.0s)]
*  There's like you got to like rebuild that momentum. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1317.0s)]
*  Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1321.0s)]
*  And get it going again so it's like a part of your mind. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1325.0s)]
*  You wake up like time to go. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1328.0s)]
*  Yeah I'm pretty familiar with like the process of like having to kick back into camp you know and I do realize that it takes me about two weeks to get like all right. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1330.0s)]
*  This is my normal life again you know which is why I really like training camp and I really like fighting more than real life is what I say just because it's like organized. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1340.0s)]
*  I know what I'm doing. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1348.0s)]
*  I don't got to think about stuff. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1349.0s)]
*  I'm not traveling places. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1351.0s)]
*  People like traveling. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1353.0s)]
*  I hate traveling. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1354.0s)]
*  It makes me feel like my life is moving on fast forward which I don't really like. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1355.0s)]
*  I like feeling I feel most alive when I'm in a routine and I have time to myself and I could sit and kind of reflect and all of that shit. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1359.0s)]
*  But but yeah I. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1365.0s)]
*  What is the difference between your training like regular training and then training once you get into camp. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1368.0s)]
*  How much like what is a normal day when you're not in camp for you. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1374.0s)]
*  It's all the exact same. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1377.0s)]
*  I'm just less competitive when I'm outside of camp and I won't if I if I'm like beat to shit dead tired I'll miss a practice. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1378.0s)]
*  But that's really the only time that I miss practice in camp. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1386.0s)]
*  I won't miss unless I have like a two week rule where if I'm like dragging really bad I'll make myself go for another week and a half two weeks until I'm like OK I do actually need a rest you know. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1389.0s)]
*  And then so I'll do that in camp. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1404.0s)]
*  But yeah I but outside of camp is pretty much the exact same. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1408.0s)]
*  I've been traveling a lot which I really don't like doing just because again like I I don't really feel like I'm alive. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1412.0s)]
*  I feel like I'm like fast forwarding through a bunch of stuff. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1419.0s)]
*  But it's been like useful stuff like seeing family and then like me and my wife going on our honeymoon or whatever. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1422.0s)]
*  So it's like normal life shit that I guess I got to check in and do every once in a while. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1427.0s)]
*  But if it were up to me it would just be like training camp life all of the time just because it's easier. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1431.0s)]
*  It's way easier. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1437.0s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1438.0s)]
*  It's easy. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1439.0s)]
*  I go to the gym. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1440.0s)]
*  I do my hard workouts. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1441.0s)]
*  I'm competitive as fuck. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1442.0s)]
*  I get to get that out of me. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1443.0s)]
*  And then I just hang with my friends for an hour afterwards. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1444.0s)]
*  When you say you're less competitive when you just normal training like is that conscious. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1447.0s)]
*  Like do you decide to be less competitive. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1452.0s)]
*  And why do you do that. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1454.0s)]
*  I do that because I can't. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1455.0s)]
*  I think that if I'm too competitive I won't work on stuff like it like a lot of camp for me is getting better at stuff. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1457.0s)]
*  And then the last four weeks is figuring out how to win. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1465.0s)]
*  It's not like I think that practicing winning is just as important as being able to practice a certain skill. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1469.0s)]
*  So a lot of my camps will be developing those skills. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1474.0s)]
*  But then like the last four or five weeks it's just I need to focus on winning each round regardless of who it's against or whatever. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1478.0s)]
*  I'm not like practicing a certain technique or doing anything like that. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1486.0s)]
*  It's just win win win. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1490.0s)]
*  Just doing whatever it takes to win that round. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1491.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1493.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1494.0s)]
*  Because that's an important skill to build. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1495.0s)]
*  And when you're less competitive when you're just training and you're not in camp you'll try things. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1496.0s)]
*  Be a little more playful. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1501.0s)]
*  Try to like sort stuff. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1502.0s)]
*  Try new new skills. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1503.0s)]
*  And I'm definitely not as far and hard as fuck like I do in camp too. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1505.0s)]
*  Like I won't do that outside of camp unless I got a guy that's been giving me a bunch of rounds in my camps and he has a fight coming up. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1508.0s)]
*  And then I'll like gear up to give him a good one you know. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1515.0s)]
*  But no outside camp comp like just less competitive. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1518.0s)]
*  I don't show up as early and get my mind right before. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1522.0s)]
*  When I'm in camp every single sparring session that I do I try to put myself in the locker room while I'm warming up. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1525.0s)]
*  I think that that's like I've had a lot of success doing that. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1531.0s)]
*  Just making my body make good decisions when I'm in a super elevated high intensity state is something you got to practice too. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1535.0s)]
*  I definitely won't do that outside of camp because that's a lot of energy. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1543.0s)]
*  So you visualize the walk out. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1546.0s)]
*  You visualize like stepping into the octagon all that. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1548.0s)]
*  Essentially. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1551.0s)]
*  It's not as so I don't do as much of. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1553.0s)]
*  I'd more so go off a feel a little bit more now where I'll be like okay I need to do this today because I know that I really don't want to do it. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1559.0s)]
*  Or I'll be like okay this day for whatever reason I'm really distracted. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1567.0s)]
*  I'll do a little bit more visualization mindful stuff or whatever because every day is different in sparring. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1571.0s)]
*  As you know where some days you're good to go right off of the bat and then other days you're dragging. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1576.0s)]
*  It's those days that you're dragging that I make sure that I'm like those ones I'll be like okay fucking visualize because your body doesn't want to do this right now. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1580.0s)]
*  And I'll put myself in that state twice a week which is has helped a lot a lot a lot. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1588.0s)]
*  I know for a while you were organizing your whole camp right. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1593.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1597.0s)]
*  Are you still doing that. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1598.0s)]
*  No I don't do that anymore. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1599.0s)]
*  That has actually been like a super significant piece in one my life getting a lot better and then to. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1600.0s)]
*  I think that like it I think it's going to transfer over really well into my next few fights for a really long time for a lot of reasons. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1606.0s)]
*  I was like really micromanaging over my stuff. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1615.0s)]
*  I don't like when people do things for me like I kind of like live in a way where everything is my responsibility and if I fuck up it was like on me regardless of what happens which is like a fine way to be but also it's not like crazy realistic either. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1619.0s)]
*  But that's just kind of the way that I am just the way that I grew up like it was kind of like take care of me type of thing you know and if I'm messing stuff up it's on me. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1632.0s)]
*  So I was like that for a really long time. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1641.0s)]
*  It was actually after the umar fight where I realized how in the way I got of myself in that fight. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1644.0s)]
*  How so. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1652.0s)]
*  Over doing it from insecurity a little bit. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1653.0s)]
*  A little bit over like that was my first camp with Trevor too and Trevor's a phenomenal coach. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1658.0s)]
*  I've known him for a lot of years. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1665.0s)]
*  He has a lot of champions. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1667.0s)]
*  There's no like there's no reason to doubt any of what he has going on or my other coach Carrington Banks or anyone really. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1668.0s)]
*  But because I kind of have this mindset on life or did you have this mindset on life where it was a man like manage everything like make sure everyone's doing their work like blah blah blah like. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1676.0s)]
*  After that umar fight I really got into I was like all right fuck it guys like I messed that one up I felt like because I was trying to be too micromanage you over this thing I started getting outside of myself. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1687.0s)]
*  You guys take over and the reason that I did that wasn't necessarily because I lost it's because I'm coaching a couple professionals now and coaching a professional is different than coaching an amateur. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1700.0s)]
*  It's like it feels like a lot more responsibility and I realized what was happening when I would try to help these couple guys that I was trying to help is that they they are too close to it the same way that I'm sure you get too close to your art as well like in comedy. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1710.0s)]
*  You're too close to it sometimes where you don't really you can't see things from a perspective that is like true and real because you're so locked into what it is that you're doing. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1725.0s)]
*  I really big time realized that that was a thing in my other guys so when I would try to help them and they'd be like hey man like I don't like they'd kind of get a little bit argumentative I'd be like you could keep doing that but I'm a I'm a thousand percent sure that I'm right about this you know but do your own thing and I started to realize like oh fuck that's what I do all the time. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1735.0s)]
*  I gotta I gotta stop being argumentative and just shut the fuck up and listen if I really trust these guys right and so I started doing that big time man and it made my it changed so much stuff for me. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1754.0s)]
*  I forgot who you fought your last fight. I fought Figgy last. That's right. Yeah. Figgy blew his knee out. Yeah. So that's essentially the same position that you got in with TJ. Yeah. Yeah. 50-50. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1765.0s)]
*  And what that that's like you're this this is all Ryan Hall stuff right. Yep. And so you're putting him in a position where if he doesn't know what you're doing and he tries to get out of it he's going to blow his knee. Yep. Essentially I like 50-50 a lot because one I get to learn it from the guy who essentially invented it and is the best at it in the world. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1775.0s)]
*  The only guys that I feel like can beat me at 50-50 are guys that train at 50-50 and so it's kind of like what it feels like 50-50 the position and just kind of leg locks in general if you really know how to do them in MMA are a spot that you can pull people into and have them be completely lost. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1796.0s)]
*  Because they have to think what do I do now and you're already moving. It's super niche to like understanding the position is super niche. It's like judo almost a little bit in wrestling where it's like okay cool if this guy's going to just wrestle with me great but if this guy has good throws that changes a lot of the way that I have to do things. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1816.0s)]
*  I can pull people into these really niche spots where I know that I'm going to win them. So 50-50 is one of those it's kind of like what jujitsu used to be a little bit before people started to understand jujitsu. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1833.0s)]
*  But now people fully understand jujitsu so you don't really get to like catch people in guillotines or whatever but 50-50 and a lot of the leg locks and a lot of stuff that Ryan teaches me and does is so niche that like you would need an absolute expert to understand it and I like get the fortune of having that. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1845.0s)]
*  Yeah that's awesome. He's so fucking smart too that dude is like his analysis of jujitsu and the way he's broken down different positions it's really exciting to watch. Is he fighting? I know he's had like nine surgeries or something crazy right? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1865.0s)]
*  Yeah it's like closer to a thousand but yeah he's doing good he says he wants to fight again I hope that he does. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1879.0s)]
*  Why is he having all these surgeries? Like what's going on? I think it's just one of those things where like you let one thing go and then another thing breaks and then another thing breaks and you kind of like are taping yourself back together and then one day you wake up and you're like shit I gotta like take care of this. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1886.0s)]
*  What are the surgeries that he had? I'm not sure specifically. You name it he's probably had it. I've never heard of anybody having that many surgeries. There's a couple knee ones a couple shoulder ones. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1901.0s)]
*  Honestly I quit asking after a certain point. But yeah I think that he's kind of coming back. Ryan more than anything I'm like a super conceptual thinker. Like I don't really like details like I don't remember names of stuff. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1913.0s)]
*  19 general anesthesia first of all that is so bad for you. So bad for you to go into general 19 can you go back up there what it says there? It says tearing his ACL the following years and many surgeries you just a specialist wasn't out of the woods just yet. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1927.0s)]
*  That is so crazy. Okay so he had to fix a planter plate so that's his foot got fallen on again had to have a tightrope surgery when the Pat Mahomes got and a lot of other people have had I don't know what that one is do you know what that is tightrope surgery? [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1944.0s)]
*  No no idea. ACL got infected had to have a couple of septic arthritis. The tightrope is actually allergic to the hardware they put in me some oh my god. So you had to have that redone. Boy came to injuries he said completely bulletproof for 15 years until his training camp for toporia where he tore his hip right before the fight. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1960.0s)]
*  Tightrope is used to stabilize ankle. Wow that is crazy. More than half the surgeries of ones where oops we screwed up let's do that again. Six elbow surgeries and five knee surgeries holy shit. Holy shit. Yeah I don't like taking any type of medication ever so that would probably really bother me having to be under that much. It would probably really fuck me up. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=1982.0s)]

*  General anesthesia is very bad for you. It's kind of scary dude. It makes fucking scary. I've only had a couple surgeries how many surgeries have you had like under the knife like had to go under? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2086.0s)]
*  Three knee surgeries under the knife I think those are the only general anesthesia ones that I've had. I've only had to do it for my elbow when I tore my tricep. You tore that shit off the bone right? Yeah it was pretty fucked up. But you still won the fight. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2112.0s)]
*  I did still win the fight. That one that was like a whole fucking thing though. I got bursitis in that elbow because I got a bunch of loose floating bones and shit in there. So then it just swelled up really bad and every time I've gotten bursitis I've gotten really bad staph infections in it. Yeah because I mean you got to think it's just like sitting pooled fluid in your body and then when you're still in the gym training and it gets like in your bloodstream or whatever it's just like it's like a swamp and then it just. Wasn't that what happened to Ben Askren? Wasn't it a staph infection that turned into a staph infection? Yeah. I think it was. I think it was. I think it was. I think it was. I think it was. I think it was. I think it was. I think it was. I think it was. I think it was. I think it was. I think it was. I think it was. I think it was. I think [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2131.0s)]
*  Oh really? I don't know. Is he doing OK? I never... He's not doing OK I mean. He needs a lung transplant. Oh fuck. Yeah he had I think they call it necrotic pneumonia. So essentially it was rotting holes in his lung tissue so they had to put him on a ventilator and apparently one after a few weeks he could literally do it and then he 물어 [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2161.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. He had I think they call it necrotic pneumonia so essentially it was rotting holes in his lung tissue so they had to put him on a ventilator and apparently one after a few weeks he could literally do it and then he 물어 [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2170.8s)]
*  his lungs is just gone and they have to replace it which is that's so crazy because then you [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2181.9s)]
*  have to be on medication for your entire life because your body wants to reject the lung [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2188.04s)]
*  because it's not your lung so you have to take these immunosuppressant so now your immune [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2193.04s)]
*  system is severely suppressed because you have to take immunosuppressant drugs in order [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2197.5s)]
*  to have this. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2201.64s)]
*  I have a friend who had a heart transplant and he's all fucked up because of it you [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2202.64s)]
*  know it's just like you're always worried about getting sick because your immune system [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2206.4s)]
*  is very compromised. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2209.92s)]
*  Damn that's going to change his life. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2211.34s)]
*  Oh my god he's still in a medically induced coma I believe. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2212.66s)]
*  I think he's out of the coma now like he looks at people and he can kind of talk a little [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2216.6800000000003s)]
*  bit but I mean this is all going on for many many weeks now and I think what happened was [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2222.14s)]
*  he was feeling like shit and he didn't know how bad it was and he went to a bitcoin conference [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2229.2000000000003s)]
*  you know he traveled and then it got real bad and then he realized oh this is serious. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2234.02s)]
*  So it was a staph kind of inside of his lung. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2239.24s)]
*  Can you see if you can find that if it was it started with a staph infection. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2241.3799999999997s)]
*  That sounds like it would really hurt. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2245.68s)]
*  Staph infections by themselves hurt really bad I couldn't imagine having it in your lungs [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2247.8599999999997s)]
*  where you're breathing into. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2251.3399999999997s)]
*  I don't think enough people pay attention to staph. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2252.4199999999996s)]
*  I mean how many guys like fight and they're on antibiotics it happens all the time. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2254.8399999999997s)]
*  Mirab like when Mirab fought Umar apparently he had staph on his shin and he was on antibiotics [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2260.16s)]
*  when he fought. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2265.64s)]
*  So dude the type of antibiotic that I was on I forget the name of it unfortunately but [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2266.64s)]
*  the reason I tore my tricep was because that antibiotic made my ligaments super shitty [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2270.8599999999997s)]
*  pretty much. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2276.8599999999997s)]
*  Because dude like I should never tear my tricep I'm pretty sure it happened when he was comoring [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2278.66s)]
*  me dude that shouldn't happen you know like maybe something else but definitely not tear [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2282.5s)]
*  my tricep. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2287.54s)]
*  So that's when it happened and then I was like yo what the fuck is that about like that [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2289.3599999999997s)]
*  shouldn't happen and then when I read into it a little bit they told me that that specific [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2294.26s)]
*  antibiotic it doesn't mess with your respiratory stuff like your conditioning as much but it [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2298.96s)]
*  makes your ligaments just really not good. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2304.36s)]
*  Oh that's terrible. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2307.44s)]
*  I know. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2308.44s)]
*  And then you have to fight. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2309.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2310.44s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2311.44s)]
*  I know last camp I didn't get one dude I was so happy. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2312.44s)]
*  I didn't get sick. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2313.88s)]
*  How many times have you had staph? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2314.88s)]
*  Not too many times but man so this time with my elbow against Font I got it really bad. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2317.2400000000002s)]
*  I was on one round of antibiotics for seven days or something and then it came back immediately [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2323.5s)]
*  so then I was on it for two more weeks and then I got off it the week before the fight [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2328.54s)]
*  so I was essentially on it for like a month which sucks and then against Umar I got it [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2331.94s)]
*  really bad in my knee like super bad where I'm not a crazy anxious person dude but I [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2339.14s)]
*  finally got to like experience what it was like to have a panic attack because I was [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2347.02s)]
*  in Virginia training got it I was like something's up with my knee it hurt really bad. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2352.24s)]
*  Couldn't put weight on my leg. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2357.0s)]
*  This was probably like a month before the fight maybe maybe a little bit before that [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2359.3199999999997s)]
*  five weeks or so. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2362.7599999999998s)]
*  I got a really bad knee infection. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2364.3199999999997s)]
*  I started taking the antibiotics but they told me like hey man if this doesn't get better [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2367.24s)]
*  like if you start taking these antibiotics and tomorrow it's not better we need you to [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2372.08s)]
*  cut it come in we're gonna cut your knee open and clean it because that's how they take [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2375.08s)]
*  care of it. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2378.3199999999997s)]
*  I was like sure I was like I'm not coming back here you know like I'm gonna take these [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2380.8599999999997s)]
*  antibiotics because otherwise you can't fight and then I can't fight so yeah so that was [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2385.4199999999996s)]
*  a shitty situation but just pretty much really bad maybe three times three times yeah three [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2390.1s)]
*  times maybe like pretty bad yeah it's such a scary thing because it fucking kills people [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2398.58s)]
*  yeah it does staff gets get systemic gets in your bloodstream and you can die dude that's [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2403.18s)]
*  why I think I freaked out really bad with my knee is because I remember laying in bed [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2409.24s)]
*  and being like I called my wife and just set the phone next I was like hey like until you [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2413.56s)]

*  wasn't good but I remember every time I've taken antibiotics with the staph infection my [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2437.92s)]
*  experience has been that it gets really painful and a lot worse for like the first few hours when [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2442.36s)]
*  the antibiotics kick in and start killing it and then it starts to get better but the first couple [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2448.2400000000002s)]
*  of hours is like kind of scary so when I first started taking the antibiotics that's when I [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2453.38s)]
*  called my wife because I don't take a lot of medicine like if I take an ibuprofen I will feel [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2457.46s)]
*  that shit working through my entire body and yeah so I like took the antibiotics and I started to [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2462.06s)]

*  want to go to the dock and then get cut open and not be able to fight because that fight it already [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2480.46s)]
*  got canceled and shit so yeah I know we're always put in tough spots I know but sometimes you just [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2484.06s)]
*  got to do that sometimes you have to cancel a fight and I know nobody likes to hear that but I [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2490.62s)]
*  know it's so different than boxing boxing you get so few fight cancellations you know it's much less [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2496.02s)]
*  but when you're at wrestling when you're grappling you're constantly getting kicked and punched and [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2502.54s)]
*  you're fucking you're doing so many different things the odds of you getting injured are so [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2508.58s)]
*  much higher I know Gordon got staff for a fucking year like that's why his stomach is all fucked up [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2512.7799999999997s)]
*  Gordon Ryan was on antibiotics for a year and his internal gut bacteria his flora is just torched [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2520.46s)]
*  him he's just a mess damn can't keep food down his this like constant fight-or-flight reaction in [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2527.94s)]
*  his body where he wants to vomit all the time and he's going through training camps and beating [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2534.38s)]
*  everybody in grappling matches against the best in the world that's how good he is yeah like with [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2538.66s)]
*  staff for 12 years or excuse me 12 months and then on top of that this lingering stomach thing [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2543.62s)]
*  because of that that no doctor seems to figure out they can't fix it he's gone to like every fight [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2550.5s)]
*  they've given a bunch of different shit he's tried peptides and this and that and you get a little [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=2555.66s)]

*  second I started doing that I stopped cramping up I still get one every once in a while it's not [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3222.44s)]
*  like a hundred percent thing but it works yeah yeah muscle cramps must be brutal when you're [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3226.12s)]
*  weight right because you're draining your body of basically everything yeah yeah I don't my [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3231.6000000000004s)]
*  weight cuts I'm pretty like I kind of got down to a science a little bit I don't really cramp [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3237.0s)]
*  super bad how much do you cut like a week before I try to be like 16 to 18 pounds heavy over and [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3240.92s)]
*  then I'll lose that last bit that week but I'll walk around if I'm really fat like on vacation and [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3248.2400000000002s)]
*  shit not giving it just not caring I'll be about 162 when I'm training good and like all of that [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3253.84s)]
*  I'll be about 157 158 and then I just got to lose until I'm about 52 51 the week before and then [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3261.28s)]
*  the week is a calorie restriction in the beginning and then water restriction or how do you do it [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3268.1600000000003s)]
*  mmm it's a decent so ten days away I start loading up on water like the rule of thumb is however [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3274.08s)]
*  many pounds you got to lose that's how many pounds of water you'll drink that day so if I have [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3279.7200000000003s)]
*  16 to lose I'd have to drink two gallons of water also don't take any of my advice if you're [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3283.52s)]
*  listening to because I don't really fucking know I know that like water shit can get really scary [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3288.52s)]
*  so I don't you know like people chugging distilled water have like killed themselves and yeah distilled [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3292.24s)]
*  water is that what you drink no no no no no yeah but yeah ten days away I start loading up on the [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3296.4s)]
*  water and then on the Tuesday so we weigh in Friday so however many days before that is on [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3303.12s)]
*  Tuesday you'll do the cut the sodium and then that pretty much you lose a lot when you're chugging [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3308.24s)]
*  that much water and cut sodium so I would say on Tuesday a lot of it is water and then it's kind [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3314.9199999999996s)]
*  of up to me how crazy I want to go with food I'm obviously not eating like super huge meals that [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3320.8399999999997s)]
*  week but I don't let myself get too hungry I'm pretty good about a lot of stuff where now I can [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3325.9199999999996s)]
*  kind of be like if I go to bed like at like an eight amount of hunger instead of like a seven I'll [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3331.84s)]
*  know almost exactly how much I'll lose the next day which is like kind of cool how much of a [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3338.92s)]
*  performance hit do you think you have I mean obviously you're in phenomenal condition but [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3344.1600000000003s)]
*  how much of a hit do you think you have in dehydrating yourself 24 hours before a fight [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3348.1600000000003s)]
*  um yeah I think it depends on how much water you lose too I think just off the top of my head maybe [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3353.12s)]
*  15 or 20 15 or 20 percent maybe so what do you what would you think about if the UFC instituted [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3362.0s)]
*  more weight classes and they eliminated weight cuts like what if they said like because it is [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3371.6s)]
*  for some guys it is the most dangerous part yeah the fight because some guys go hard yeah they [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3376.56s)]
*  losing 26 30 pounds within a couple of days and they just look like hell yeah I think that the way [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3381.88s)]
*  to solve that because one's tried doing that with like the rehydration tests and everyone that I [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3389.12s)]
*  talked to that's like been involved with that has been like dude I could cheat that easy oh really [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3393.88s)]
*  yeah but how do they cheat it I mean there's just like if you know that you're gonna get like hydrate [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3398.0s)]
*  tested at a certain time I'm sure that they probably just drink most of their water during [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3405.44s)]
*  that time or something like that but then your weight would be higher right yeah your weight would [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3409.52s)]
*  have to be higher but I don't know that they like test you yeah yeah I guess I don't really know [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3414.84s)]
*  honestly but I mean if they're gonna test you when you do they test you like hey your weight has to [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3421.44s)]
*  be this and then you're high I think that they just go in and they're like hey how yellow is your [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3428.44s)]
*  piss type of thing you know I'm pretty sure that that's what it might be if it's like more [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3432.32s)]
*  scientific than cool but it might just be like hey it's gotta be more scientific because sometimes [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3436.52s)]
*  my piss is pretty yellow it just meant I drank a lot of vitamins yeah you know I think it's a [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3443.08s)]
*  there's like an actual test where they test yeah the levels I think that if you added in more weight [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3449.7599999999998s)]
*  classes that would handle a lot of it I probably just do 140 would you if that would that be ideal [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3456.84s)]
*  for you that'd be pretty ideal yeah yeah I feel like the UFC should have more weight classes and [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3462.44s)]
*  I've said this for a long time I think this there's some gaps they're crazy like the 85 205 yeah that's [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3466.52s)]
*  nuts 20 pounds is nuts that's crazy that's not that's three weight classes at least in between [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3474.2000000000003s)]
*  fights like that's in between classes rather that's nuts I just don't understand that yeah if you I [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3480.04s)]
*  mean I think that the way that old sports kind of do things they do things for a reason so like [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3485.44s)]
*  boxing and wrestling they all have like it's every seven pounds or whatever it is the UFC is like [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3490.36s)]
*  oh too many champions that way it's too confusing I'm like what are you talking about it's one UFC [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3495.8s)]
*  champion per weight class yeah you'd have more champions and then you could also have more [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3501.08s)]
*  champion versus champion fights yeah for sure it wouldn't be like Ilya going up ten pounds is not [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3505.1600000000003s)]
*  too crazy but Alex when he went from 85 to 205 that was pretty crazy yeah that's a big-ass jump [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3510.4s)]
*  yeah obviously he could do it because he's one of the craziest weight cutters of all time he was [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3516.7599999999998s)]
*  fighting 85 and weighing in at 226 the day of what really oh yeah when he fought out of Sanya he was [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3521.6s)]
*  226 when he got into the cage is that 41 pounds or 31 pounds and 41 pounds so after 36 hours he put [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3528.48s)]
*  on that 41 pounds yeah holy shit holy shit that's crazy he's also giant he's an enormous guy it's [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3536.12s)]
*  like a lot of body mass yeah and apparently it's easier to cut weight like yoel romero style like [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3542.64s)]
*  when you're that muscular because most of the muscles water which is kind of counterintuitive [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3548.44s)]
*  if you think like a fat guy would you could be able to lose more weight but no it's actually to [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3552.92s)]
*  dry out the big muscular guys can lose more weight yeah definitely yeah I have a theory too like the [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3557.52s)]
*  more ripped you are the easier it is to sweat too because if your muscle is like muscle then fat [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3562.48s)]
*  then skin and you gotta like it's got to travel through the fat this is how I fucking think [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3567.72s)]
*  there's no evidence of any of that because there are some fatso's that sweat but I don't know [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3572.56s)]
*  sometimes I'm like I can just see who's gonna be a good sweater and who's not but that's probably [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3580.0s)]
*  me just being yeah I don't know if there's any science to that makes sense in your head kind of [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3585.16s)]
*  makes sense in your head I kind of see what you're saying I kind of see what you're saying but you [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3591.08s)]
*  could also I guess make argument that fat makes you warmer too maybe that sweats it out too yeah but [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3595.12s)]
*  I don't think that there would be a problem with doing multiple weight classes because then you [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3601.24s)]
*  would just have like what you do in boxing where you just have like a ton of you have like one dude [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3604.3599999999997s)]
*  with like eight belts right that would be cool like look at Pacquiao yeah he just keeps going up in [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3608.48s)]
*  weight classes and yeah I think that it just be better for the athletes and I think it'd be better [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3613.2799999999997s)]
*  for the sport in general you're still gonna have like incredible fights because the level of [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3618.72s)]
*  competition particularly at the lowest weight classes is so high right now like I think your [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3623.8s)]
*  weight class featherweight and lightweight the most competitive weight classes in the sport and [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3629.2000000000003s)]
*  there's almost too many top contenders where guys are forced to take fights that maybe you really [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3634.6400000000003s)]
*  shouldn't take that fight because you're kind of entitled contention and then oh you lose a [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3640.76s)]
*  close decision fuck now you're back to the drawing board now you got to fight this guy oh you got [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3645.1200000000003s)]
*  injured in camp fuck you lose to that guy too now you're set back when you could have been a [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3648.92s)]
*  champion yeah you know it's there's a lot of like weirdness going on with possibilities and you [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3653.12s)]
*  know just luck bad luck and good luck bad luck and good luck timing I think is a thing like I [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3659.32s)]
*  think that I'm pretty I was even saying this before the figurative fight I was like watch like if I go [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3665.7200000000003s)]
*  out and finish figgy which not a lot of people are able to do the timing of everything is gonna [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3671.44s)]
*  be perfect for me because there will be no one else and that's and that's me also you know coming [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3676.8s)]
*  off of a loss from umar just a year ago which anytime you lose kind of devastating you're like [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3681.64s)]
*  oh it'll never happen for me you know but then it's like oh wait no if I just if this thing gets [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3686.08s)]
*  timed out right you know like it could work out so a lot of it was a competitive so yeah I know [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3691.54s)]
*  I fuck super what did you think went wrong more than anything okay it was it was like a it's never [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3698.3599999999997s)]
*  just one thing it's always like things get compiled and then they exponentially get worse one big [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3705.92s)]
*  thing was I knew I was fighting in the Middle East and I wasn't gonna get like a nod if it was [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3710.48s)]
*  a close fight and umar is a defensive guy and I'm a defensive guy and I knew that it would be there [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3715.32s)]
*  was potential for rounds to be really close my game plan wasn't gonna be to take him down so anytime [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3721.48s)]
*  you're gonna be like hey like I'm committing to striking there is a little bit of a level of [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3727.76s)]
*  rolling the dice because one striking matches in a five-minute round are really hard to like hammer [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3732.8s)]
*  down and be like I won this round against really high-level guys that's my opinion I thought that [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3739.56s)]
*  I would be able to stuff most of the shots I was like okay most of this thing is gonna be done [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3746.36s)]
*  striking I need to have like big moments in order for me to feel like I'm really winning these rounds [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3750.64s)]
*  so that there can be no argument that I'm losing and if we just are point scoring each other which [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3756.52s)]
*  umar is good at and I'm good at I'm kind of rolling the dice a little bit and kind of leaving it into [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3760.7599999999998s)]
*  the hands of who God knows who the judges are you know so a piece of it was I didn't want to lose [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3765.6s)]
*  another close split decision like a lot of my losses or a couple of my losses are just close [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3770.44s)]
*  split decisions and I'm like fucking man I'm not I'd rather just go for it than lose you know but [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3774.96s)]
*  that pulled me out of my game plan and just the way that I typically fight like I'm not the guy [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3780.0s)]
*  that hunts for knockouts you know I'm just not that guy and so I just got pulled out of my strategy [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3786.24s)]
*  I got really frustrated in the fight by it not working like me not being able to have really big [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3792.0s)]
*  moments and now looking back I'm just like man what were you thinking like just go out fight like [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3797.92s)]
*  how you do and you'll do awesome what do you think specifically like you would have done different [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3803.2s)]
*  exchanges I would have fought him the exact same way that I would have fought the first like that [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3808.04s)]
*  entire fight I was being really defensive and just looking for one big shot in the first round I [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3812.68s)]
*  didn't fight like that the first round I was cool with point scoring I was like okay this guy's [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3819.64s)]
*  gonna wrestle me let's see how good he is at wrestling and if I can hang once I was like oh [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3823.68s)]
*  okay cool like I can hang then I just started going for big shots which is just like not a good way [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3827.72s)]
*  to beat a really high level guy it's kind of a lazy game plan honestly like if the plan isn't [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3833.2s)]
*  to completely outclass the person and win in every area and be good enough to do so in my opinion [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3839.24s)]
*  that's just like not an expression of the highest level of martial arts that's a little bit lazy [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3846.24s)]
*  you know and I was I was a little bit lazy and maybe my approach to that which maybe lazy isn't [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3850.3999999999996s)]
*  the right word but I could have done a lot better I just trusted myself more being more confident in [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3856.52s)]
*  my ability to just be like no like I'll beat him everywhere you know looking for the big shots [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3862.7599999999998s)]
*  is always such a trap until it's not until it's not and you look real cool oh my goodness we all [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3867.8799999999997s)]
*  like looking cool yeah you land the big ones and you've landed a lot of the big ones yeah you've [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3874.2s)]
*  had so many of those moments like the Frankie Edgar fight or you know there's been quite the [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3878.48s)]
*  Marlon Marais fight that was a wild one that was a great one that was probably like my happiest [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3882.92s)]
*  moment maybe ever in life just because I had just come off the most embarrassing loss ever against [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3887.3999999999996s)]
*  Sterling and they were like hey you want to fight the number one guy in Abu Dhabi during COVID and [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3892.96s)]
*  I was like and that was like kind of back when Marlon was still a really scary guy he's kind of [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3897.3199999999997s)]
*  been on a skid since then but back then he was real scary and I was like I don't know if you guys [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3902.16s)]
*  are setting me up for Marlon knock me the fuck out or how this is like what the thinking behind [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3906.8799999999997s)]
*  me fighting the number one contender is but I was like yeah cool like if you guys are gonna [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3911.8799999999997s)]
*  give me that shot I'll take it for sure and then when I finished it I was just like yes and you [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3915.24s)]
*  finished him with a wheel kick yeah which I during COVID was practicing in my basement with my wife [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3919.72s)]
*  like every day isn't that stupid I was like why did I was like man you should have asked me for a cut [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3925.48s)]
*  no because it's a thing where you know if you you don't expect it from a guy who doesn't really [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3931.04s)]
*  throw a lot yeah you know and so like you see his foot turn you're like what's going on here and [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3937.2s)]
*  before you know it it's too late yeah and that heel is headed towards your dome yeah people that [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3941.84s)]
*  are good at those too it's a problem oh yeah like that doesn't need to land anywhere specific for [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3946.8s)]
*  to like rattle your brain enough to knock you down oh it's a terrifying yeah yeah it is so much [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3953.6s)]
*  power yeah if there was one thing I would not want to get hit with it would be that my during [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3957.72s)]
*  my taekwondo days I used to feel like I was always gonna be fine like I'd be I was like I felt like [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3963.12s)]
*  you know I was young I was 19 I felt invulnerable and I was really good and I fought in the nationals [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3971.2799999999997s)]
*  in California and I hit this kid with a wheel kick and he never got up and he was snoring like [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3977.68s)]
*  out faceplant out cold taking off in a stretcher taking to the hospital and I never felt the same [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3984.7999999999997s)]
*  about fighting again because I was always scared that that could happen to me then because I was [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3990.52s)]
*  like doing this for nothing there's no money I was doing this for nothing I had no health insurance [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3994.24s)]
*  I was poor yeah and I was like what am I doing yeah like this is like I could have easily got [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=3998.44s)]
*  hit by that same kick but I was better than him and I landed but there's guys that are better [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4004.68s)]
*  than me and if they hit me like that face down snow I mean it was my heel hurt for days I was [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4008.96s)]
*  limping the next day my knee hurt after the Frankie fight yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but I kind of felt [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4015.52s)]
*  a similar way where I don't know I guess you kind of just get used to that where you're just like [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4023.52s)]
*  but you're a professional yeah that's your sport that's your your living this is what you do for me [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4027.3999999999996s)]
*  I was a young kid doing this thing that I was really good at and it just gave me like some sense [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4033.56s)]
*  of purpose and then I was like what the fuck so how like so you didn't have like big aspiring dreams [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4039.08s)]
*  to be like a taekwondo champ or anything I had dreams to be an Olympic the Olympic to go to the [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4046.08s)]
*  Olympics but was that like a realistic dream yes yeah yeah yeah I was that good yeah I was a good [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4052.2799999999997s)]
*  I had won national tournaments and I had beaten guys that had been in like high ranking and I [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4057.8s)]
*  had a very close decision I thought I should have won the year that the taekwondo made it into the [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4064.28s)]
*  Olympics against the national champion cool so I was good and I was really young so I was getting [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4069.88s)]
*  better all the time yeah but then I started kickboxing and when I started training in [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4074.1200000000003s)]
*  kickboxing I realized that taekwondo is kind of bullshit because my hands sucked and I would [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4079.1200000000003s)]
*  spar with kickboxers and I was getting you know cornered in the ropes and I just I didn't have [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4084.4s)]
*  the skills and I was like oh this is like I have this distorted perception of my ability to fight [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4088.56s)]
*  based on my ability to fight in taekwondo sure I was really good at that but then when I started [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4093.76s)]
*  boxing and kickboxing I was like this like that piece that's missing in taekwondo without the [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4098.32s)]
*  face punching it nullifies so much of what taekwondo is good at yeah but then when I learned [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4104.2s)]
*  that stuff I realized like oh but I have a massive advantage with my legs because they have to close [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4110.44s)]
*  the distance with me and I can do things they can't do like regular kickboxers I was amazed at how [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4116.4s)]
*  many of them were just kind of boxers who learned a few shitty kicks and they would stand on the [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4121.36s)]
*  outside and they would take a step forward and I just blast them and they just had no idea what [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4126.44s)]
*  to do like a really hard kicker and then I started doing Muay Thai and I was like fuck leg kicks and [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4131.2s)]
*  so I went from American kickboxing above the waist to Muay Thai I was like there's too much [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4138.24s)]
*  to learn yeah and then I was doing comedy at the same time so I just quit fighting yeah I gotta [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4142.88s)]
*  get out before I get hurt when you start grappling when I was 30 cool yeah I started grappling right [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4147.48s)]
*  at I guess I was 29 it was right after the first UFC did you like wrestle at all or anything yeah [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4153.72s)]
*  I wrestled in high school but only one year because I was doing taekwondo at the same time and I had [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4159.4s)]
*  to pick one and I did it a year of both and then I was like the problem with this is like I rather [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4164.24s)]
*  kick someone and knock them unconscious like that's it was so that to just whack and hear the whole [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4171.08s)]
*  crowd go silent it was the wildest thing yeah and watch someone cry I fucking loved it was my favorite [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4176.639999999999s)]
*  thing in life and I was like wrestling is cool like it's good to know it's good to be able to pin [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4182.5599999999995s)]
*  people but there was no UFC back then so it's like everything you were doing was just like you had [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4187.12s)]
*  to find a thing and get really good at it but the disillusionment of going from taekwondo to boxing [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4193.28s)]
*  and kickboxing and then to Muay Thai and then jiu-jitsu so when I started doing jiu-jitsu I was [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4199.16s)]
*  like oh my god I'm fucking completely helpless so I had this thing in my head well at least I know [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4204.08s)]
*  I know how to leg kick I know how to box now I know how to fight oh my god I'm tapping out constantly [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4208.32s)]
*  yeah and so that was like fuck I gotta learn how to do jiu-jitsu yeah but it was this thing where [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4214.48s)]
*  I feel real fortunate to have grown up in a time where no one knew what was the best style and then [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4219.88s)]
*  see the UFC emerge in 93 and then watch this incredible transformation of martial arts where [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4226.6s)]
*  martial arts advances more in 10-20 years than it had the last 30,000 years it was incredible to [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4233.0s)]
*  watch yeah yeah I'm glad that they did it man because that's such a cool question is whose [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4240.28s)]
*  martial arts is the best martial arts no one knew man yeah all and we were all delusional I was so [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4245.56s)]
*  delusional like I remember I used to do taekwondo with a friend of mine we were kickboxing at the [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4251.240000000001s)]
*  time and we were doing at this gym where these judo guys were and I was like look at these idiots [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4256.76s)]
*  this stupid judo that's useless yeah meanwhile I had no idea if those guys got a hold of me I was [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4260.6s)]
*  fucking helpless yeah because judo guys will slam you on your head oh yeah dude rolling with judo [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4265.400000000001s)]
*  guys like I remember I rolled with Cairo Parisi once I was like he's like a chimpanzee yeah he was [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4270.200000000001s)]
*  so strong like it didn't make any sense like we were roughly the same size and he was just [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4275.0s)]
*  ragdolling me around I was like there's something to throwing bodies all the time you know you're [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4280.92s)]
*  taking if you're 180 pound guy you're throwing 180 pound person over and over and over again [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4287.48s)]
*  and your whole core is just fucking primed for that boom yeah and their balance and their ability [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4292.44s)]
*  to adjust your weight and use it against you watching it in the Olympics is awesome because [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4298.6s)]
*  they'll like spear their own heads oh yeah that's crazy that is crazy I like watching that shit [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4303.5599999999995s)]
*  that's like I'm like oh my god next to yeah oh you'd have to do like the way that they land on [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4308.36s)]
*  yeah there's so many of those guys like you see them later in their career they got like one small [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4314.12s)]
*  arm because their fucking nerves are all shut off and fused discs and they're just like I did a good [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4318.5199999999995s)]
*  job a fucking great career you can't even walk man it's nuts every taekwondo guy I know has like [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4325.08s)]
*  one super strong oblique and they're like shaped like this and well you gotta learn how to kick [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4330.76s)]
*  from both sides that's so important that's one thing that I really admire about your style [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4336.04s)]
*  because I think that there's there's gonna be a time where that is just ubiquitous where everybody [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4341.16s)]
*  switches because there's so many guys that are just like oh he's a southpaw oh he fights orthodox [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4346.04s)]
*  like man that's just leaving too much to predictability yeah I think about striking like a dance dance [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4351.320000000001s)]
*  revolution game where like because you're making all the reads with your eyes it's like left arms [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4357.8s)]
*  coming at me move like right leg whatever it's not like grappling we're grappling we get to [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4363.64s)]
*  interact with each other and feel each other and move each other that way and I can pretty much [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4369.24s)]
*  sometimes do with my eyes closed right striking is done mostly with our eyes so we have to do like [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4373.8s)]
*  these dance dance revolution and like okay react to everything that we're seeing so if I'm just [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4379.400000000001s)]
*  switching my stance and now you have to like read the sentence backwards exactly it gets really hard [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4384.12s)]
*  you know and um especially if you're just as good with both sides yes yes and I would say that if [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4390.2s)]
*  you're starting you don't need to be like super stellar at both but just have a couple good attacks [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4396.2s)]
*  to do from your other stance and then just like build off of there whatever I got I started [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4400.2s)]
*  switching stances one because I really liked watching Nenito Daener who wouldn't like fully [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4405.0s)]
*  switch but he would have like kind of steps like that that where I was like oh cool and then also [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4410.84s)]
*  I dislocated my elbow really bad about like a week and a half into training just landed on it posted [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4415.64s)]
*  dislocated it and so I could only or that was my left arm so I could only use my right arm [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4420.68s)]
*  so for like six months I just went lefty and only used my right arm um as like my lead hand and that's [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4426.4400000000005s)]
*  how I got really good at it yeah just forcing yourself to just constantly be in that position [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4432.68s)]
*  because everybody wants to be in the position where they're the most strong especially if you're [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4438.04s)]
*  trying to be competitive and sparring right that's like it's what's so important about like the [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4441.16s)]
*  Gracie's always talk about keeping things playful like learning how to like not don't try to win [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4445.32s)]
*  you're trying to develop your skills and to be able to switch I think like TJ in his prime like [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4450.36s)]
*  when TJ fought Henen Berao that fight to me was one of the best championship performances that I [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4456.36s)]
*  ever saw I agree because nobody thought TJ was going to win that fight Henen Berao was thought [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4462.2s)]
*  to be the number one pound for it was him and Aldo yeah would people make the argument of who's [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4466.44s)]
*  the best Henen Berao was I think he was undefeated or maybe had one he was early his career he was [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4470.599999999999s)]
*  an animal at the time animal animal animal and TJ pieced him up and it was like he was sparring he [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4475.32s)]
*  looked so in the zone and relaxed and he was constantly switching stances and footwork and [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4481.96s)]
*  angles yeah they uh Dwayne flew me out for that fight because that's when they were training an [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4487.5599999999995s)]
*  alpha male to be TJ's sparring partner for one of those fights I'm almost positive it was that one [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4491.72s)]
*  and I remember the whole time I was like this isn't gonna go good for TJ you know because Berao was [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4496.92s)]
*  just that guy at the time that everyone was afraid of and then when I watched it I was like oh shit [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4502.12s)]
*  that shit really works good I uh I used to train in the Netherlands a little bit too with Andy [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4507.240000000001s)]
*  Sauer and those guys oh really yeah so that was really cool but there's it's like traditional like [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4512.12s)]
*  you stand in one stance like this is how we do shit here you know yeah and I was like switching [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4516.280000000001s)]
*  stances I was probably like the the gay guy at the gym a little bit you know like being kind of [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4520.44s)]
*  flamboyant and like show-offy and uh so so I remember going with some of Sauer's good guys [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4526.04s)]
*  and just good guys that we would spar with and I wouldn't really get hit that much and I was like [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4533.879999999999s)]
*  oh shit this like actually works like this isn't just some like foo-foo whatever stuff you know [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4539.16s)]
*  it's crazy that Dwayne developed that style but he didn't fight that way yeah that's what's crazy [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4544.2s)]
*  like Dwayne had like more of a traditional he always boss-routin inspired style and then he [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4549.5599999999995s)]
*  realizes like you know the best way to fight is actually to constantly be changed and then he [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4556.04s)]
*  develops this system and you know Dwayne's like super focused I know you know this but yeah for [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4560.68s)]
*  people who don't know Dwayne has like a notebook like fucking which is filled with notes and it's [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4565.8s)]
*  all like he's got systems this is his life yeah it's not like what Adesanya likes to call button [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4570.68s)]
*  smashing when you're playing a game like no it's very systematic and TJ I think in that [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4575.64s)]
*  Henenborough fight was the greatest expression of what Dwayne teaches yep yep yeah that was a super [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4581.0s)]
*  amazing fight um yeah just switching I mean just simple little stuff you know like um it's a lot [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4586.52s)]
*  of striking is just like how coordinated you are like that's like a big piece of striking and then [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4593.160000000001s)]
*  can I just overwhelm you with information like that's like a strategy to run you know some [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4599.4800000000005s)]
*  people choose like okay I'm willing to take a few to like land my big one you know that's like an [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4604.36s)]
*  okay strategy it works for guys like Ilya and stuff um but Ilya is not that easy to hit that that's [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4610.12s)]
*  true too he has like a way way good guard he rolls with stuff like the josh mitt fight yeah you know [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4615.4s)]
*  he like takes he like slides away from stuff and these big bombs are coming his way he's doing like [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4620.839999999999s)]
*  the highest form like intellectually he's doing that style at its highest expression with the [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4626.36s)]
*  strategy of I'm about to knock you the fuck out yeah which shouldn't be everyone's strategy [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4632.44s)]
*  you know you have to have that that touch of death yeah that's true and he's got that [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4636.44s)]
*  god-given power his power is fucking crazy it is crazy Trevor's actually helped me understand why [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4641.0s)]
*  it works really good um so okay so uh not to get crazy technical with it I guess okay get in there [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4646.839999999999s)]
*  all right cool um so squared and bladed stances when you're in a squared stance you can move [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4654.44s)]
*  really good left to right that was most of my career was being like I'm I came from a basketball [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4661.56s)]
*  background I know that I'm very quick and agile and I can move left right really good um if I just [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4667.320000000001s)]
*  keep my hands up whatever it'll be fine probably you know so a lot of squared stand stuff is I'm [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4672.68s)]
*  just going to cut left right overwhelm this person with all of my weapons and angles and always [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4678.6s)]
*  constantly make them move off of the things I'm doing and not the other way around that's good [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4682.92s)]
*  but it's really hard to uh like get a ton of leverage in anything that you're doing when [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4689.0s)]
*  you're standing square like I can't like if I'm going to throw a ball I don't throw a ball like [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4695.72s)]
*  this right I throw a ball like this right you have your shoulder behind the other shoulder yeah um so [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4699.96s)]
*  squared stance is super good for being agile moving left right and overwhelming people with [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4705.16s)]
*  the amount of attacks that you could throw at them because also if I'm standing square all of my [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4709.8s)]
*  weapons are really available for me to throw like it doesn't take like this is faster than this [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4714.04s)]
*  just because it's like six inches closer or whatever in a bladed stance you get a fuck [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4720.2s)]
*  load of leverage because if you watch Ilya he's always standing like he's about to throw a javelin [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4725.8s)]
*  and that's pretty much what he's doing is just like and this is kind of like the science of [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4731.56s)]
*  boxing a little bit like I said that Trevor helped me with so I'm a lot more bladed now than I was [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4736.04s)]
*  because now we're trying to get like some serious leverage on stuff because five round fights moving [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4740.52s)]
*  the entire time fighting these really good wrestlers it can get to the point where it's like [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4745.72s)]
*  it just gets quirky and just like a little bitchy looking you know and like I don't really want to [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4750.6s)]
*  like tap people to victory you know right um for a long time I would compensate in being like all [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4755.160000000001s)]
*  right but I'll but I'll have wheel kicks knees and elbows and that like took me a decent amount of [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4760.52s)]
*  ways too where it's like cool now I can finish guys like that also but these bladed stances [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4766.04s)]
*  where you can make a shitload of leverage with them are really cool I think finding a balance [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4770.84s)]
*  between the two is really awesome Ilya is like only and that's just my expression of my martial [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4776.6s)]
*  arts I want to be like the jack of all trades guys and be able to be like oh you're that style [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4781.56s)]
*  I'll just archetype you in this style but Ilya is like always ready to throw javelin and he's [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4786.12s)]
*  really good at closing space with his lead leg like he'll like jab hook and really creep his [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4792.36s)]
*  lead leg near and then just bomb a right hand because he is a shorter guy but he never seems [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4798.28s)]
*  like he's having that much of an issue getting super inside well it's going to be interesting [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4803.24s)]
*  seeing him at 55 that will be interesting much bigger guys like think about Mauricio Ruffi yeah [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4808.36s)]
*  that's 55 and he moves good and has leverage and he's fucking gigantic yeah how tall is Ruffi I [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4814.44s)]
*  mean he's got to be 6'1 maybe 6'2 and he's 55 and he's not thin yeah I mean he's lean but he's not [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4821.64s)]
*  like scrawny he's got muscle he's fucking huge for 55 yeah some 55 and Ilya as powerful as he is he's [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4828.360000000001s)]
*  not that big it's going to be interesting to see because because of this 10 pound 10 pounds is just [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4836.68s)]
*  like it's a lot of weight man you know it's like when you're dealing with a hundred and fifty five [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4842.52s)]
*  pound person it's a significant percentage of your body weight especially when everyone's cutting like [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4847.400000000001s)]
*  30 pounds I don't know what Ruffi cuts but when I see him walking around he looks like he's 190 [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4851.4s)]
*  pounds yeah yeah you know like Islam Islam's fucking huge yeah he's big dude when I interview [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4855.879999999999s)]
*  him in the cage afterwards I'm always like how really how are you 155 yeah how I know how he's [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4862.36s)]
*  thick as fuck he's got a giant back yeah and when he gets a hold of guys it's like he's just got this [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4869.32s)]
*  this grappling squeeze that it's I remember when he fought Drew Dober and like when he got Dober down [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4876.84s)]
*  to the ground I was like that's a wrap yeah it's a wrap as soon as he gets on top and then he starts [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4883.32s)]
*  clamping down squeezing and guys are just like Olivera was tapping like the moment it was on [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4887.72s)]
*  yeah fuck this yeah a lot of those really good grappler guys they're strong definitely but they're [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4893.0s)]
*  really strong at closing up all of the space like I can if you let me get an underhook like I can feel [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4898.12s)]
*  pretty strong like even if you're much bigger than me I'll like make you take a couple steps back [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4904.36s)]
*  which really shouldn't happen but if I just close up all of the space which I think is a big component [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4908.04s)]
*  of being a really good grappler is being able to be like nope that's my space you don't get that [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4913.719999999999s)]
*  this you know and you're not going to get inside of mine I can feel strong as fuck you know um and [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4918.28s)]
*  yeah those types of guys they're just so used to being so compact and never letting anyone get [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4924.759999999999s)]
*  inside their arms or wherever it is that they need to get that it's just it's like impossible [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4929.4s)]
*  to feel like you can move them I feel like there's two types of being strong in grappling there's [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4934.92s)]
*  being strong in like I don't let you move me and then they're strong in I get to move you really [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4940.04s)]
*  good and the good good guys get to do both like if I can grab you and move you really easy I'll [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4945.879999999999s)]
*  feel really strong if you grab me and I feel like a rock I'm I'll feel really strong um and I think [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4951.16s)]
*  that some people do both of those really well and then some people do one or the other really well [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4957.72s)]
*  but those types of guys like the islams they do both really good yeah and he's also his striking [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4962.92s)]
*  has leveled up significantly I guess striking is much much better than it was when he was younger [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4969.08s)]
*  was he's just he's a threat everywhere like when he knocked out volk with that high kick yeah [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4973.8s)]
*  that was crazy crazy but granted if I was in volk's corner I would say no you're not taking it you've [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4978.68s)]
*  been drinking beer and eating kebabs like there's no way you're taking this fight on 10 days notice [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4985.32s)]
*  I don't care how confident you are I don't care how much you like fighting that's a crazy thing [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4990.92s)]
*  I don't care how much money they're paying you because you look at the slide that his career took [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4995.32s)]
*  right he arguably won that first fight with Islam very close fight loses the decision or was it a [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=4999.48s)]
*  draw uh it was a decision shit was it a draw that's actually a good question I think he lost I think [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5005.799999999999s)]
*  he lost too yeah either way Islam keeps the title was it a draw why don't I think it was a draw [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5012.76s)]
*  maybe one judge had it a draw maybe it was something like that um so super close fight [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5017.64s)]
*  with the pound for pound best fighter in the world 10 pounds up everybody's like [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5022.76s)]
*  volk might be the best pound for pound fighter in the world and then he takes that fight on 10 [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5026.12s)]
*  days notice gets head kicked and then he comes into the fight with teporia what four months later [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5029.5599999999995s)]
*  or something like that compromised clearly you got head kicked shin to the dome stopped [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5034.76s)]
*  unconscious and then you've got to fight the scariest fucking boxer in the division and you [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5041.24s)]
*  get knocked out you know and so then this big slide and then he comes back full year off and [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5045.48s)]
*  you see against Diego Lopez looks like the Volk of old looks like he's back well I would like to [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5051.32s)]
*  see that volk versus Ilya yeah that would have been an exciting fight yeah someone's decision [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5057.0s)]
*  second one was uh yeah ko okay so it was a decision yeah yeah I feel like the casuals like to exist [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5062.36s)]
*  in a world where oh no if you're if you're a better fighter then you're just a better fighter [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5071.0s)]
*  but it's like no man like if I have three months to train versus two weeks to train like big [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5075.88s)]
*  difference that's giant difference giant like giant difference I don't do zins this isn't a zen [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5081.48s)]
*  what is it I just don't want it's like uh I just started taking them they're called they're like [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5085.88s)]
*  they have 50 milligrams of caffeine in them they're called nz ease oh yeah I've taken those those are [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5089.64s)]
*  good yeah they're super good I like those um they're uh brain stimulants yeah yeah uh I got [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5095.0s)]
*  a one that I got that I bought called alpha that's pretty good although I did kind of get a little [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5100.04s)]
*  annoyed that they ripped off alpha brain it's you know I like these these are great too these [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5105.16s)]
*  gummies these alpha brain gummies are fucking awesome um yeah I don't do caffeine anymore [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5110.2s)]
*  that's really one thing that I stopped well I do like this amount of caffeine I do like 50 milligrams [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5115.32s)]
*  just 50 okay second tea small cup of coffee yeah you know what's crazy is uh so um I didn't drink [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5120.12s)]
*  like a lot of caffeine or whatever I would drink like a coffee in the morning like normal people [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5126.68s)]
*  but dude what I learned is because once I stopped I immediately had way way more energy or maybe not [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5131.0s)]
*  immediately but like 10 days two weeks afterwards and you know what I looked up bro is that I already [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5137.400000000001s)]
*  have like low iron but I noticed or I looked up coffee gets in the way of iron absorption [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5142.92s)]
*  really I yeah you have low iron do you eat red meat uh yeah I eat a lot it's like a genetic thing [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5151.32s)]
*  my mom has super low I think it's like a ginger thing I got like a fucking yeah we're just born [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5157.16s)]
*  caffeine can inhibit iron absorption primarily due to the presence of tannins and other polyphenols [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5162.6s)]
*  dude I swear this has changed me big so now I do the mud water stuff where I drink all the mud water [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5168.6s)]
*  I like matcha still so I'll still do like 50 milligrams in the morning but dude the coffee [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5174.44s)]
*  I stopped and I immediately started feeling way better and I don't know how many people don't know [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5179.4s)]
*  this but this is a thing bro I'm a coffee junkie I know I have a real problem it tastes good I still [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5183.4800000000005s)]
*  drink decaf sometimes because I really like the taste of it I take days off of these things like [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5189.88s)]
*  this is a breakers lucies these are nicotine I like them when I do podcasts I like them before [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5194.679999999999s)]
*  I do stand up but I take days off because I was like am I addicted to these things I'm fucking [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5200.28s)]
*  sucking on these things all day long but I took a couple days off like no I feel fine yeah I feel [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5204.76s)]
*  fine but I've taken days off coffee and I'm like yeah yeah it takes like a week or so I'm falling [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5208.36s)]
*  asleep in the morning just like yeah I honestly don't think everyone would have the same experience [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5214.12s)]
*  I did I think it's because the iron thing that makes a lot of sense man yeah drinking coffee [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5218.92s)]
*  and other caffeinated beverages with a meal associated with 39 to 90 reduction in iron absorption [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5223.56s)]
*  dude it was great yeah and so I so this so bro this is how I found out it wasn't like I was [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5228.52s)]
*  seeking this it was I take an iron supplement in the morning usually because I have a little bit of [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5233.240000000001s)]
*  low iron and when I stopped drinking coffee one of the signs that you you are you're taking too much [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5239.240000000001s)]
*  iron is that you'll get like an iron metallic taste in your mouth and so about two weeks afterwards [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5245.240000000001s)]
*  or whenever I started tasting that taste in my mouth and I looked it up and that's what it was [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5250.92s)]
*  so I stopped taking the iron supplement because I was actually absorbing the iron from my food and [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5255.32s)]
*  shit wow isn't that crazy that is crazy fuck I might have to try it yeah it's it was it was kind [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5260.68s)]
*  of rough though oh yeah I bet yeah it was rough it was like um I quit everything at that time just [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5267.08s)]
*  because I was like getting like my body was getting anxious my mind is pretty much like stupid the [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5273.0s)]
*  whole time to life but my body will get really uh I'll just like notice different shit I'll just [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5277.5599999999995s)]
*  like be more tired or anxious or whatever you know well you're so in tune yeah a fighter is [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5283.5599999999995s)]
*  probably out of all the professional sports I think a fighter probably is the most in tune [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5289.0s)]
*  with her body probably because there's so like the consequences of not being in tune are so grave [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5294.2s)]
*  like this it's so different than any other sport definitely there's a lot of ways to get hurt and [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5300.44s)]
*  we have to watch what we actually eat most sports you don't really have to do that it's just right [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5304.84s)]
*  um like we're super like food the relationship with food for a fighter is way way different than [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5309.64s)]
*  I think almost everyone else on the planet I know when you like Adesanya never cared about his [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5314.84s)]
*  nutrition never took care of it until he got older yeah and then he got older he realized like hey [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5319.56s)]
*  I've got to really fucking do everything I know dude I used to I used to be able to just down a [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5324.52s)]
*  chipotle burrito with all the hot sauce on it and then just train afterwards like it was nothing [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5329.4800000000005s)]
*  now I can't do that which kind of sucks yeah that's also youth god to me when you're really [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5334.44s)]
*  young you can get away with anything you really can do I used to just be hungover rolling in and [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5339.8s)]
*  just fighting it was crazy it's crazy how much you can get away with when you're young yeah but it's [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5344.36s)]
*  like the other thing is like hard training for long prolonged periods years and years and years [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5350.04s)]
*  you get all these little micro injuries those little things things are slowing down you're just [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5357.16s)]
*  demanding so much of your body if you're not taking care of your nutrition it's like [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5362.04s)]
*  are you serious about this or not I know like what are you doing you're fucking six hours in [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5368.04s)]
*  the gym and then you're eating pizza that's crazy I see people fuck up their weight cuts all the [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5372.12s)]
*  time just because after they cut weight they want to eat like an asshole and I'm like what are you [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5376.5199999999995s)]
*  doing dude you literally did for eight weeks you were the most disciplined person in the world and [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5381.0s)]
*  now you're eating cake the night before the fight you're an idiot so dumb yeah so dumb I know take [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5384.92s)]
*  the night before a fight it's so crazy Ilja famous Lloyd he said he only did it twice but he was [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5389.64s)]
*  and they made it seem like in the countdown shows that he did it a lot he would drink wine [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5394.6s)]
*  yeah his weight cutting yeah the whole time I was watching that I was like he doesn't do that every [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5398.280000000001s)]
*  time he was like here I was like come on this like media stuff you know I was like you're not [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5402.12s)]
*  convincing me that he does that you know he did it twice he said yeah but I was like what am I [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5407.96s)]
*  doing sounds fun but you got drunk as shit off of one glass of wine which is probably pretty [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5412.4400000000005s)]
*  awesome and you were probably it probably tastes so good too being that dehydrated and then you're [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5417.0s)]
*  dehydrating yourself more because of the wine so probably aids a little bit in the water cut [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5421.88s)]
*  because it does dehydrate you yeah but then that hangover when you got no water in your body [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5426.44s)]
*  yeah I don't fuck with hangovers anymore dude that's why I stopped drinking I stopped drinking [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5433.16s)]

*  on the phone with the cops and apparently allegedly threatened the cops when he was on the phone which [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5559.5599999999995s)]
*  is not good yeah not good and he's already got a history of running from accidents yeah yeah I hope [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5565.08s)]
*  he gets whatever that is I hope that he figures it out you know yeah I hope so too but you know [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5571.48s)]
*  it is what it is yeah some people yeah they like riding the lightning bro he liked riding that [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5577.16s)]
*  lightning yeah and I think that's one of the things that made him so good too because he was [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5582.6s)]
*  so wild he was just a wild dude yeah you know he just genuinely didn't give a fuck and really had [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5586.52s)]
*  this ultimate confidence and so skillful and so smart but eventually you know one more one more [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5592.280000000001s)]

*  fucking beast man yeah I know there's a lot of questions never been out of the first round a lot [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5607.320000000001s)]
*  of questions but never been out of the first round because he fucks everybody up in the first [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5611.64s)]
*  round like that's a factor yeah you know yeah I really wanted to see that fight but also at the [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5615.4800000000005s)]
*  same time I kind of I appreciate it I forget which interview it was recently but John was pretty [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5620.6s)]
*  honest in it he was like look man like I don't want to fight up and coming tough guys he was like I [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5625.320000000001s)]
*  want to fight guys with seasoned champions that have names and I was like that could also be [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5630.68s)]
*  interpreted as you don't really want to fight kind of the best guys that there are right now [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5637.88s)]
*  you want to fight like a certain category of fighter who you're comfortable fighting but you [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5643.24s)]
*  don't want to fight the guys that are tough and that are saying that you're going to win and that's [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5649.24s)]
*  okay but that's essentially how I interpreted what he was saying in different words which I [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5653.64s)]
*  appreciated the honesty well it's also money fights right yeah because I think he's wrong [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5658.68s)]
*  because I think Aspinall is a star I really do yeah I do too I and I don't I think he's saying [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5664.2s)]
*  who is he he's not no one Aspinall's a star when I get when people ask questions to me all the time [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5669.639999999999s)]
*  like casuals on the street is John Jones gonna fight Tom Aspinall it's constant that's like the [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5676.36s)]
*  constant question to me the real fight would have been John Jones versus Francis that's the real [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5681.24s)]
*  yeah if I like clearly I'm not responsible for making decisions because I would have made a lot [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5687.32s)]
*  of different decisions and I would have like Francis let's let's talk let's work this out [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5693.8s)]
*  that guy's a star Francis is the fucking scariest heavyweight of all time yeah that's a star you [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5699.8s)]
*  know like that guy as the heavyweight champion is so fucking marketable he puts people into orbit [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5705.320000000001s)]
*  yeah you know he flatlines steep a he flatlined Alistair he flatlines people he's fucking terrifying [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5711.24s)]
*  like that's the heavyweight champion and for that guy to walk away from the belt and then [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5718.36s)]
*  almost beat Tyson Fury and then get knocked out by Anthony Joshua and then to come back and [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5724.599999999999s)]
*  destroy that dude in PFL what's his name again um the big tall Brazilian dude that he ground and [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5729.48s)]
*  pounded into unconsciousness um-hmm Ferreira that's right oh okay that that guy's oh yeah [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5737.96s)]
*  yeah that guy was oh yeah yeah they're really jacked yeah and he's the guy that KO'd Ryan [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5745.16s)]
*  Bader in the first round he looks phenomenal he's terrifying and Francis just destroyed him like [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5749.96s)]
*  that's the guy that's the guy like and everybody knows that's the guy like that's the fight that [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5754.68s)]
*  that's the big fight it's a shame when that shit happens in the sport dude it's the worst I hate it [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5761.16s)]
*  I hate it I see it happen all of the time and I can't help but think a lot of it is like [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5765.8s)]
*  hopefully it's just maybe money business stuff but I really I think that some of it is ego and [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5770.52s)]
*  that's kind of what I try to drift drift like just drift away from yeah um my philosophy on winning [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5775.4800000000005s)]
*  the belt has always been if I can't beat whoever it is if it's like a number 10 ranked umar or if [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5782.4400000000005s)]
*  it's a number two ranked whoever if I can't beat that person then I don't deserve the belt and I [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5788.4400000000005s)]
*  don't think that I should get it like uh I'm it clearly doesn't represent what it represents if [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5792.92s)]
*  it doesn't mean that I beat all the best guys on the way to doing so right um not everyone really [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5798.68s)]
*  has that philosophy and I get it because once you start involving money and then money is taking [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5803.64s)]
*  care of your family which is what you know is kind of an excuse to be greedy sometimes for people [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5808.4400000000005s)]
*  uh it just kind of it's just never really been my philosophy and I think that it's kind of a shame [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5815.08s)]
*  when that stuff happens because in my head we're doing two things we're seeing who the best fighter [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5820.280000000001s)]
*  in the world is and we're getting people to watch so that the fans can appreciate something that I [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5825.64s)]
*  find to be the most loved thing in my life next to my wife you know so um I don't know I think [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5832.04s)]
*  it's a shame when that shit happens especially when it's like a uh an ego thing but also at the [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5840.12s)]
*  same time I don't really think that that's too much of what John Jones is doing I'm more speaking in [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5844.52s)]
*  terms of what I kind of see in other people I think John Jones also has to have some level [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5850.28s)]
*  of awareness around Tom's a young guy and we age you know we age and that's okay John's not a [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5855.96s)]
*  natural heavyweight either that too I mean John still could make 205 yeah yeah he yeah even in [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5863.96s)]
*  his heavyweight fight he looked like a little soft yeah yeah a little soft and like 240 and a little [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5870.44s)]
*  soft is I mean think about how much Pereira cuts right he got that weight like he could still make [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5876.28s)]
*  205 and might still be the champ at 205 yeah you know which is kind of wild yeah and Tom Aspinall [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5882.12s)]
*  ain't making 205 that guy's fucking huge yeah and Gano is not making 205 Francis would cut to get to [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5888.5199999999995s)]
*  265 natural sure which is just bananas yeah he's a fucking hulking man yeah yeah he's a scary dude [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5895.32s)]
*  how do people get that big genetics man is that what it is genetics yeah I mean that's just pure [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5902.6s)]
*  genetics if I was that big I'm playing a different sport bro playing hockey hockey or fucking baseball [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5907.8s)]
*  or football but football the brain damage you get in football is significantly more probably than [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5915.08s)]
*  the brand brain damage you get fighting you like hockey I do I like watching he's pretty cool yeah [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5919.56s)]
*  I like I like hockey culture I don't really understand the game because there's too much [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5925.240000000001s)]
*  going on right now or like when it's happening it just like looks like a chaotic mess sometimes [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5929.4s)]
*  to me but I recently started watching it because a dude from the abs I'm getting I've been like [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5934.36s)]
*  seeing him at the gym a little bit he's been training a guy named Nathan McKinnon who's like [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5939.5599999999995s)]
*  one of the better guys in the league right now I've kind of been paying a little bit of attention [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5942.92s)]
*  because me and him will chat sometimes but dude hockey culture is cool like when they score they [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5947.0s)]
*  smile and cheer for a half of a second and then they're all just like stone cold killers back [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5952.44s)]
*  again which I really appreciate about sports because I feel like a lot of sports have become [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5957.08s)]
*  like like all of this top players are like really super starry like flamboyant like the thing about [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5962.92s)]
*  hockey is it's never been as popular as football I know it's always been the steps the steps on [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5970.28s)]
*  it's like not quite the same not in the same like they don't they don't reach the same you have a [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5977.08s)]
*  few gretzky's you know bobby ore you have a few guys have become national celebrities but for the [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5984.04s)]
*  most part there's not like a whole ton of them that everybody the general public knows about [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5988.92s)]
*  so because of that they're probably a little more dedicated a little more humble a little more on [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5993.88s)]
*  the grind they're cool they're cool to me I really like that sport it's very athletic sport man yeah [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=5998.92s)]
*  the fucking amount of energy that those guys expend the speed they're fast constantly sprinting [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6004.68s)]
*  on ice you know and maneuvering and gliding around those blades is incredible to watch [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6011.0s)]
*  you like any other sports I like soccer I like watching soccer nice you know when I really [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6016.68s)]
*  enjoyed soccer when I went to see a live match I was like oh and then I was talking to my friend [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6020.68s)]
*  ed was one of the owners of the Austin club here and he was explaining to me like this is the [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6025.32s)]
*  reason why it never becomes popular in America they don't take commercial breaks there's no time [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6030.84s)]
*  for a commercial break the fucking clock is always running oh I never noticed and these guys [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6036.68s)]
*  these guys have legs they're like fucking quarter horses they're these fucking huge legs [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6041.08s)]

*  shape yeah you know it's like as like someone who appreciates athletic performance like this is a [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6050.6s)]
*  crazy sport like a really demanding sport how many miles do you think they run every game [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6056.200000000001s)]
*  I don't know man at least four five it has to be they're constantly running like seven to nine [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6060.68s)]
*  usually seven to nine miles every game that's bananas yeah that's a lot they're not jogging [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6066.280000000001s)]

*  Netherlands that I was talking about I grew up playing soccer a little bit too but I only did [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6078.6s)]
*  it until like people stopped thinking it was cool and then I like switched to switch sports I was [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6082.76s)]
*  like dude when you're growing up all of the goal is just to not be called gay [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6087.08s)]
*  and soccer didn't do that for you you know so true but dude it's just your entire existence as a kid [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6093.48s)]
*  is to not be made fun of and called gay yeah you were a dork if you played soccer yeah but uh oh [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6099.8s)]

*  adjustment to reach their level have you ever been to a game where there's all of the SWAT people [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6135.88s)]

*  because they're really the only globalized or one of the only super globalized where people from all [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6285.88s)]

*  have something super in common with someone which is just like a cool feeling you know I think another [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6299.4s)]
*  thing that's really cool about it is when someone is elite no one cares what country they're from [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6305.0s)]
*  they just love that guy you know it's like if if Adesanya gets in there no one cares he's from New [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6309.0s)]
*  Zealand everybody gets pumped if Pereira gets in there it's Alex Pereira's fighting you don't say [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6314.12s)]

*  accept that people come from different parts of the world yeah about 300 years ago we were all like [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6381.16s)]
*  go to this party I know fucking party over there man we could do whatever we want over there [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6385.88s)]
*  bullshit that we got going on here it's kind of nutty in that regard and you know and boy it's [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6391.16s)]
*  worked out yeah a lot of ways yeah I'm not really like uh I try not to be like too identified with [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6396.2s)]
*  anything or whatever or like be too nationalist but every time I think of like just how lucky we are [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6403.72s)]
*  to be from here dude it's pretty cool it's pretty amazing it is it's especially when you see stuff [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6408.68s)]
*  like that's going on with Israel and Iran and all of that stuff it's kind of like [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6413.4s)]
*  God man thank God that we're here in the UK people are getting arrested for Facebook posts [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6418.04s)]
*  are they yeah thousands they still use Facebook fucking losers what the fuck they doing using [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6423.32s)]
*  Facebook that's how you know it's a political thing it's all those old people old people on [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6429.719999999999s)]
*  Facebook all my old friends from high school like my old friends that I was friends with when I was [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6434.36s)]
*  like really young they are they're on Facebook yeah old dudes love Facebook my mom and dad are [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6439.08s)]
*  on Facebook they argue about politics on Facebook like fucking miss me with that shit yeah they [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6443.8s)]
*  post about which neighbors yeah I got zero time for any of that stupidity yeah but this you know [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6448.44s)]
*  this thing that we've done over here is allowing people to express themselves whether you agree or [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6456.68s)]
*  disagree that is just so gigantic and what they're squashing a lot of that in other countries [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6462.44s)]
*  and that scares the shit out of me that's what I was really scared about in this last election [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6468.92s)]
*  because because I'm friends with Elon I knew what was going on in Twitter behind the scenes I knew [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6472.68s)]
*  how the government was stepping in and silencing posts and like this is fucking dangerous man yeah [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6479.32s)]
*  because if they get a real grip on social media and you no longer can protest about things and [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6485.56s)]
*  express yourself about things including a lot of things that happen to be true like during the [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6492.04s)]
*  COVID crisis you people are getting their accounts banned for posting factual information [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6496.68s)]
*  yeah that that was scary to me because that's very very un-American you have to be okay with [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6502.92s)]
*  that for all the good and the bad that comes with it like you just have to you have to be okay with [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6508.12s)]
*  like the people saying things you don't like it's going to come with a lot of good and a lot of bad [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6512.52s)]
*  but you have to be okay with it because when it's your turn at plate like you're going to want to be [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6516.280000000001s)]
*  you're going to want to have your opinion respected too 100 and that's what people have to realize when [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6520.280000000001s)]
*  it's so easy when like especially in this country all tech is primarily left and they have a very [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6525.0s)]
*  strong ideology this very progressive left-wing ideology which is like all over the tech world [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6532.68s)]
*  and when they were in control and they were silencing things I think the attitude was this [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6538.36s)]
*  is good because we're right and we need to stop these fascists or whatever we want to call them [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6543.64s)]
*  you know and but the problem is then what if the fucking right gets in place and they use the same [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6548.76s)]
*  rules that you used on them now we don't have a country anymore now we're fucked now we're just [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6553.32s)]
*  like every other dictatorship I don't really know how you solve it I've kind of thought about like [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6557.16s)]
*  how to like get to a place where there can be world peace and all of that stuff I don't know [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6562.2s)]
*  I think that a lot of people I know you've talked about it a lot they get really attached to the [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6566.92s)]
*  egos and the identities that exist inside them and then they see the world from only that perspective [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6571.08s)]
*  that's why I think that like a lot of the old religions and the old like echoed through time [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6576.679999999999s)]
*  ways of being are to you know destroy your ego eliminate yourself be like this watcher of your [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6582.44s)]
*  thoughts and all of that stuff and then start to identify with the watcher of what you think that [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6587.879999999999s)]
*  you really are and then once you spend enough time doing that you'll spend enough time realizing that [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6593.639999999999s)]
*  everyone else has that watcher inside them and that maybe they don't realize it yet but they're [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6599.0s)]
*  still really connected to their egos that are really just a bunch of ideas that were indoctrinated [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6603.719999999999s)]
*  to them based off of our environment or who we grew up with and all of that stuff and then you [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6608.44s)]
*  can start to love people a little bit more and absolutely it's it's kind of a shame that I just [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6612.919999999999s)]
*  know that that's not super big in the west that idea just it's kind of an eastern philosophy you [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6619.4s)]
*  know like be like we just meditate here like that's just such a like a bitch ass way to think about [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6626.12s)]
*  doing it like that's what you're doing is you're settling in to being able to watch what you think [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6631.719999999999s)]
*  you really are and be like hey if I don't want to be that anymore I don't have to be that or if I [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6636.92s)]
*  if that doesn't serve me anymore I don't have to be that this is one thing that I walk through a lot [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6642.04s)]
*  of my guys with in fighting is it's like you want to not be scared of something don't desire anything [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6646.12s)]
*  and don't be anything if you don't want to be scared because fighting fearless is a really big [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6651.88s)]
*  thing I think that I do a really good job of performing really well because I'm not scared [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6656.36s)]
*  of a lot of things because I don't have a ton of egos inside of my brain as much anymore I of course [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6661.4800000000005s)]
*  do because we all have to but uh but yeah once you start spending a lot of time with that watcher [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6665.96s)]
*  I think that that's kind of why it always ends on the idea of love being the answer is because [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6671.88s)]
*  once you spend time disconnecting from what we think we are it can you always end up in the spot [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6679.32s)]
*  where it's like oh that person's that they just haven't figured it out yet either and I love them [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6684.28s)]
*  for that still and that acceptance and love is empowering both you and to them whereas like hate [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6688.2s)]
*  of other people I mean it might motivate you in some way but it's also crippling you know what is [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6694.04s)]
*  that old expression that uh anger is the is the emotion that poisons the vessel that holds it [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6699.24s)]
*  you know this is you're you're wasting energy you're wasting life and you're you're wasting [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6707.0s)]
*  your potential because you're you're thinking only in terms of negative all the time and negative is [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6712.04s)]
*  never constructive yeah you don't have to you don't have to think like that to be successful [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6717.48s)]
*  or to be competitive or in any way you can be empty there's yeah there's a lot of energies in [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6722.04s)]
*  life that will serve you I think up to a certain point um that just will stop serving you because [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6727.88s)]
*  it's just not it's not a fuel that you can sustain for long enough you know did you develop this [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6734.12s)]
*  philosophy from reading did you were you taught it like how did you fuck load of mushrooms no [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6740.76s)]
*  not a time are you kidding not a ton no I think that's the answer when you were asking a little [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6747.16s)]
*  what's the answer to world peace it might be that it might be because I mean that definitely rips [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6750.92s)]
*  you out of your body and fucking scares the shit out of you sometimes but humbles you yeah it does [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6754.92s)]
*  um yeah um no it was it's a lot of reading it's a lot of like I've been fascinated by religion [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6759.8s)]
*  my entire life I was raised um pretty not like crazy not like religious in like a dogmatic way [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6766.6s)]
*  but religious in like a hey think about these things type of way by my parents which I'm really [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6773.16s)]
*  grateful because I developed a super healthy understanding of those types of ideas where they [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6778.12s)]
*  didn't feel like there was something I was latched on to as much as they were things to be explored [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6784.599999999999s)]
*  and so it kind of started when I was really young I'd just been fascinated by the idea of God like [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6789.72s)]
*  in church when they're like hey you're gonna burn in hell forever if you don't agree with this [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6795.32s)]
*  that became number one priority from that day on dude I was like hell once I could understand [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6801.400000000001s)]
*  hell and forever I was like that's okay I was like oh okay so nothing else matters in life like we [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6808.04s)]
*  got to figure this out right now um so that kind of took me on like a really religious thing and [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6814.04s)]
*  then after I lost my first fight that was my big first experience with facing an ego that I didn't [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6818.92s)]
*  have control over when I was your first loss uh it was against a guy named Jamal Emers who's [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6827.08s)]
*  actually in the UFC now but it was pretty much just I shit the bed and choked um I would have [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6831.160000000001s)]
*  got signed to the UFC and I just choked and lost and um I was supposed to in my head and based off [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6836.04s)]
*  of what everyone around me was telling me I was supposed to be this like super big prospect guy [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6843.400000000001s)]
*  blah blah blah after I lost I had to face that maybe that's not what I am when you say choked [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6847.96s)]
*  what about your performance do you think went wrong I just didn't show up like the way I mean [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6854.28s)]
*  I was five and oh I was still really new to the you know being a professional and being able to [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6858.36s)]
*  perform under high stakes if I would have won I think I for sure would have gotten signed to the [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6862.44s)]
*  UFC just because I had been training with TJ my word was around them a lot it was went back to [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6867.0s)]
*  when you didn't have to get signed by the contender or anything they just would call you up on a day [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6873.08s)]
*  but you kind of had to have a little bit of it in or be doing really well or something so um yeah [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6877.32s)]
*  so that was like my first big experience with that I spent about that entire summer um as much [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6882.6s)]
*  as I could in the mountains I didn't even really train because I didn't even know if that's something [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6888.92s)]
*  that I wanted to continue doing just because losing hurt my heart so bad how did you lose [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6892.6s)]
*  just a decision dude it wasn't even like gnarly it was just like afterwards I was like [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6898.04s)]
*  but I was supposed to win it's like someone fucked up here man I was supposed to win that [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6901.96s)]
*  and so it's just like oh so maybe this universe doesn't revolve around me and like my ideas and [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6910.6s)]
*  who I think I am and all of that stuff and then so spent a lot of time in nature read a lot of [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6917.320000000001s)]
*  books like power now a lot of buddhist stuff a lot of tig nan han stuff a lot of um just spirituality [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6922.84s)]
*  books but just the overarching idea of separating yourself from your thoughts and your body and all [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6930.2s)]
*  of that stuff and just whether it's in our imagination or not because I'm still not fully [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6935.64s)]
*  bought into any of that stuff like I don't have any beliefs is what I say now um but I'm willing [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6940.200000000001s)]
*  to entertain a lot of stuff and I want to believe something really bad because it would make life [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6945.4800000000005s)]
*  a lot easier to like navigate through exactly the same way dude it'd be so much easier if I've [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6949.56s)]
*  always said someone come up with a great cult yeah come up with a really great cult I'll join [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6954.280000000001s)]
*  I'll come up with one if you fucking like have like a really benevolent leader that really is [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6958.68s)]
*  an actual real guru and it makes sense and no one's fucking everybody I was gonna say [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6964.28s)]
*  are we allowing everyone to have sex with each other no well it's not it's usually a leader [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6969.639999999999s)]
*  yeah leader gets to fuck everybody yeah the leader gets to fuck everybody and he wants your money [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6974.919999999999s)]
*  yeah yeah but if that could be avoided but it would just make things easier but it really wouldn't [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6979.32s)]
*  right you're better off without a real belief system but sort of entertaining a lot of belief [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6984.12s)]
*  systems I kind of land on this idea of so I've been trying to write a comic book for the last [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6989.16s)]
*  couple years really yeah I know writing is a little gay or whatever but that's why I spend [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6994.92s)]
*  a lot of money gay yeah it's gay to some people but it's like poetry yeah yeah they're gay if [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=6998.599999999999s)]
*  you're afraid of writing yeah um so I uh I spend a lot of time writing it's like what I do with my [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7003.16s)]
*  free time instead of golfing uh but um like what kind of write like how do you write uh well for [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7009.24s)]
*  last couple years it's been trying to write a pretty in-depth comic book which has been really [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7015.08s)]
*  fun are you a comic book fan uh I'm a comic book fan but honestly dude how it happened is I was [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7019.88s)]
*  like I wanted to come up with this really cool story I'm just an idea machine like I just think [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7024.52s)]
*  of ideas all day like I don't have many hobbies I think it's super fun just me hanging out with me [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7028.76s)]
*  inside my head all day um so I uh cool yeah I came up with this really cool idea which is essentially [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7033.24s)]
*  like a bunch of ideas from a bunch of religions that I really like and then putting them into [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7040.5199999999995s)]
*  a story and the story is um okay we got some time for me to explain this sure okay I think [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7045.96s)]
*  it's pretty interesting um but I haven't really like broken it down from start to finish really [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7053.5599999999995s)]
*  but I got into writing just because I wanted to make this story of mine oh that's what you asked [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7059.639999999999s)]
*  me is it am I into comic books I tried writing a sentence like it started out in the August 5th [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7065.72s)]
*  of two and I was like fuck this dude we're doing a comic I can't write sentences I was like and I [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7075.320000000001s)]
*  read good books so I like know what a good sentence is and I was like oh no that's gonna [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7081.88s)]
*  take way too long we're doing only dialogue and pictures and so uh that's why I started doing [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7085.96s)]
*  comic books although I do really like comic books too um but yeah so it's kind of this uh [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7091.48s)]
*  it's like a compilation of a lot of ideas that I like about religion inside of um this world that [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7097.0s)]
*  exists today I actually put um a conversation between you and Duncan Duncan Trussell in it [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7103.879999999999s)]
*  I'm not gonna do anything with the comic book so it's really fun like to know that I just have fun [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7109.639999999999s)]
*  doing it like I'm not really don't plan on publishing it maybe but I think honestly to [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7114.36s)]
*  it would take like another two three years for it to be super solid enough for me to want to put out [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7118.84s)]
*  there um but there's a dialogue between you and Duncan Trussell I really love Duncan Trussell he's [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7123.16s)]
*  like one of my favorite people of all time I got to meet him at the Comedy Works in Denver pretty [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7128.4400000000005s)]
*  recently uh he's the best yeah he's really cool I love that guy yeah but pretty much it takes place [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7134.12s)]
*  where this guy uh goes to the Garden of Eden that's being protected by these uh tribes people and [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7139.32s)]
*  inside of the Garden of Eden are these trees called Kali's where when you eat the fruit of [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7147.8s)]
*  them or you eat the crystals of them you get teleported to a place where the sixth lives [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7153.96s)]
*  and the sixth is like the god of our universe um the world takes place in uh densities which are [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7159.64s)]
*  pretty much our chakras so there's seven of them the first density second density third density which [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7167.88s)]
*  is what we are as humans the fourth are aliens um we're like we're humans that have merged with [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7173.88s)]
*  the technologies that we've created it takes place about 20 or 30 years in the future where AI [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7180.28s)]
*  is um a real like actual fucking player in the game you know um fourth is aliens fifth is like [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7186.04s)]
*  psychedelic creatures slash angels slash all of that stuff sixth is the gods of the universe [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7194.28s)]
*  seventh is the all it's just like love it's everything and so it's a heavy comic book man [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7201.24s)]
*  yeah it's pretty in-depth dude I mean it's not like simple shit it's not like fucking some guy [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7207.24s)]
*  goes and saves the world it's like a pretty the lore of it is pretty cool I think so you go through [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7212.36s)]
*  each density our souls do um for billions and trillions and however whatever past whatever's [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7217.8s)]
*  past trillions um of lifetimes and you spend time in those densities learning what it is to learn [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7224.04s)]
*  in those densities so right now in the third density because it's the power chakra of life [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7231.56s)]
*  what we're trying to do is discover that the positive path of love is what we're really [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7237.88s)]
*  shooting for instead of the negative one and what that means is the positive path is um [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7243.88s)]
*  um in we're doing things in service of others instead of in service of self so we're choosing [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7250.68s)]
*  love of others over love of self because love isn't like an emotion in the book it's like a [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7257.16s)]
*  structural building of the world where everything is love it's this all it's this it's not like [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7262.92s)]
*  disney shit it's like a structural way of building the universe so choosing to be in love of others [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7268.04s)]
*  is what we're doing but earth is in its late third density getting ready to move into its fourth [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7275.8s)]
*  density and this scientist who interacts with this tribe takes a seed from the kali and grows them [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7280.92s)]
*  and makes it so that the entire world can take this fruit and then interact with god and then [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7289.56s)]
*  what it would be like in in this world today if we were actually able to sit in front of god and [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7296.28s)]
*  ask god questions and that's kind of the basis of the book it's pretty cool yeah there's a little [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7303.0s)]
*  you doing the illustrations now i call the guy about doing the illustrator i might wait till ai [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7308.28s)]
*  gets good enough because when i got quit yeah which we're pretty close i i fuck around with ai a lot [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7312.68s)]
*  too but we're pretty close to um uh i think getting there with like some apps where you can have [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7317.24s)]
*  consistent characters because it's hard to do stuff because you can't make the characters super [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7324.04s)]
*  consistent but i think we're like a year or two away from being able to do that even a year or [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7328.4400000000005s)]
*  two yeah maybe not i think we're in this very bizarre stage right now where i don't think people [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7331.96s)]
*  realize what's coming and i think it's gonna hit us like a fucking freight train so i know everyone [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7336.76s)]
*  has like a thousand stories there's like a thousand stories about ai taking over and all of this stuff [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7341.96s)]
*  in my book sorry this is okay yeah yeah okay cool um i just know it's long and sometimes i lose track [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7347.08s)]
*  of time okay cool um the ai uh in this story is the way that we get moved into the fourth density [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7355.0s)]
*  and the way that we get moved into the fourth density is when we merge with the nanotechnology [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7363.96s)]
*  that merges with like the ai supercomputer called oblivion which is pretty much just a hive mind [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7370.04s)]
*  once we all get merged with that we either based off of our polarity or our like frequency or [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7376.28s)]
*  whatever that tells us if we're positive or negative if we go negative then we pretty much [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7384.76s)]
*  just extinguish each other because all we care about is love for self and we like kill each other [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7389.16s)]
*  it doesn't say exactly how but you can use your imagination and in the positive way we move together [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7393.56s)]
*  in this hive mind into being aliens essentially where we live millions and trillions of lifetimes [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7400.2s)]
*  as aliens until we can enter into the fifth which then we become psychedelic creatures and all of [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7406.76s)]
*  that stuff or angels or whatever and that's like a non-physical realm at that point but uh but yeah [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7412.84s)]
*  that's pretty much the idea behind the whole book it might be actually what really does happen it's [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7419.72s)]
*  kind of like a positive spin off of it well the best case scenario is we evolve and we merge with [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7424.92s)]
*  ai and we evolve and it's better for everybody and we we become something superior to what we [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7432.6s)]
*  are now worst case scenario is we become irrelevant because they don't need us anymore [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7438.84s)]
*  yeah we're outdated i still think it will still have to be partly us because it was created by us [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7443.08s)]
*  like in like a parallel universe where we are not like say we're fucking lizard people in another [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7449.8s)]
*  universe we see things differently our priorities and values are different we would make a completely [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7455.72s)]
*  different set of ai like there's no way that ai is just this thing that isn't connected to humans [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7461.32s)]
*  in some way so hopefully it's connected to the good parts of us as humans which is like compassion [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7467.48s)]
*  love caring for each other and not like a lizard reptilian right like hey let's just we got to [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7474.44s)]
*  maximize and capitalism and all of that stuff you know what i mean so um that's a lot of what the [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7481.0s)]
*  book is about too is it's just about like hey maybe it won't be so bad like maybe this thing will have [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7486.5199999999995s)]
*  more human traits than or maybe we're more awesome than what we what we actually think you know i [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7492.28s)]
*  think the hive mind thing is promising because and i have a feeling that that's where we're headed [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7497.88s)]
*  i have a feeling that if with either some wearable or some sort of technology with an implant where [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7502.5199999999995s)]
*  we no longer require language to communicate with each other and we essentially have instantaneous [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7509.48s)]
*  access to everyone all the time and the thing that people are going to have to deal with is that there's [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7515.639999999999s)]
*  going to be no more secrets there'll be no more lies there'll be it's going to be impossible to [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7520.44s)]
*  deceive everyone's going to know exactly what's going on in your soul like how you interface with [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7524.839999999999s)]
*  the world itself that's cool i think that's probably where we're headed i think if we don't [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7529.799999999999s)]
*  we're going to we're going to become obsolete i think it's one of two things either we become [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7534.679999999999s)]
*  obsolete and ai becomes a new digital form of life that's far more intelligent far more capable [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7539.24s)]
*  than we are and then it makes better and better versions of itself until it makes god [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7545.639999999999s)]
*  or we merge and we we just transcend whatever this state of being these primitive territorial apes [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7550.2s)]
*  with very sophisticated weapons we become something something different if i did have beliefs i would [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7559.88s)]
*  like to believe that it is going towards a god or something or there is like some point to all of the [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7566.679999999999s)]
*  like hard times that we have in life and we're actually progressing whether it be through many [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7573.88s)]
*  lifetimes or in other universes or dimensions or whatever and something inside of us that isn't [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7577.96s)]
*  human but is maybe a watcher or something is progressing towards something great and loving [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7583.72s)]
*  and more beautiful than what we got going on here on earth and if if that is true then ai will [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7589.4s)]
*  probably be pretty awesome yeah you know if that is true yeah well that's best case scenario right [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7597.16s)]
*  i think we're it's also very strange that we are in this position it's very strange that we are [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7603.0s)]
*  living our lives at this unbelievable unique moment in history where things are going to change in [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7608.92s)]
*  this undeniably radical way unless something happens unless we blow ourselves up or we get [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7615.32s)]
*  hit by an asteroid it's going to happen and it's going to happen probably within the next 10 years [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7619.8s)]
*  like 10 years from now we're going to be looking back remember the old days of 2025 when you didn't [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7626.2s)]
*  know what was coming i know you know i i want to be like hey you're over exaggerating that but dude [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7630.68s)]
*  if you think about the world five years ago it was completely different completely just the invention [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7637.16s)]
*  of ai just the last few years yeah just the last few years we're all like bunker down in our house [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7640.68s)]
*  and shit five years ago well even the ufc five years ago was crazy like life like i only get to [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7645.96s)]
*  view life through the lens of my like job and my love which is through fighting which is cool because [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7652.4400000000005s)]
*  it like helps me understand the macro picture a little bit better but yeah man i mean like even [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7657.88s)]
*  just five years ago how different the ufc was like life is going to be really weird in 10 years yeah [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7662.6s)]
*  it's the whole world is going to be really weird and you know one of the things that always freaks [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7669.88s)]
*  me out about elon and neurolink is one of the statements that he said you're going to be able [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7675.16s)]
*  to talk without using words i don't know how that would work well the hive mind yeah we're [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7679.8s)]
*  going to be able to interact with each other but do but do we just feel each other's feelings then [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7685.16s)]
*  probably yeah yeah or that would be good maybe yeah that would be good if it's like if i don't [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7688.84s)]
*  have like a filter of feeling something my brain making it into words and then spitting it out [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7693.639999999999s)]
*  and it was just i have this feeling and you feel that thing that might be a really great thing [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7699.48s)]
*  i've often thought about the parallels of religion with what's currently going on and one of them [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7703.96s)]
*  being like christ was born of a virgin mother right so christ was born without sex and emerged [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7711.4s)]
*  like what else is born without a without a mother ai ai is born without a mother christ is going to [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7717.88s)]
*  come back ai is coming another one is the tower of babel right did you come up with that yes [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7725.24s)]
*  yeah that's fucking awesome right it seems like it that's awesome right if you if you think that [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7730.5199999999995s)]
*  god is gonna turn yeah well wouldn't it be yeah it's that completely makes sense that's awesome [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7736.120000000001s)]
*  the other one is the tower of babel right so we if we all have a universal language and we are [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7742.04s)]
*  working on this fucking tower to get closer to god to stairway to god and it's do it right and you [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7750.04s)]
*  make it there do it wrong and it becomes completely chaotic and divided and you're scattered across the [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7756.280000000001s)]
*  world with a thousand different fucking languages and nobody can communicate with [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7762.04s)]
*  each other so nobody understand each other and it's just chaos which is what happened to the [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7766.44s)]
*  human race if we develop a universal language and if this universal language is transmitted [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7770.04s)]
*  through whether it's this implant or wearable some sort of interface with technology then we [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7775.96s)]
*  bypass we bypass this primitive state of you know chaotic tribal monkeys and we become something [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7782.36s)]
*  superior yep that's awesome yeah the tower of babel was initially in my story because i've loved [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7789.4s)]
*  that idea for a really long time which is essentially it's just like a symbol for like hey if we all work [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7793.879999999999s)]
*  together we can actually do this thing yeah which is kind of uh the main idea that i got from it [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7799.0s)]
*  yeah dude that's a that's a cool ass idea about ai i'm gonna put that in my book i'm gonna steal [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7804.5199999999995s)]
*  that idea yeah because if you think about it what what what is ai going to be well if super [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7810.36s)]
*  intelligence gets achieved and then you're attaching that to quantum computing right quantum [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7818.28s)]
*  computing right now is only able to just like do integers and you know do do equations but what if [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7823.88s)]
*  quantum computing and ai merge then you've got some insane amount of computational power attached to [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7831.4s)]
*  an insane intelligence that is going to make better and better versions of itself well if you [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7839.48s)]
*  scale that up exponentially 10 20 30 50 100 1000 years you keep going you get a god yeah i mean [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7844.5199999999995s)]
*  imagine i mean quantum imagine too i mean who knows like if we want to go real sci-fi with the [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7852.599999999999s)]
*  idea like quantum particles communicate to each other so maybe they'll be able to communicate with [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7858.599999999999s)]
*  the ones that are in other dimensions and that's how we're able to communicate with other dimensions [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7865.08s)]
*  or whatever well that's the freakiest concept about quantum computing when they said that [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7869.16s)]
*  the way it works is so confusing and it's so powerful that they think it might be evidence [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7873.88s)]
*  of the multiverse yeah now i talked to roman yampolsky who is a a scientist who talks about [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7879.96s)]
*  the dangers of ai and he thought that that was all nonsense he might be right but maybe there's a lot [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7885.799999999999s)]
*  of scientists that believe that it's correct and that this is why quantum computing is so powerful [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7890.5199999999995s)]
*  because mark andresen said this and it's the fucking craziest quote ever that quantum computing [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7895.88s)]
*  it can solve an equation that if you converted the entire universe like every molecule every [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7900.52s)]
*  atom of the universe into a supercomputer it would take so long for the universe as a supercomputer [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7908.76s)]
*  to solve this this problem that the universe would die of heat death before it solved it [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7915.64s)]
*  and quantum computing can solve it in minutes yeah i've seen that instagram reel like what the fuck [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7921.56s)]
*  essentially what we would be doing um i bet you when they were trying to invent electricity they [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7928.280000000001s)]
*  didn't know that it would be this and maybe that's what we're in the middle of except like times [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7933.4800000000005s)]
*  a thousand billion where it's like oh because i always think i'm like we got we're only looking [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7939.160000000001s)]
*  through the lens of the future through all of the inventions that we have now what if we invented [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7945.0s)]
*  something that was like electricity or quantum computing or quantum communication or like if you [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7950.04s)]
*  can change things at a quantum level like maybe i can turn this thing into the hardest steel metal [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7956.92s)]
*  in the entire world and then that just completely changes the board game that we're even playing [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7963.64s)]
*  like we're not even playing the same board game anymore right so it's like i don't know anytime [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7970.52s)]
*  anyone says nothing's possible i'm like you sure because if we just change the board game it can [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7975.8s)]
*  get pretty crazy you can't say nothing's possible because everything that we have today is impossible [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7981.72s)]
*  200 years ago yeah you're a sorcerer if you go back to the 1400s and show them an iphone you know [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7985.4s)]
*  like this none of it makes any sense the fact that you could facetime someone in new zealand right [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7991.48s)]
*  now that's bananas all that stuff is fucking completely insane and it's real and it's happening [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=7995.719999999999s)]
*  right now and the other thing about ai being if artificial super intelligence creates something [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8000.679999999999s)]
*  that we can't even imagine like we're just dealing with this framework this structure that's so [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8007.48s)]
*  antiquated because it's all been created by humans if you get something that's a thousand [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8014.04s)]
*  ten thousand times more intelligent than us and it's going to have solutions to things that we [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8018.44s)]
*  can't even comprehend yeah yeah yeah it's freaky shit you get real weird you know one of the things [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8022.84s)]
*  that always weirded me out about these stories about uh ufo encounters and in particular the [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8028.28s)]
*  the bob lazar story is that when he was working on back engineering these crafts that were supposedly [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8034.84s)]
*  from somewhere else one of the things that he said is there's no controls there's no controls [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8040.76s)]
*  in this thing like they they don't know what is happening between these beings and this craft that [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8046.360000000001s)]
*  they power it but they're probably completely connected to this thing they're like what you're [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8052.84s)]
*  seeing with those those little grays is probably us in the future that's probably what every [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8058.6s)]
*  primate eventually becomes once it integrates with technology it would be really cool if that's like [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8065.24s)]
*  you said what the religions were talking about too like to me the science shit is all cool and [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8071.48s)]
*  stuff but i also like the idea of like intertwining like science modern ideas with really traditional [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8076.04s)]
*  ideas it would be super cool if it was something where it's like hey like once we reach this [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8081.88s)]
*  certain of technological advancement there is a spiritual religious side to the thing that we [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8087.4s)]
*  also make discoveries in too that would be cool it would be cool to have a belief yeah if you [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8093.32s)]
*  got well you know if artificial super intelligence does become live it all belief systems are going [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8099.719999999999s)]
*  to get thrown into the woodchipper we're not going to know what the fuck is what unless it tells us [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8105.88s)]
*  yeah i mean yeah but i have a feeling that a lot of these stories like these ancient religious [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8111.16s)]
*  stories they're based on truth it's just truth that was a spoken word thing by people who really [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8115.16s)]
*  couldn't even read because they were illiterate and that they had these tales that were they're [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8121.24s)]
*  told for a thousand years for anybody wrote them down they're writing them down in these ancient [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8126.36s)]
*  languages that even when you take those ancient languages and you try to translate into like [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8130.28s)]
*  modern english a lot is lost in the the translation but i think there's something to all of it there's [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8135.48s)]
*  something they're trying they don't they're not telling stories for no reason i think they're [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8141.16s)]
*  telling these stories because they're trying to document something and i just don't think we get [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8146.76s)]
*  a full picture of it but there's so much truth in those stories and there's so many lessons in [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8151.4800000000005s)]
*  those stories that are applicable and that resonate today i think it'd be foolish to dismiss them [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8156.12s)]
*  definitely um i mean carl young harps on that a lot with their collective unconscious stuff [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8163.16s)]
*  do you know joseph campbell do you follow that guy i love joseph campbell oh it's amazing i got [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8169.4800000000005s)]
*  super into joseph campbell around that time when i was kind of um you know doing the whole figuring [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8173.56s)]
*  myself out part after losing but i mean the idea that there's a pretty much a blueprint to all of [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8180.360000000001s)]
*  the stories that are across civilization is crazy it's like the pyramids being everywhere like we [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8187.080000000001s)]
*  it's just naturally ingrained to us for stories to be like superhero gets called to action finds a [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8194.68s)]
*  guy beats monster beats mega big monster returns back home like that's like the blueprint to a lot [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8201.56s)]
*  of stories and i think it just goes underneath the rug because we're just so used to all of the [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8208.039999999999s)]
*  stories being like that um i've messed around like i said like i spend a lot of time in my head [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8211.88s)]
*  um i don't really like talk a ton i kind of just but i've done the whole like hero's journey thing [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8218.84s)]
*  in my head during the joseph campbell time i could share with you it's kind of fun sure okay um [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8225.16s)]
*  uh i just come up with stories and shit in my head but anyway so i did my own hero's journey [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8231.4s)]
*  during that time when i was trying to eliminate all of the egos inside of me and the easiest way [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8236.92s)]
*  to identify one of your egos is to ask yourself what is it that you feel like you desire you know [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8243.24s)]
*  that's why i think in buddhist philosophy and all of that stuff it's always like [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8249.16s)]
*  let go of attachments like oh your desires and that will lead like just good shit will happen if [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8253.640000000001s)]
*  you do that and i was like okay cool i'll buy into that a little bit so i tried to identify all of [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8258.28s)]
*  these egos that were inside of me i even went as far as naming all of them and giving them [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8263.560000000001s)]
*  characteristics and personalities like when i would notice an angry person inside of me i would just [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8268.52s)]
*  name it samson give it a tiger's face and like uh just treat it as a completely separate imaginary [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8273.640000000001s)]
*  imaginative piece of my psyche that i no longer wanted to be attached with anymore [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8280.76s)]
*  um which is uh an idea that i came up with myself at the time but it's a old idea there's a really [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8285.8s)]
*  good book called taming your gremlins if anyone wants to look into that idea more um that guy [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8291.4s)]
*  does a really good job of doing that so anyways i started going through like my hero's journey [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8296.44s)]
*  and um i spend a lot of time like meditating a decent amount but not just like normal meditating [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8302.28s)]
*  like fucking around in my own head type of meditating and just seeing what type of [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8307.960000000001s)]
*  unconscious things are kind of below the surface of my everyday like corey me and so [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8313.16s)]
*  i'm walking myself through like okay what is this what are all of these things inside me or what are [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8319.72s)]
*  these desires that are inside me i would name them i would turn them into a monster and i would kill [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8324.84s)]
*  the monster and then at the at the very end of this story and i'm like crying during this process [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8329.56s)]
*  when i was doing it or whatever in the hero's journey a lot of the time you have a mentor [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8336.76s)]
*  like a yoda um you have this thing that kind of guides you through how to defeat all these monsters [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8342.76s)]
*  all of it so i get to the end of my story and one part that they never really bring up in heroic [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8348.28s)]
*  stories is the return back home um which is a really big deal like you've just eliminated all [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8353.800000000001s)]
*  of this stuff and now you got to return back home so i'm getting ready to return back home [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8358.92s)]
*  and my mentor at the time because i did grow up really religious um it was jesus at the time [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8363.56s)]
*  we're like jesus was my homie at the time you know he was like this guy and so we get done [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8369.8s)]
*  defeating all of these monsters and we're sitting at the cliff and it's like okay time to go home [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8374.599999999999s)]
*  and he's like hey man like you got one more monster to defeat and i was like well what is it and he [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8378.759999999998s)]
*  was like me and i was like what are you talking about and he was like man like i'm the last thing [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8384.199999999999s)]
*  that you're attached to like in order for you to continue on i'm the thing that you got to defeat [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8388.84s)]
*  and i was like what was that mean dude i'm not about to stab you bro you know and he was like [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8395.48s)]
*  you have to push me and i was like push you off the cliff he was like you have to let go of me [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8400.439999999999s)]
*  the same way that you let go of all of your other desires and fears and things inside of you too [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8405.24s)]
*  if you really want to do it and so i'm like bawling crying because that's that was like a big [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8409.8s)]
*  like that was a big thing so i do it and jesus falls but then he grows wings flies away and says [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8414.84s)]
*  to me now you can be like me and then just flies off into the the whatever and then i return back [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8423.0s)]
*  home and i just remember that being a really big moment for me in my i don't like to use the word [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8431.24s)]
*  spiritual because it sounds stupid but that was like a big deal for me in my development as a person [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8436.92s)]
*  because it really like made me understand and they weren't things that i was planning out [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8444.04s)]
*  they were just unconscious things that were hitting me like over and over and over again [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8448.76s)]
*  i found that through hypnosis and through like trying to see what's underneath things you can't [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8452.52s)]
*  talk to it you can't tell it what to do you can't control your unconscious you just have to watch [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8456.6s)]
*  what's underneath there so it's just like a thing where it's like now i get to be like you was like [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8461.72s)]
*  a really cool thing that just like popped into my head and i was like well shit that's cool [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8467.48s)]
*  that is cool yeah i do a lot of crazy shit inside of my own head i guess probably makes me sound [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8472.12s)]
*  maybe a little bit weird but that's kind of where it's good that's me yeah where it is good what was [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8477.16s)]
*  it like returning to fighting after this like trying to find yourself period yeah um i remember [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8482.28s)]
*  i was folding laundry and they asked me to fight this guy uh tahinio galval on four weeks notice [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8489.48s)]
*  for lfa and tahinio galval is fucking savage at the time um still still i think is doing pretty [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8495.88s)]
*  well but literally every youtube video i could find of him was just knocking people out he was [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8503.0s)]
*  like six and oh or something and just murdering people brazilian guy and i was like i don't think [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8507.56s)]
*  that was a good idea like i just lost i don't really want to lose again and i remember going [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8512.84s)]
*  back and forth with myself big time and as i was folding laundry i kind of got hit with another [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8518.52s)]
*  bit of uh wisdom that came from wherever not from myself came from wherever and in this bit of wisdom [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8524.36s)]
*  it told me man i gave you this life for you for you to make it up yourself quit asking me to make [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8531.08s)]
*  decisions for you and so i was like all right fuck it i'll do it you know um i'll do it and [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8535.560000000001s)]
*  a big piece of me going through that whole thing and what i learned a lot about it was uh love of [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8543.560000000001s)]
*  fighting isn't really love of anything i don't think is like disney shit it's like a mega [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8551.0s)]
*  commitment to something that you want to achieve and it works like a marriage more like a marriage [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8556.76s)]
*  less than like a romantic like hey this is a fling like it's like hey man i might not like you every [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8563.16s)]
*  day you know but i'm going to commit myself to you and i'm going to do this thing and it helped me [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8568.6s)]
*  really wrap my head around what kind of true love is because i feel like that's what true love is [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8573.880000000001s)]
*  and if you want to love this sport and you want to say you love this sport you got to love it on the [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8578.28s)]
*  months days it might last years that you really don't like it and just trust that on the other [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8583.0s)]
*  end of it is like a good experience there's a payoff yeah it's a process yeah so how was the [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8590.04s)]
*  fight it was good i knocked him out in the first round fucking crushed it wasn't scared at all [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8595.8s)]
*  going in really oh yeah i don't get scared much like when i'm actually fighting in that mode of [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8601.32s)]
*  like fight or flight but i've already chosen fight like i'm good you know i don't really get [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8606.6s)]
*  too scared going into fights hardly ever i get scared leading up to things but in the actual fight [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8611.16s)]
*  itself like i'm i'm the goddamn incredible hulk you know you can't convince me otherwise in those [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8616.44s)]
*  moments well i remember one time we talked and you said that you'd made this adjustment in your head [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8622.6s)]
*  from trying to fight and win to really trying to hurt people these are you still on that same no [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8628.119999999999s)]
*  no not as much i got a little bit older one i think is a contributor to it two is that wasn't [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8635.0s)]
*  a fuel that i could hold on to for super long it was like angry fuel doesn't really like work it's [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8642.92s)]
*  not super sustainable i also found too that being that way got distracting to me being able to do [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8649.88s)]
*  what i was trying to do so any thought can be distracting when you're fighting as you know [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8656.84s)]
*  like even like silly ones or whatever but if i'm being too aggro and too i gotta hurt this guy i [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8662.599999999999s)]
*  gotta hurt this guy that was good for me to learn because i got to learn the all of the different [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8669.0s)]
*  aspects of what it means to be a fighter before that i was really zen peaceful like whatever [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8673.56s)]
*  happens happens i'm gonna do my best you know and then i went way on the other side of the spectrum [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8678.119999999999s)]
*  where it's like i'm fucking killing people and that's what i'm doing now to now kind of somewhere [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8682.359999999999s)]
*  a little bit in between where for me now all of it is about focus in doing the correct thing at [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8687.08s)]
*  the correct time i think that where i am today as a fighter is very focused on just exactly what i [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8694.76s)]
*  said where what do i need to do right now in order to win and i don't make it angry i don't make it [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8703.88s)]
*  motivated by anything else it's just no this is like a laser focused in doing the right thing [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8710.2s)]
*  and that's what i found recently has been the most helpful thing just this zen state of just [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8716.2s)]
*  existing in whatever whatever comes whatever you're supposed to be doing you do that kind of but i [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8721.800000000001s)]
*  know where i'm supposed to be now a little bit too like intensity wise before i feel like i got like [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8727.400000000001s)]
*  some like superpower that i like didn't really know how to control very much now i feel like i [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8733.480000000001s)]
*  have harnessed it and i know how to control it a lot better to where it's like okay a 10 is too much [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8739.16s)]
*  like right now we got to be a seven we're in the locker room we're about to walk out let's [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8744.84s)]
*  let's maybe be at an eight or a nine right now and and we'll be there for the fight instead of [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8749.48s)]
*  just 10 hurt the guy oh you know michael jordan had a really good quote where it was either michael [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8755.0s)]
*  or kobe but he was they said they never play a game at more than 80 and i think that that's kind [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8760.12s)]
*  of a cool way to look at it and that doesn't mean your effort i think it means your intensity level [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8766.84s)]
*  you can't think at a 10 sometimes it gets distracting to burn all of that like angry energy [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8773.08s)]
*  it's just it's just not sustainable you know so so you're in a position right now where you're [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8779.08s)]
*  next in line and when you look at marab he presents so many unique challenges like this is a [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8785.32s)]
*  he's a there's a few guys that are very skillful but they also have unique physicality [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8793.32s)]
*  and that's marab so like when when you see that fight first of all have they given you a date [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8801.24s)]
*  they haven't there i think it's one i mean that stuff takes a little bit they told me november [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8807.24s)]
*  december is when i'm looking to fight so maybe mass square garden yeah maybe which i was a little [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8811.8s)]
*  bit against too because i hate the new york state tax thing but uh but also at the same time i was [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8815.72s)]
*  in new york recently and i was like oh shit it'd be cool to win it in one of the like cool is [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8821.48s)]
*  if you won the world title in manson square garden that means a lot yeah it would mean a lot there's [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8827.8s)]
*  something about madison square garden like when you're in the building you're like man a lot of [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8833.4s)]
*  shit has gone down it's building it's huge it kind of feels like a gladiator place it's because it's [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8837.48s)]
*  just huge like the floor part is huge you know it just feels different i did stand up there and just [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8842.12s)]
*  being there and walking out to this enormous crowd in mass square garden was like whoa cool this is [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8849.56s)]
*  the fucking garden in the center of it yeah in the round oh you did it oh so you were like looking [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8855.8s)]
*  in 360 degrees did you like that's my favorite way because it's oddly intimate so even though [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8861.8s)]
*  there's 16 000 people the people on this side are seeing the people laugh on this side and everyone's [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8868.119999999999s)]
*  seeing everyone laugh and you're just walking around in a circle oh cool it's it's oddly intimate [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8873.8s)]
*  for 16 000 people it's my favorite way to do arenas i was always really curious because i've [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8878.759999999998s)]
*  seen stand-ups like that and i was like i wonder if that's distracting for them to have to yeah [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8883.4s)]
*  it's the most fun it's i thought it would be distracting too because i've done arenas where [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8887.96s)]
*  you're on stage facing the crowd and it feels oddly impersonal it's like you're just doing a show for [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8892.6s)]
*  this massive amount of people it's fun but that i kind of preferred clubs but a giant arena in the [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8898.52s)]
*  round seems like a giant club it really does it's like but there's something there's a lot of like [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8906.84s)]
*  doing it in boston was huge because like i did the td garden because that was like where i grew [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8912.36s)]
*  up and that's where i started doing stand-up but there's something about madison square garden for [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8917.640000000001s)]
*  fights where when you go there it's like there's an extra tingle in the air like who boys were at [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8923.480000000001s)]
*  the garden cool they know so you fighting maraba the garden would be fucking insane yeah it'd be [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8929.480000000001s)]
*  crazy um yeah you think about him um what do you think about this matchup like how do you approach [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8935.32s)]
*  it i think he has some um obviously really good physical traits that make him like his conditioning [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8941.32s)]
*  is a superpower that other people don't get to have and that's unique to him and he's made a way [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8948.84s)]
*  to weaponize that in a really smart way um every time i like kind of too technically break down [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8954.52s)]
*  things i feel like i'm trying to be really convincing instead of uh you know just believing [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8961.4s)]
*  in it which has always kind of been a big problem of mine in the past has always been i need evidence [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8967.48s)]
*  in order to believe in something which kind of just and like with that in in like fighting for [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8973.16s)]
*  a world champion what am i going to just walk in and be like well i've been a world champion before [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8978.359999999999s)]
*  so i could do it now like i don't get that luxury of doing that to be a world champion so recently [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8981.88s)]
*  i've had this realization of belief in self that trevor and karrington banks have both helped [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8986.68s)]
*  instill in me big time um where i feel like approaching marab is going to be [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=8993.08s)]
*  unique in its own but i don't need to tailor what it is that i'm doing too much to marab [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=9001.88s)]
*  i've really bought into this idea where if i can go out and be the best martial artist that there [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=9009.24s)]
*  is in all areas be able to wrestle with them be able to strike with them be able to grapple with [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=9015.0s)]
*  him if i can go out and trust and be that i can do it um against umar i did not as good of a job [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=9019.32s)]
*  with that i treated him like i had to change in order for me to be able to beat him against marab [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=9029.48s)]
*  i'm not going to do that i think marab also has this narrative buzz around him where he's an [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=9035.24s)]
*  unbeatable um force a freak of nature who has conditioning out of whatever and while that is [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=9040.92s)]
*  true to an extent that doesn't mean anything to the fact that the guy can't be beaten um [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=9049.64s)]
*  if i look at myself as a fighter and break myself down technically i would say [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=9055.48s)]
*  i'm i'm somewhere between umar and shawn in the task that he'll have in front of him i think i [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=9060.12s)]
*  know that i wrestle a lot better than shawn does although shawn does have really good takedown [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=9067.32s)]
*  defense his process of getting up is just like a little dated and pretty slow like you're going [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=9072.039999999999s)]
*  to lose some minutes doing it the way that omali does it um i think that i get up super good being [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=9077.32s)]

*  marab deal with me instead of me having to deal with marab do you have to do anything different [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=9129.800000000001s)]

*  run a little bit more uh um but no outside that i'll make sure that my legs are really conditioned [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKUCkIkB4Zw&t=9168.44s)]
