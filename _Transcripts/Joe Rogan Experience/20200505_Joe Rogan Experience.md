# Joe Rogan Experience #1469 - Adam Perry Lang
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 05, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EATOIfG2ISk)
*  What's happening brother, how are you?
*  Good to be here.
*  Good to have you.
*  I have enjoyed your restaurant many times.
*  This is my favorite steak restaurant in all of Los Angeles.
*  Thank you.
*  It's one of the reasons why I wanted to bring you in here because this is a really crazy
*  time for restaurants and I mean that's basically, that's the gist of it.
*  This is a crazy time.
*  It's bananas.
*  It's absolutely crazy.
*  I'm trying to just get a handle on it.
*  It's just overwhelming.
*  For me it's just head down and cook, try to help people that are in need and then we'll
*  figure it out later.
*  Well I know you've been doing a lot of cooking for first responders and for hospitals.
*  What have you been doing with your time now that this is?
*  Well it really first started where basically everybody was just staring at each other and
*  saying what is going on, what's happening.
*  I didn't lay off any of my employees and it's all happening.
*  Everybody else is closing up shop and I'm just overwhelmed as a business owner.
*  What am I going to do?
*  And actually I had my GM come up to me and because I'm trying to figure it out, everybody's
*  asked what's going to happen.
*  My GM came up to me and says hey listen, we're with you.
*  We know you didn't create the coronavirus.
*  You do what you have to do and we know your heart's in the right place.
*  I was just like, I just like kind of just let out a breath and I'm like okay well I
*  appreciate you saying that and then I was just head down, get down to business with
*  it.
*  We had a cut back, 90% of the staff and we were just like, just cook.
*  Didn't know who was going to buy it or anything.
*  It was just crazy.
*  So what did you just tell everybody?
*  The steakhouse is called APL and it's in LA.
*  What is that, like the theater district?
*  What is that called?
*  Yeah it's in the heart of Hollywood, Hollywood and Vine and it's right next to the Pentagus
*  Theater which we, what's ironic was it was literally when they closed down all the restaurants
*  was going to be the night of Hamilton premiering which is a big deal for us as a business and
*  you know all of a sudden it's like, it stops.
*  Yeah, we, I went to your place right after we saw something.
*  It was, oh it was frozen.
*  I have daughters.
*  Yeah we went to see Frozen and that was the last time I was at your place.
*  It's got to be a very strange thing.
*  This has never happened before and one of the things that we've talked about a lot on
*  this podcast is what's so devastating about this is there's a lot of people that have
*  lost businesses in the past because markets changed and because maybe they didn't do what
*  they could have done or work as hard as they could have worked but for so many small businesses
*  and restaurants and bars they've been doing the best work they've ever been able to do.
*  They're putting in the hours, they're showing up, they're putting out these amazing meals
*  and then because of nothing that's their fault it just gets shut off.
*  It just gets shut off, it's crazy.
*  And without any real understanding of how long it's going to take or when you're going
*  to, I mean we just had a conversation I was saying we should just talk about this on air
*  because we were just talking in the green room.
*  There's no clear indication of when you'll be able to go back to work and serve food
*  to the general public and what that's going to look like.
*  I know it's the unknown but how I'm investing my time, how a lot of other chef restauranteurs
*  are investing their time is trying to serve takeout to the public but also doing charitable
*  and things to provide for first line, front line, defense.
*  One of the things is Jimmy Kimmel and I teamed up for every meal that we prepare we donate
*  a meal to St. Joseph's Center.
*  So that was the first thing because our attitude was we want to help people and let them know
*  that they're cared about and then the other thing is to really just keep even just the
*  five people working because we didn't even know if people were going to order.
*  So we jumped into it like that and then these services such as Frontline LA which comes
*  in and brings, it's like the glue between us and the hospitals and we prepare meals
*  for 150 meals at a time for the hospital workers.
*  And do you guys package them up and then have them delivered to the hospital?
*  Yeah exactly.
*  I mean so we'll just sit there, they'll say hey we have a need for this particular hospital
*  Hollywood Presbyterian, okay great 150 people we package up the meals.
*  How do you do that?
*  Do they order off a menu or do you just prepare stuff that you think that they'll enjoy?
*  We prepare healthy things, things that they would appreciate and then also sometimes I
*  just serve comfort items so sometimes I'll do meatloaf gravy and mashed potatoes because
*  if they're just all healthy sometimes they just need a little bit more of like warmth
*  and like just kind of like pulling in.
*  That's a weird word comfort food.
*  It is but that's what's happening now.
*  But it works like the comfort like when you say macaroni and cheese, comfort food.
*  Yeah.
*  It is.
*  That's what people are gravitating towards.
*  That's where my menu is right now.
*  It's all comfort food and barbecue.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  So is that because that's what people are asking for?
*  Well that's probably hard to cook steaks right?
*  That's my read on the market.
*  You know I had experienced a similar thing where things shut down and people needed help
*  and that was around during 9-11 and you know our attitude was like how can we help people
*  those in need and really comfort food really kind of just blossomed out of that.
*  So when you're doing right so you're doing takeout as well and how does that work?
*  Do they order online or do they call up?
*  Like how's that working?
*  Like we prefer curbside as opposed to just doing Postmates and Grubhub.
*  You know people can do that and so we'll get people to come deliver.
*  Yeah let's get to that because how does that work Postmates and Grubhub?
*  Is that good for your business?
*  Is it less good than people ordering directly from you?
*  Like how does that work?
*  Well it's great for our business because it gives us a greater range and we really can't
*  deliver so it gives us an opportunity so it's a whole other market but you know they charge
*  a back end fee on it so we have to up charge it a bit and you know for us we'd prefer just
*  to kind of sell directly to the customer curbside which we're doing a good clip up to.
*  It's probably about half and half.
*  So like what if you had to guess like what's the capacity for your business?
*  Is it like full on wide open where people can come and sit down versus now?
*  Like how much is it deteriorated?
*  Oh it's maybe 10-15% of the business compared to.
*  So that's why I'm just focusing on like I just got to keep moving.
*  That's how I'm emotionally getting through this thing and also keeping the business going
*  is just basically just cook for people that are in need, you know focus on the hospitals
*  and then and the neighborhood just right around us so it's a tough spot.
*  And you have obviously you have a lot of friends that are in the restaurant business.
*  Oh yes.
*  We talk all the time.
*  What's the general feeling?
*  Like what is the temperature?
*  Like how's everybody dealing with this?
*  You know first of all knowing that a good number of us are not going to be around because
*  just even figuring out all the rules and the laws that are going to happen around this
*  thing are unfolding.
*  They're just very hard to read and get a clear understanding of what's happening.
*  So a lot of people just don't know the unknown.
*  You know landlords you know we're deferring rent but at the same time you know they're
*  not accepting of that.
*  So we're like on the hook and we don't even really know where we're going to end up with
*  just the PPP loans.
*  What is PPP?
*  It's the Paycheck Protection Program and that's really a government funded assistance to supply
*  restaurants and all businesses.
*  I think of all the loans given out I think only 5% of all the loans given out were actually
*  to restaurants.
*  So they give you a chunk of money essentially that covers eight weeks of payroll and also
*  a portion of that for that 75% has to be spent on payroll covers for eight weeks and
*  then the other 25% is for rent and utilities.
*  So it's like an eight week lifeline.
*  And so far how long has it been now?
*  We're looking at like six weeks of lockdown so far or something like that?
*  It feels like longer.
*  It's got to be a little bit longer.
*  Like for me it feels it probably is that I don't even have a concept of time.
*  I'm working so hard.
*  It's just me and four other people and two are in the front and two are with me in the
*  kitchen.
*  We're doing dishes.
*  We're cooking.
*  We're cleaning.
*  We're doing everything.
*  I mean it's a great sense of accomplishment.
*  I got an email from a nurse thanking us for the healthy meal that we prepared for them
*  and that makes it worth it.
*  But for me I'm actually inspired and just kicking it into high gear.
*  I'm not going to just wallow in it.
*  I'm just going to keep working, head down, do what I do and just hope at the end of the
*  day at the end of the day people have to eat.
*  So the world's going to be different.
*  Probably not going to be the same at all in terms of from my business but what choice
*  do I have?
*  Right.
*  You want one of these Ben?
*  Yeah sure.
*  Kilcliffe CBD drink.
*  Delicious.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Nice.
*  Sorry for people listening to me slurp.
*  I like that.
*  So when you're operating at 10% capacity obviously this is not sustainable.
*  10% of your business is not sustainable.
*  That's right.
*  Just because operating costs and all the above and then you're obviously in a very high profile
*  area which must be extraordinary rent too.
*  We're just not paying the rent.
*  We're just pushing it off.
*  We can't.
*  We don't have the money for it so we'll have to work it out.
*  You look very stressed out.
*  I've never seen you like this.
*  Every time I've seen you that's you right there with a big smile.
*  Whenever I see you at your restaurant it's always smiley.
*  I found out about your restaurant online.
*  It's a lot of sponsors.
*  It's just crazy.
*  I found out about your restaurant online.
*  I was just Googling new places to go for dinner and I don't know it was maybe a couple
*  years ago.
*  I was Googling steak houses and then I saw that you specialize in dry aged steaks and
*  I had a steak that you cooked once that was more than a year dry aged.
*  It was delicious but it was really weird.
*  It's weird.
*  It's different.
*  It doesn't taste anything like a regular steak.
*  It tastes like, boy it's like a different animal.
*  It's like you're eating something, some exotic animal.
*  That's what I like to do.
*  More aged doesn't necessarily mean better but it's just different.
*  For me as a chef I call my dry aged room an environmental chamber.
*  There's a picture on Instagram of me and Adam in the basement, that fucking meat locker,
*  weird meat room that you've got.
*  For people that have never been to a dry aging room it's very odd.
*  There's fans blowing around.
*  Everything's a very specific temperature.
*  You've got all these different things labeled as far as what date it was put in there.
*  For people who haven't seen dry aging it's very odd too because you're like, hey what
*  is wrong with that meat?
*  The outside crust of it.
*  Here's a photo of it.
*  Folks you can see it in the background of the, it's not working.
*  There it is.
*  So for folks who can see it in the background the meat has like a black crust to it and
*  then you slice that crust off.
*  What do you do with the crust?
*  Get rid of it.
*  But is it edible?
*  It's not enjoyable.
*  What about for dogs?
*  I wouldn't give something a dog, I wouldn't eat myself.
*  Wow.
*  Do you eat dog food?
*  What's that?
*  Do you eat dog food?
*  No.
*  Do you feed your dog dog food?
*  I don't have a dog.
*  I wish I did to be honest with you.
*  I have a dog and he eats dog food.
*  I'd love him to death.
*  But he actually eats ground elk mixed in with regular dog food.
*  Even that, I mean it gets a white ash which is almost like, I call it a, there's a friendly
*  oxidation I refer to it in the whole process.
*  Is that white ash like the same as you get on outside of salami?
*  It's like that.
*  It's part of it.
*  It's a mold.
*  And the whole concept behind dry aging is based on three things.
*  It's air velocity, temperature and humidity.
*  Air velocity.
*  Yes.
*  And it's really important.
*  I like to, you know, when I teach people about dry aging it's like if you're on a beach
*  in Jamaica and there was no wind and you just start getting sweat and you're just uncomfortable.
*  But then if trade winds went through it would have at the same temperature evaporate the
*  water off your skin.
*  So what we're trying to do is we're trying to at the right ratio evaporate the water
*  off the surface so it doesn't get like a smelly, stinky, bad mold.
*  And dehydrate it slowly.
*  What it does is it concentrates the flavor, it transforms the amino acids into a whole
*  different compound and changes the flavor altogether.
*  And then also enzymes within the meat through the process of rigor mortis.
*  It breaks down so it becomes more tender.
*  So you get flavor enhancement, you get tenderization and it just blows it away.
*  So what does it do to the amino acids?
*  It transforms it into a whole other compound.
*  It's like a flavor.
*  Have you ever heard of a concept of Maillard reaction?
*  Yes, but I don't know what it means anymore.
*  I've heard the expression but I forgot what it means.
*  Yeah, the Maillard reaction is basically like when you're cooking something what ends up
*  happening...
*  Spell it?
*  Oh god, I'm the worst speller.
*  Is it Maillard?
*  No, M-A-I-L-L-A-R-D.
*  Right, Maillard.
*  Okay, Maillard.
*  Okay, I said Maillard.
*  Okay, that's what I know is.
*  So whenever you're browning or you're doing different things at different rates, amino
*  acids transform into different things and you get different flavor compounds and that's
*  really what happens with meat.
*  So if I dry age, you have to handle dry age meat a lot differently.
*  You can't go on and say, okay, I'm going to slow cook this once it's dry age because
*  then it just develops a really nasty kind of funky flavor.
*  But if you cook it under high heat, like really aggressive, like that's why you have steakhouse
*  broilers, there's something about that browning of that dry age meat that transforms, that
*  just awakens your senses.
*  That's interesting.
*  So you don't slow cook dry age meat?
*  No, I don't.
*  It gets a livery.
*  It's almost like a livery.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  I don't even, if anybody wants dry age above medium, I try to talk them out.
*  I'll cook it any way you want.
*  But if you start cooking past medium, it's almost like seeing someone transform.
*  It just ages.
*  When you cook it a long time, it just ages and just turns into something else.
*  Those people who want well done steak are offensive.
*  You should go and eat Burger King, you monsters.
*  What's wrong with you?
*  When I go to dinner with someone, they order well done steak.
*  I just cringe.
*  I'm like, who am I eating?
*  It's a cultural thing I noticed with some people.
*  They just want to cook.
*  But if they want a well done steak, then I recommend the wet age steak to do well done
*  because at least you have a fighting chance for some type of flavor that would be appealing.
*  But it's weird.
*  Like, why are you eating steak?
*  It's true.
*  That's for me.
*  For everybody.
*  It's a criminal act.
*  You're wasting a piece of meat.
*  It's true.
*  I kind of look the other way.
*  What, do you want ketchup with that?
*  It's painful for me.
*  Some people grew up eating well done steak and that's how they like it.
*  Joey Diaz eats medium well.
*  Medium well.
*  What are you doing?
*  Why?
*  It just doesn't taste as good.
*  And it's also, there's an art to the perfect temperature, right?
*  What's the perfect internal temperature of a medium rare steak?
*  Like, what should it be, like 135 or something?
*  No, it's a bit less.
*  But it's not necessarily the temperature.
*  It's kind of like how you get there.
*  Okay, let me explain that to you.
*  So I have this method where, particularly for thicker steaks, where I'll cook it, I
*  start the cooking and then I get it to about 105 degrees and then I allow it to rest at
*  105.
*  And what ends up happening is, as I call the method, just like tempering of the meat and
*  it basically, it starts transmitting the temperature in towards the center and then I put it back
*  in again and then it'll heat up.
*  The temperature, if you like take it, I would say for medium rare, even though like on many
*  logs we'll say, okay, 120, 125 is rare, but it's not.
*  For me, if you're going to do that method, a solid medium rare will be about 120.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  So why do they think 120 is rare?
*  I don't really understand it exactly.
*  They'll get there.
*  I think they're overshooting it, particularly.
*  For me, it's not rare.
*  Like rare is 110, using the method that I use.
*  Now different people have different methods, which is really what's fascinating about cooking
*  meat.
*  I ate it a couple of times.
*  I've eaten at Bizarre Meats in Vegas, which is a fantastic restaurant.
*  Yes, fantastic.
*  Amazing chef, Los Angeles.
*  Amazing.
*  It's an amazing place too.
*  You walk in there, it's just visually it's really interesting because they have these
*  grills with live logs.
*  I mean, they take, not live, obviously, but they take logs.
*  over fire and they have these grates, these grill grates that rise and lower.
*  You can see how they're doing it when you walk in the door.
*  As you're walking to your table, you're passing by.
*  This method of, this idea of cooking over logs, like cooking over fire, some people
*  prefer that.
*  Then some people like those crazy broilers where they're gas, but the broiler, it's on
*  top and you slide the steak in and it's lowering down.
*  What is the, is there a difference and why?
*  It really comes down to what your taste preference is.
*  For me, like where I'm at right now, dry age without any type of smoke or wood is more
*  preferable because I really want to taste the dry age.
*  When you start getting into the wood fire cooking and you're burning logs that aren't
*  I like to cook basically my wood down to charcoal, like to ash so that it's cleaner.
*  Then you really taste the meat.
*  When you start burning unburned fuel, the logs themselves, it has these creosotes and
*  different flavor compounds that will get on the meat and it just, it kind of just coats
*  your palate.
*  I like that from a wet age beef, but for the dry age, I really like cleaner.
*  I like the steakhouse broiler.
*  I like using a plancha and that's just like a heated piece of steel.
*  It's like, you can do that at your home with a cast iron.
*  It's called a plancha?
*  Plancha.
*  It's just kind of like this flat sheet of steel and it's all about crust development
*  and surface contact.
*  I like to cut the steaks on a saw.
*  It's a perfect line and it's all about contact, direct with the surface.
*  It's about the browning of the meat.
*  If you're going to get in there and you're going to cook over live wood like that, he's
*  doing it obviously right because he's amazing.
*  When you raise and lower the shelf, like I was saying, how I rest it, you can start on
*  the higher level of the heat and then you bring it up higher, the actual grill higher,
*  and it's actually resting while still getting the tickle of heat up there.
*  The tickle of heat.
*  I imagine the flames won't actually touch the meat.
*  It kind of tickles it.
*  It kind of wisps at the bottom of the meat.
*  The way he's doing it at Bazaar Meats, he's using wet age steaks because that's how you
*  would cook over that kind of ...
*  I don't know if he's doing it.
*  That's my personal preference.
*  I think he does do some aging.
*  It does do some aging, I believe, over there.
*  It's just I've watched YouTube videos on how to cook the perfect steak.
*  You can watch three different videos from three different chefs and there's three different methods.
*  Same thing about dry aging though.
*  All dry aging is not created equal.
*  I call it an environmental chamber.
*  Think about it like making cheese in France.
*  You say, hey, I want a goat cheese, and you think you'd get one type of goat cheese across
*  the line.
*  I'm creating an environment just like a cheese maker that's unique to my own.
*  I actually have the culture from 15, 16 years ago that I've traveled with.
*  Hold on.
*  You put culture ...
*  Yeah, I have a method.
*  I basically take meat that has been aged and I bring those spores, if you will, from that
*  aging meat because there's a mold on it.
*  It's a friendly mold.
*  It's a friendly mold.
*  Yeah, I like it.
*  I don't want to turn people off to it because this has been ...
*  I didn't know that you brought your own mold.
*  I just figured you just let it dry age.
*  It's not as simple as that.
*  For me, it's each environment.
*  Again, I get away from ... Someone can turn around and say, my dry age is incredibly clean
*  at 100 days, 120 days because I get there slowly.
*  My temperature is very low.
*  I like to dry age at 32 to 35 degrees.
*  I like a higher humidity so I don't dehydrate the meat too soon.
*  I like 85%, sometimes a little bit lower if I want to pull.
*  It really depends.
*  I have lots of fans.
*  When you say the cult, how are you bringing this culture in?
*  How do you get it to interact with the meat?
*  I basically take ... I take pieces from the previous dry age room and I bring it to that.
*  I put it up by the fan and it will circulate spores.
*  You put it by the fan.
*  How do you do that?
*  Well, there's a fan in a cooler and it's blowing around.
*  It's blowing the ... It'll blow the spores around the room.
*  My dry age has a unique flavor.
*  I try some great guys who are like Master Revayers in the Bronx, which is ... These
*  guys are like my heroes.
*  They taught me practically dry aging.
*  They have their own flavors so their dry age tastes different.
*  Pat LaFriede is another New York guy, does amazing dry age beef as well.
*  His has a different flavor.
*  For me, that's why I take a lot of pride even though it's not the most cost effective thing
*  to carry $100,000 in inventory.
*  It gives me a unique flavor profile that is my unique selling point for my restaurant.
*  You have these pieces, those steaks that we saw in that photograph.
*  You would take one of those dry age steaks when it's ready and then you would trim the
*  pieces off.
*  Then you use those pieces, those darkened pieces, which has the spores on it.
*  How do you know how much to put in there?
*  I put in as much as I can.
*  I don't want it to clean clean in there.
*  I want it to be an environment.
*  It's like a cave.
*  I'll put a couple of trays in and then I'm very tactile.
*  I'll touch the meat and I'll feel it.
*  I'll taste it.
*  I'll see where we're at.
*  I'm always cutting into a steak.
*  When you say taste it, you cook it?
*  Yeah.
*  I'll cut off a piece.
*  How are we looking at 30 days?
*  How are we looking at 50 days?
*  Each room is different because I had a dry age room in Vegas and we had ceilings that
*  were 30, 35 feet, a lot of circulating air.
*  It had a different flavor profile.
*  We were able to age 150 days and that was our sweet spot.
*  Then here in Hollywood, it's a lot less.
*  I have a lower ceiling.
*  It circulates differently.
*  You have to really taste.
*  It's not just like, hey, I have dry age.
*  Or you go to the supermarket, it's like, oh, you sell dry age?
*  Okay, great.
*  I'll take it.
*  If you think that's what it tastes like, it's a good indicator of what it is.
*  But if you really want to get down to it, each dry age can taste a lot different.
*  That's really weird.
*  It's very experimental in a lot of ways.
*  It's constantly moving.
*  How long did it take you to dial it in?
*  When I first did it, it was really by mistake, particularly the extended age because you
*  just weren't selling the meat.
*  I had a lot of pieces left back for a long time.
*  I cut into it and I tasted it and it's like, whoa, this is incredible.
*  I was talking to the old school guys who dry age, like, oh, you're wasting your money.
*  Nobody wants steak over 42 days.
*  It's just dehydrating.
*  I was like, no, I think I'm onto something.
*  There's a big difference here in the flavor.
*  We would see a huge difference to jump in flavor and good quality, not like the funky
*  stuff like the full year.
*  That's another level.
*  It's very good though.
*  You say funky and I just want to clarify to people, it is delicious.
*  It is delicious.
*  But it's unusual.
*  It's like you're eating something from Africa, some unusual kudu meat or something like that.
*  It's true.
*  Some strange game.
*  You don't want to eat too much.
*  People want a whole steak.
*  I'm like, no, you just want two slices of it.
*  Savor it like a fine wine.
*  Understand it, get to know it, but don't like hunker down on it.
*  How come you don't want people to hunker down on it?
*  Because sometimes too much of a good thing is not good.
*  And I say the same thing also for the Japanese wagyu.
*  Like, oh, you see all that fat in the marbling.
*  It's incredibly rich.
*  And if you eat it like a westerner, it's not right.
*  It's just it's too much.
*  So certain steaks, certain types of beef, you should be eating only a small amount and
*  appreciating anything more.
*  Like you just it's just I don't know.
*  Gets me.
*  It's too much for me.
*  When did people start dry aging a year?
*  Like when when did this really because this is not something I mean, obviously, I know
*  nothing about restaurants.
*  Other than they're great.
*  But when I had heard about dry aging out here at 30 days, dry age, 60 days, dry age, I never
*  heard of a year like is this a new thing?
*  You know, they were doing it in Spain for some time, particularly with the older animals
*  like the oxen, you know, animals that are five years, eight years, ten years old.
*  And they would age these for long periods of time.
*  I was not aware of this when I started doing it.
*  But they were the first people that I heard about it was doing it while I was doing it.
*  There was amazing food writer Jeffrey Steingarten, who just like dialed into me.
*  And we did a tasting with one of my culinary heroes, Harold McGee, who wrote the incredible
*  book on food and cooking, which is a scientific manual to all chefs around.
*  He's amazing guy.
*  And he had put in his book that there's really no difference in flavor when you get to that
*  that point.
*  And so that later stage.
*  So we cook three steaks and we cut a cube out of the center of it.
*  And at that point, you know, he says, wait, maybe there is something different.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I mean, nowadays you hear more about it because we're chefs.
*  We like to play with things.
*  We like to push the limits on things.
*  But not many people want to make the commitment because it's so costly to carry the inventory.
*  And they're scared to actually do it because if you screw it up, you know, you lose all
*  the money.
*  I see more of it now.
*  But back when I was doing it, there really wasn't anybody else pushing the limits.
*  Maybe a few people.
*  I don't want to say like I was the only one, but, you know, possibly there could have been
*  a few people.
*  But, you know.
*  So it's what's interesting to me about just cuisine and cooking in general is that I didn't
*  think of it until I watched Bourdain's original show, No Reservations.
*  I didn't think of it as an art form.
*  And then when I watched the show, I was like, look how into cooking this guy is.
*  That's one of the things about people being really passionate about something.
*  It's incredibly contagious.
*  And his passion for cooking and his fascination with different methods that these masters
*  would use and the way he would just, you could see it.
*  Like he was so focused on it and so enthralled by these flavors and these creations that
*  these chefs would make that I realized like, oh, this is an art form.
*  It's just an art form that you eat.
*  But I never thought of it that way.
*  I just thought, oh, that place has delicious food.
*  This place tastes good.
*  And then you go to a really fine restaurant or a fine steakhouse like your place and you
*  go, oh, these people are, they're artists.
*  They're artists.
*  It bounces between art and craft.
*  It's like there's a moment in time when as chefs we explore it as art because you're
*  not going in with any boundaries and you're not going in and preconceived notions of what
*  it should be.
*  And that's when cooking is a true art.
*  Most of the time we're doing the craft part where we figured it out and then there's a
*  regiment of like lining it up to make sure it's consistent and we pride ourselves in
*  basically that consistency and team gathering around and doing something universal together.
*  But the art form for me is, and maintaining just being curious and inquisitive has just
*  been my bug from the day I decided to be a chef.
*  For many people like Bourdain and every other chef that I know of, that's the key that you
*  know that you'll never learn everything.
*  But you keep trying and there's just like a sea of information that's out there to explore.
*  Yeah, he would take you on these journeys to these very strange restaurants in France
*  where they're on the side of a lake and there's like 10 customers and 100 chefs working and
*  creating these things like with filet knives and a grape and like two or three caviar eggs
*  and then they give it to these people and they're in ecstasy.
*  I'm like, what?
*  This is so different.
*  I almost felt embarrassed when I first started talking to him about this.
*  You know what it's like for me?
*  Like I've been a lifelong martial artist and when some people believe ridiculous things
*  about martial arts and then you have to kind of, well that's not really how it works.
*  You have to kind of explain to them and then they see it from my perspective and they're
*  like, oh you've been doing this your whole life.
*  This is something you're deeply invested in and you're very passionate about.
*  You care very deeply about the true nature of what martial arts are.
*  Well that's how cooking is to chefs.
*  They're all very similar.
*  I know people don't like to think of martial arts as an art form.
*  They don't like to think of it as an art form because it hurts people, because it's violent
*  and violence is bad.
*  It is an art form.
*  It's just a strange one that it's beautiful to the people that appreciate it, that understand
*  how difficult it is to pull something off and what this incredible dance between these
*  people is.
*  But on the outside, like an ignorant person or a person with a very narrow minded perspective
*  would say, oh that's not an art.
*  That's violence.
*  That's terribly, was it Meryl Streep that said that?
*  Wasn't it?
*  Yeah it was.
*  It was.
*  And martial arts are not the arts.
*  Like okay lady, settle down.
*  People have their preconceived notions and I had an embarrassing preconceived notion
*  about food.
*  And I say embarrassing because-
*  It's a great analogy by the way.
*  It is in many ways.
*  And comedy is similar in that sense as well because people look at comedy like oh they're
*  just telling jokes.
*  Yes, yes they are telling jokes but the process is so labor intensive.
*  There's so much going on and I think it's like everything.
*  So many things you look at them from the outside whether it's carpentry or sculpture, you look
*  at it from the outside and if you have no experience in it, people can dismiss it and
*  they don't think of it as this passionate art form.
*  But now I have a completely different, I mean I became good friends with Bourdain and you
*  know I did his show and hung out with him a bunch of times and I got it then.
*  I'm like okay this is a different thing than I had this idea, this narrow minded idea
*  of what food is.
*  And then you get to meet other chefs and you meet all these people and you're like these
*  are these like sort of underappreciated artists that are also feeding people.
*  He had that ability.
*  He had that ability to bridge the gap and to help people understand.
*  He schooled me once and trying to understand Japanese cuisine.
*  Yeah you were telling me about that.
*  Tell me about what was that like?
*  Well I was just I was sitting there around the table.
*  I was there with him and Emeril it was after an event down in South Beach Food and Wine
*  and we're all as cooks do all at the end of an event you know we're sitting around and
*  we're just kind of reminiscing of things happening and he was there sitting next to him and someone
*  brought up the concept of you know Japanese cuisine and I just said yeah you know it's
*  so simple.
*  He just says yes but it's so complex and then I just took a step back and he just began
*  to really school me on it.
*  He just had the ability just to really communicate food and connection to community and culture
*  and that for me was a big moment.
*  Like I just got to really see him as that person directly.
*  I didn't think that sushi was very complex at all.
*  The Japanese food until I watched Jiro Dreams of Sushi.
*  I know that's it.
*  You watch that and you go oh my god.
*  I mean you just look at the fish and it just starts to curl you know it's so fresh or they
*  slap the clam and it just like curls up it's like whoa that's fresh and the pride and the
*  seasonality and I mean like what blew me away I've been to Japan a couple of times with
*  this amazing guy he's known as the Tokyo Fixer Shinji Nohara all the chefs know him.
*  If you go to Japan.
*  Tokyo Fixer?
*  He's known as a Tokyo Fixer.
*  Why is he a fixer?
*  Because he knows all the places in the books off the books if you wanted to let's say just
*  know who like produces the best tuna he'll get you to the tuna boat and he'll introduce
*  you to the guy the main guy but I mean these guys who buy the tuna for example like you're
*  seeing them at the market touching feeling but the best sushi chefs know the actual captains
*  and they know how they're handling the fish and they have a relationship that far before
*  the it actually hits the auction.
*  I mean they're in it they're they're so committed I asked him one day you know he was talking
*  about this big tuna auction that they do every year and I said why would someone pay a million
*  dollars for tuna like you know western like how do you make your money back?
*  Like no you know Japanese it's it's it's considered a you know an obligation if you can afford
*  it to actually be able to even at a loss to your customers because it's almost a duty
*  to do so and that for me is profound and that's why Japanese chefs I went there and I was
*  just like that the million dollar tuna thing was explained to me by another chef as a dick
*  waving contest he said it's essentially you're you're looking for it's it's a prestige thing
*  is a prestige yeah like that they'll show that they're spending so much money on this
*  tuna not because it's worth that no it's definitely not yeah but because that's why it's confusing
*  to people because people like how's a tuna worth a million dollars well it's not but
*  but culturally deep down inside of them it's like it's almost their duty to do it it's
*  not as if I mean it's it's definitely like you could look at as a show-off thing but
*  I mean if you really understand from like western culture but in reality there it's
*  almost like it's a pride thing it's not like hey look at me it's really more like you know
*  I'm able to provide this for my customers so it's it to me it's like it's a little
*  bit more beautiful to look at it that way right you know and and profound and like even
*  like why I got into making knives for me it's like it's everything to do with my trips to
*  Japan was because I wanted to as a chef to do everything that I can within the cycle
*  of serving the steak on the plate like up to the point where they cut the meat to to
*  you know have that control on it and then ultimately whether they like it or not that's
*  their business but at least I did everything that I could you know to control it because
*  even just how you cut the meat is has a different impact on how you would taste it yeah that's
*  one of the interesting things about your place like you make the steak knives like when they
*  serve you and they put the the forks of the knife down they tell you you know Adam Perry
*  Lang made this steak knife and I priced it at nine hundred fifty dollars and one cent
*  everybody like why so much I said it's priced to be a deterrent you know it's one cent over
*  the felony threshold and when the felony threshold it's like if you steal something
*  and the value is over nine hundred fifty dollars it's a felony so yeah so in the state of California
*  so from my perspective like I don't want to sit there you know like so you know people are idiots
*  sometimes you know they'll go into the restaurant and they'll just take stuff and they don't realize
*  what goes into it and I was like listen you know I know I'm gonna have a couple of bad apples in
*  there but the majority of people really are good people and they're not gonna steal things but a
*  good majority will take pepper mills and things I mean it infuriates us as restaurateurs so
*  that's so gross yeah oh it's terrible it's terrible like what they'll take you know meaningful stuff
*  because you know you you really want to like do nice things for your customer you catch people
*  taking pepper mills no I don't put pepper mills on the table I won't even expose myself to it
*  but for the knife though we have caught like I have one story you know only a few people have
*  attempted and I basically got to the point of like pressing charges to get the guy and but
*  instead I said I found them on you know Twitter and I messaged him I'm like listen I don't how
*  do you know who's took your knife you know we know everything and we have cameras and we have you
*  know who the reservation is under so we had cameras all over the restaurant so when we put
*  the knife down we have a whole system of like knife in knife out and this guy had slipped in
*  I'm not gonna mention his name because then the day he did the right thing but he had slipped the
*  knife into the baby carriage into his baby's car so I so I called them very calmly and I said listen
*  I don't think you realize what went into those knives I make them no response no response and
*  I remind us like it's a felony and I'm gonna give you until six o'clock today to return the
*  knife and then he realized we were serious he returned the knife and then you know now he
*  returned it personally yeah yeah yeah awkward yeah I had another guy and he returned it and he just
*  like pissed off he handed it back and he walked out the door why is he mad at you because he stole
*  something yeah that's a good it's dealing with the general public I mean in the sense this is a lot
*  like comedy clubs like most people are amazing yes and then you get a few knuckleheads they don't
*  yell out things and interrupt a show and you just try not to allow it to to penetrate you to start
*  causing you to not make nice things so your customers enjoy so you try to like block that
*  out yeah just try to give like a good experience to people the best that you can yeah that's the
*  same thing with comedy you know you want to make sure that you never have a negative feeling about
*  the audience but some people do develop that they don't understand you're it's it's almost like if
*  you read every comment on Twitter you know most people are nice yeah but it only takes 1% like I
*  was explaining to my friend Jack who was on the other day author Jack Carr and he read some
*  comments he goes now I know why you don't read the comments I'm like I told you I go listen you
*  just have to think if 1% of the people who are on my Instagram page are assholes just 1% that's
*  92,000 assholes it's insane you have to think of it that way like why would you risk your mental
*  well-being and put it in the hand of 92,000 assholes that and that's generous one out of
*  100 people if you went into a room and there's a hundred people in there what are the odds that
*  people are going to be a fucking idiot it's pretty high right well you've got to think that way
*  times three or four online because of anonymity yeah because the fact that people are you know
*  they don't think they're hurting a person when they say something mean and they look at a
*  restaurant like all these fucking guys they don't need this knife yeah tuck it or this will look
*  cool and like it's almost like there's an entitlement you know yes and all this meal was so expensive
*  yeah they mean they feel like you are doing great you've got this really nice restaurant on
*  Vine in Hollywood you must be a baller yeah they don't get it no well hopefully they'll get it if
*  they hear this yeah maybe they probably won't listening that they actually stole the knife
*  yeah right now he's like motherfucker yeah well we got me up we've gotten them back we've got
*  them back the majority of them so so there's a few out there out in the wild few out there and
*  you could buy them too right you can well you know what like I have sold it but again I price it to
*  deter right so because I only have a certain number you know I made I think I made like 320
*  on the first run and then I just made another 500 with my partner this he's a master bladesmith
*  this guy Casey London he's just you know him and I like we're head down and we can literally spend
*  12 to 14 hours just stamping an insignia into the blade and you know days upon days like thousands
*  of hours of work going to these things and who else does that is there any other chefs that make
*  their own knives not that I really know you got that market cornered I guess so I guess so you
*  know how did you get involved in that like it was that something you thought like hey this would be
*  a great additional touch or were you always fascinated with knife making well I was I've always been
*  fascinated by knives because you know knives to a chef or an extension of themselves so you can judge
*  like a chef just basically on how sharp then and how they maintain their knives in terms of what
*  type of quality of output they're actually going to do it's a sense of pride like so if you're just
*  a home someone who has a garden and grows a tomato you know but you're gonna take that first tomato
*  you think you're just gonna grab any knife from the drawer you're gonna get your sharpest knife
*  and you're gonna slice into it so like everything we do it's like if you're seriously committed to
*  the craft it's like you want to make sure your tools are top-notch and for me I've always you
*  know always had a knife in my hand but when I sold my business in London you know I wanted to just
*  take some time and I got into this concept of wanting just to go that next step that next level
*  and I was fascinated with steel so I went to the New England School of Metalwork and I started
*  first we learned how to make steel from iron and then went through the whole process. How long did that take?
*  They have these great courses you know week two weeks three weeks at a pop so you know it's about
*  a year flying back and forth to Maine to attend the school and then that community is like I
*  remember our restaurant community before Food Network got involved and you know it's all about
*  craft and sharing information so you can go to these things called hammer ins where around the
*  country there'll be an ensemble of maybe like nine to ten you know master smiths who will show like
*  okay handle making or you know making a dagger or tempering steel you know in a certain way and you
*  know you learn and I just became fascinated with it just to actually just use a power hammer with a
*  five thousand pound anvil and like thin out steel and it's just like it's it just puts adrenaline
*  through you it's like physical like making something and then knowing that you're making
*  something that will last generations if it's maintained I mean that's powerful stuff. You
*  want to see something cool on the other table that's a samurai sword from the 1500s.
*  Yeah hold on a second. You need to see this. I do need to see this. I'm into this. Oh my gosh.
*  Can I take a look? Yeah pull it out. Don't cut anybody. That's a legit samurai sword.
*  Wow. With papers and everything. With the stingray. Yeah I don't I don't know whether the scabbard is
*  original but the steel the actual steel is original I'm sure it's been rewrapped. Can you imagine that?
*  Now look at this steel. I mean this steel is like it's 500 years old. That's what's crazy. And that's
*  the profound thing. I mean there's something about making something that would last like that. I mean
*  yeah. No it's amazing. It's an amazing thing to just to have around and when you pick it up and
*  hold it it's got weight to it but it's it's it's delicate in the sense that it's it's thin and
*  elegant but yet. Can you see the curve in the blade like that? And you know what's amazing about
*  this is that when they do the quench in other words when they're actually putting the soul of
*  the blade into it. What does that mean? The heat treatment. So you know anybody can like pound out
*  and make a shape well not anybody but pretty much anybody who's handy with you know making things
*  can make what looks like a blade but the true soul of the blade comes through the thermal cycle the
*  heat treatment. That's why you know people like oh Japanese steel is the best or German steel is
*  the best because there's this whole process that is about aligning the molecular structure and the
*  right type of stack and the type of steel that you do and then hardening it or or softening it. So
*  if you want a softer blade or you know that might be more utility and or you want a harder blade
*  that might be more brittle but can get really razor sharp. That's what determines what the blade
*  is and what it will be and it's that soul of the blade that like something like this. So this curve
*  is actually produced by the quench so after you go through this process you heat it up and you
*  put it into the the water it actually it just bows up and actually creates its curve and evenly too
*  which is incredible. That's why these guys are to me the epitome of like masters these craftsmen that
*  make knives and blades. Well there's always the dopest scenes in movies where someone's making a
*  samurai sword when they're about to go out and kill somebody with it. This is the thing is the
*  guy goes to the knife master or the the sword master and he's pounding on it and the the red hot
*  steel and dunk it into the fire. They want you know I went I wanted to get a blade made for me in Japan
*  and I went to this amazing place corn trading in New York and the owner she came to me and she says
*  well the knife maker would like to have a picture of you while they're making the blade and at that
*  time I was like whoa this is this before I was making that. So he wants to look at you while he's making it?
*  Yeah for some reason I said wow that's pretty profound you know it's like okay you know puts
*  your soul your character into the blade so. So he wants to think of you as he's making the thing.
*  I guess so. That's cool. For me it was pretty incredible this is amazing. Yeah let me get it out
*  here before something spills on it. Yeah I always people take pictures with this and I'll have you
*  take a picture with it. Yeah at the end of the whoa whoa whoa that's why. There we go.
*  You got so much cool stuff around too much this fucking desk is a mess. I'm cleaning it up today.
*  After this podcast I've decided I gotta take uh Donnell Rawlings black ash candle off. I love you
*  Donnell but I'm not into this smell every day. But um I wanted to get back to something you said
*  earlier you said the way restaurants were before the Food Network. Yeah. Like what happened?
*  You know I think Food Network and and food shows in general are a great thing you know it empowers
*  people to cook and there's all different levels and I think it's the the greatest thing and also
*  has given us as chefs a platform to do some incredible things too. But there was a different
*  type of motivation between between the cooks in the kitchen and a good number of the cooks today.
*  So before you know there wasn't celebrity um involved so you were there for the reason for
*  the love the art of it. Where as nowadays I'm not going to say everybody because I cook with and I
*  know there's plenty of people that are very serious about it. It's about about the craft of
*  putting in the hours the repetition that doesn't make sense until all of a sudden you're doing
*  something without thinking about it. And that's what it was like really before. Um we were just
*  everybody was in the kitchen was there because they loved cooking not not for any reason of celebrity
*  or or whatever it is. So it it really it did change good you know patience like so people
*  like the the progression would be like oh you work as a line cook for three to four years and then
*  you know you're then you're a sous chef for a number of years and then you're a chef and you
*  know there was a progression and then when the whole thing came along then it was everybody was
*  like from culinary school to chef you know they wanted to jump right into it. And are do you think
*  there's a significant number of people that are actually getting into cooking to become famous?
*  There's something about it yeah there's an allure I mean it that it has a it has a thing I don't know
*  not the term famous is a little bit different I'd say like notoriety in other words they're like
*  ready to show like hey I can do this but with cooking there's a certain number of hours you
*  just you cannot avoid you have to put this in you have to have the knife in that in your hand for
*  thousands and thousands of hours before you really are starting to cook because it's easy to do a
*  dish but it's difficult to do a dish and to cook you know consistently with all the different
*  things getting thrown at you like this coronavirus thing and like okay how do you adapt how are you
*  resilient you know how can you bounce back how do you understand like no matter what I'm going
*  to get this dish up at nine o'clock if that customer wants it at nine o'clock not anything
*  else I mean there's so the more that you can get in terms of your toolbox in terms of the use of
*  the knife I mean cooking I don't think about cooking when I'm doing it it's just only when I
*  step back and reflect and I want to teach somebody I say oh yeah I do that oh I didn't notice that
*  because all of a sudden your hands start moving and because all about heat so you're like oh I've
*  heat on the side of the grill I know it's not on the grill grates but I'm going to use it to cook
*  the side of the steak I'm going to push it up against there how often do you teach people
*  anytime but somebody asks I love teaching it I mean for me I love to share my knowledge and I
*  mean I'm at a stage where you know it's like martial arts so I did a keto for a while and
*  what was amazing to me was the learning process for the black belt so your white belt basically
*  into your black belt pretty much I know there's a brown belt in there but you know when you're
*  training is you know by teaching and explaining and slowing down you get to reinvent not reinvent
*  you get to reacquaint yourself with something that is so familiar so that movement might be
*  functional but now you're you're seeing someone else doing it like it causes you to rethink it
*  so when I'm teaching somebody I'm actually learning yeah that happens that's a big part of
*  this process that happens in jujitsu when people start teaching and I've seen I've never taught
*  jujitsu but I've seen it from a lot of my friends that have become teachers all of a sudden their
*  level jumps way up and there's the only thing that could be attributed to is that they're teaching
*  people so because they're teaching people they're going over the fine details that you would
*  ordinarily you just kind of have it in your head like you know when you pass the guard you put your
*  knee here you put your foot there it's normal you do it all the time but then when you're teaching
*  someone it solidifies the important points and almost all the great jujitsu practitioners are
*  also great teachers that's it's key yeah I totally relate to that correlation you know for me
*  you know it gets you to really like dial in on the minutiae of details and perfect yourself
*  well not perfect you but strive towards perfection the craft of cooking yeah after cooking and again
*  there's probably a dozen or more different styles right like everyone's got their own way to sort of
*  prepare things and do things there's definitely a core like you'll have different schools of how you
*  approach things like you say hey one guy does it this way one guy does it that way but I think the
*  best thing that you can say is that you know you know I like I think about it like hey you have a
*  golf bag and you have all these different irons and woods and all these different things in there
*  it's like what you know the circumstance the environment it's going to dictate how you cook
*  not say hey I'm going to cook that steak and I'm going to use a cast iron pan it's like well I don't
*  have a cast iron pan so what are you going to do is like well I'm going to cook and I grill it's like
*  you don't have a grill just like okay um what do I have it's like you have this this and this
*  that's you know so I only have this shitty you know steel pan here and doing like this and
*  you know you take a look at it and you're like you adapt you know I guess that's a steel steel
*  pan shitty no no it's great okay he said like I'm just saying like the steel pans are great blue
*  steel you know I use that all the time in the kitchen um you know I like cast iron just in
*  terms of the the heat recovery that it has um what does that mean when you have a cast iron pan so you
*  you heat it's like it's slow to heat up but then once it gets to that level if I was to put like a
*  cold steak in it the cold steak on a different type of pan would bring the temperature of the
*  steel down and then it has to heat back up and then by that time water can start to develop
*  like underneath the steak and then it starts boiling or steaming and that's why you can't
*  get a crust when you put in a steak into a cast iron pan for example and you do a planche or
*  whatever the rate the rate at which water is repelled is it basically it steams or it goes
*  away from the meat it's actually and so as a result it then starts the browning okay and
*  transforming the flavor rather than it boiling because if you tasted a boiled piece of meat versus
*  a piece of meat with the crust you'd say the piece of meat with the crust is a lot better
*  you know so there's something about it so the cast iron pan is basically when you put the steak in
*  the temperature is it's not even going to be moved because that's it's like a freight train
*  it's just moving you know it's going to keep going but something like a thinner steel pan
*  if you put something big and cold into it it's going to drop the temperature of the steel and
*  then it has to recover not only with the steel but the mass of let's say a thick steak so it's
*  got to compensate that's really why now i have a carbon steel pan that i sear steaks on all the
*  time most of the time the way i cook is i use a traeger grill and i cook it very slow so i'll do
*  it at 225 degrees and i do it until i hit an internal temperature about 125 and then i sear
*  the outside that's been the method that i use well i'm going to just share my knowledge with you so
*  i you know with cooking steaks the term sear doesn't really um it's it's a misnomer there's
*  only browning because like searing really only can happen when you know you have live flesh so to
*  speak so it doesn't actually happen like where it sears in or seals in juices what about like
*  ahi tuna when they sear that well it's technically it's more like browning um okay i mean i'm just
*  it's just like it's a terminology it's a terminology it's like keep searing i'm not telling you not to
*  think no i understand what you're saying the concept is this it's browning it's not searing so um uh
*  bring me back on track low temperature okay so for example what i would tweak with you is like i
*  would say go to 265 you're gonna have the same results in a quicker period of time with the same
*  tenderness um that ratio of speed is not going to impact um your product so at the end of the day
*  225 everybody says slow and low but i'd say a lot of times like a bit hotter and a bit quicker is
*  actually better for the crust development and also for the meat because for the tenderness of the
*  meat let's say you have a thick like like a brisket and it's got all these all this collagen in it
*  which is tightly wound protein i think about it as like a sponge that's dehydrated when you throw
*  it on top of the water it kind of floats and then all of a sudden it catches and then soaks up the
*  juice so when you're putting it in at that lower temperature you're heating it up you're causing
*  the protein to squeeze out the liquid and then if you're doing at the rate ratio it's drinking
*  the liquid into the collagen to turn into gelatin which is that unctuous beautiful mouthfeel that
*  you'll get from a long cooked piece of meat okay now if you get a long cooked piece of meat like
*  a really well done brisket what temperature you cooking that at um depending on the cooker that
*  i'm using but 265 is my is my like typical dial in so 265 you don't you ever go lower than that
*  for anything i can if i want to get sleep it's depending on my schedule in other words like
*  i'm going to get relatively the same results but less crust development from 225 depending on how
*  i handle it again there's like lots of little variables so but um by 265 i found that for
*  brisket for example it's the right ratio of that collagen drinking it up to get the gelatin and
*  also the right crust development the a lot of what i cook is wild game like most of it so which is a
*  lot leaner yeah and um and so that's why i would go a little bit hotter um try it the next time
*  got nothing so 265 go 265 okay and then how do you feel about that method of cooking it slowly then
*  browning the outside later i don't i'm not a big fan of it because you know there's all these
*  different compounds that are full you know it's not like i mean they call it like a reverse here
*  yeah that's like the terminology right for me there's nothing like a crust that is created
*  because what ends up happening is it's like you know if you're cooking it slow all these juices
*  start to get pulled out okay and they disappear that like their juice on the bag and make it into
*  a sauce or it gets evaporated into the air the thing about doing that is is like if you're
*  putting it directly in the pan while it's wet all those juices are bouncing back and then re-adhering
*  to the meat okay that's flavor that's flavor you you would lose normally now the sacrifices like
*  sure you'll get it cooked from end to end perfect okay so it'll be pink to pink okay it's great
*  right but if you go back and you know sear it or brown it after you miss out on all these
*  compounds and it's not the same crust i i bet you if i gave you a blind taste test using the
*  both methods you would appreciate the other crust over the reverse here and this is even with wild
*  game even with a very lean meat that's a different story that's what i cooked though okay um that's a
*  different story so with the lean meat um i would probably say to brown it first and then go slow
*  the reverse because there is a gentle there is a gentle way of of like it's so lean you want to
*  kind of like slide into home i kind of say is like you develop a certain amount of momentum
*  and for the leaner meats it's about the rest so you're cooking it and then you're taking it out
*  and then you're allowing that heat momentum to kind of carry over now i gave you a bunch of
*  elk meat how did you cook it um a lot of it just like hot and fast so i can really taste it you
*  know i don't mind a bit of a chew most people are different you know for me i want to taste the meat
*  i want to savor like the juices of what that is and elk's my favorite thank you for that i mean
*  i'm still i still have some of it it's fantastic i got more if you want more oh i'll take it all
*  right that's the best well i want to try some of the way you cook it i want i want to have you
*  cook some of that elk i'd love to do that yeah we're gonna make that happen one of these days
*  i'd love to see your method and what the difference is um i learned how to do it from chad ward he's a
*  world champion barbecue guy uh whiskey bent barbecue on uh instagram whiskey is it bbq whiskey bent
*  bbq i think uh chad's a great guy and uh i've been with him in camp on several hunting trips where
*  he's cooked for uh traeger like traeger will hire him to come and cook for us and it's incredible
*  and this that's the method method that i learned from him is that that reverse your method yeah
*  it's incredible i mean you can go to all different chefs and they'll get to the same place taking
*  different paths and they'll get there for me it's like fishing you know it's like which fly like
*  you know which fly do you choose like fine you know whatever the hatches but it's oftentimes
*  it's the fly that you believe in most that is going to catch the fish i mean okay i'm drawing
*  a terrible analogy here i know what you're saying but confidence you're having it right
*  confidence you're going to fish it harder you're going to believe in it and you know you embrace
*  it and a lot of that has to do with success in cooking you know you have to believe in what
*  you're doing there's some obviously there's some metrics involved but a master like that guy for
*  example um i can't refute at the end of the day it's fantastic i get there a different way you
*  know maybe there's subtle differences maybe mine's better maybe it's not i don't even think better is
*  the way to that's right put it exactly they're they're different and what what what do you
*  prefer and what do you how you feel about sous-vide um i think it has its place but it's not the answer
*  you know for me um you know certain types of proteins like shellfish it's it's a godsend
*  shellfish yes lobster tails or shrimp or anything like that because the protein there it's so
*  delicate and if you can go slow like thomas keller has a fantastic recipe butter poaching lobster tails
*  in sous-vide and it just cooks it so that it's super tender and it's not tough and then afterwards
*  vacuum seal it with the butter with the butter and some aromatics i want to cook that right now
*  that sounds incredible they take it out you can kind of like toast it on the grill lightly or put
*  in a pan it's something else yeah um my friend forest go forest galante he's a biologist and he
*  goes uh off of um santa barbara he goes out there and and and catches him and he gave me so you've
*  never done it with the butter and the no no never done it i'm gonna it's gonna change yeah i've only
*  done it um on a grill i've only done it when it was delicious i cooked he gave me four lobster tails
*  that he captured himself yeah they were delicious but i cooked them on a grill i just followed a
*  recipe that i found and with butter and paprika and a couple different things yeah garlic next
*  time put that in the bag seal it follow follow the time sequence take it out and then kiss it on the
*  grill you're gonna so what other shellfish is good is scallops good scallops is good good with with
*  sous-vide but you know for me scallops i mean particularly if they're fresh i mean i'd rather
*  kind of just cook them in a pan um there's something about that particular the cell
*  structure and the scallop that i want just you know charred in a pan and still just like almost
*  like a bit raw there's a sweet spot with scallops yeah there's such a sweet spot and and once you
*  cross the line yeah they get tough and weird you kind of ruin it yeah it's terrible how do you know
*  when they're ready um well for me it's a feel um and you know you want to kind of feel it so that
*  you know when you touch it um it doesn't feel raw but it starts to give it a slight spring
*  and then you pull it and then like i said earlier it's like you kind of like slide into home you let
*  that residual heat and that temperature kind of slow down a lot of times if you're going a bit
*  fast you take it and they have like some cold melted butter not too cold still a bit liquid
*  and you cook it and then you just dunk it right into the butter and it just arrests the cooking
*  and then you have it there and like then the guests come and then all you have to do is just
*  like heat it up a little bit and then it goes oh so complicated it's not though i'm sure but i mean
*  it's like you got to dial it in you know it's it depends on what you want you know the end result
*  so like you know you have guests coming over you want to enjoy your time with them you know you
*  figure out little tricks what you can get away with and what you can do so my friend tom popo
*  he met earlier who's getting tested for covid along with you when he uh has been in here before
*  he brings this homemade sourdough bread that's just sensational i'm not a bread guy i don't
*  eat a lot of bread i eat very little of it in fact especially now but when i eat his like my god it's
*  so good and he's he keeps saying i'm getting better every time i do it i'm like it's fucking
*  bread no are you getting better no he's getting better it's crazy i'm just being an asshole i know
*  but he's my friend i'm just fucking around but he's he it's similar in a lot of ways to your dry
*  aging too because he has this starter which is a living thing yeah it's and you know his starter is
*  i don't know how many years old it's old as fuck though but he's been using this same starter that
*  he got from somebody else and just it brings soul to it it brings soul to the food yeah for me and
*  that and that connection that you have to the food is going to also you know make you care about it
*  more while you cook it and you know it's not just a commodity where like okay what are me 16 steaks
*  in a box you know and bring it in i mean you can push out food like that there's a place like
*  there's a place for that in this world well what i'm really hoping really hoping is that some sort
*  of a rapid test for covid not even like the 15 minute one that we came because i heard something
*  about some saliva tests that they're trying to develop that's extremely rapid that would be
*  amazing if you could just test people right before they come into your restaurant no one
*  has to worry about shit yeah you know gearing up for what it's what the new world is going to be
*  yeah temperature you know everybody gets their temperature taken you know but that's not good
*  enough see the temperature thing is not good enough because if you're asymptomatic but you're
*  still spreading it like why are we pretending like you that's avoiding science we need to find out
*  whether or not people actually have it this temperature thing is just whether or not you're
*  sick i know it doesn't mean you don't have it if you're if your temperature is low it's it's real
*  weird and that's what's being that's what's going to be mandated on us i mean there's a certain
*  series of things that we're gonna have to do and it's you know nobody knows for sure or whatnot but
*  you know who knows well at a certain point in time i think we really need to make a decision as to
*  whether or not we're just gonna allow this to take over our world or whether we're going to
*  do what we can do to protect the sick you know if you're in contact with people that have
*  a weakened immune system you're gonna have to have a different life than someone who doesn't if
*  you're a person with a weakened immune system you're gonna have a different life if you're an older
*  person you're gonna have to have a different life but for the vast majority of us this this we're
*  gonna have to give people the freedom to make choices and to to do what they want to do with
*  their own life and their own health if you're giving people the freedom to eat terrible food
*  like heart attacks are killing people as quickly as anything right cancer is killing people as
*  quick as anything cigarettes kill a half a million people a year there's no government mandate that's
*  trying to get people to stop smoking cigarettes in fact there's not a single word ever spoken
*  about it in presidential can campaigns and governor governor campaigns congressional campaigns no one's
*  out there trying to get people to stop smoking cigarettes but yet it's killing a half a million
*  people every year in this country alone we're so strange in and i understand cigarettes is a choice
*  and infectious diseases are not we're worried about protecting people who have these compromised
*  immune systems but it's not most people you know the the vast majority of people that are going to
*  get this are not it's not going to be fatal we have to figure out how to protect the people that
*  are high risk but to quarantine the whole country it just seems like maybe it was a good move to do
*  initially but we can't sustain that so now we have to figure out how to move forward and there's all
*  these protests all over california now i'm sure you've seen it in orange county and the sentin
*  huntington beach and there's counties in northern california that are like we're opening up everything
*  we're going to open up restaurants we're opening up bars we're going back to business texas is
*  basically back to business montana is doing the same and you know they have a a modified approach
*  to dealing this and we're going to have to figure it out on the long way but i just don't want us to
*  lose i i know i don't want to lose any people but i certainly don't want us to lose restaurants
*  either i don't want us to lose bars i don't want us to lose comedy clubs i don't want us to lose
*  small businesses that are crippled by this is going to look like i mean here we are like you know you
*  talk about a comedy club like how do you even like okay six feet apart and then doesn't make
*  sense there's a certain energy in the room like what type of world do we have you know in front
*  of us the way it's slated right now right and you know what kind of government overreach are we going
*  to have where people are going to come in and police this you know like what i mean there's
*  no real science to that either by the way you know they have a bunch of people jammed into a room
*  whether six feet apart or not you're touching things you're breathing on each other i mean i
*  don't i don't know i i think you should allow people to do what they want to do you know if
*  it gets to a certain point where we have some sort of a viable cure or a treatment like there's this
*  um what is that stuff called again this anti-viral medication that dr fauci has been remdesivir
*  yeah remdesivir the hey say i mean boy we're hoping for that right we're hoping that there's
*  some sort of a treatment where it's not a death sentence for people even with immune compromised
*  systems so i mean i just uh i feel so bad for people like you and for all the people out there
*  that own these amazing restaurants that it's one of my favorite things to do is to go to a nice
*  restaurant and it would be for me to go to work yes it'd be such a shame if because of this
*  this pandemic all that goes away i mean and what kind of a build-up are we looking at to try to
*  bring those places back yeah i you know i don't have the answers you know for me um you know what
*  can be done if you had a magic wand what would you do if someone said adam fix this
*  it's difficult for me because you know i hear your point but i have just such great empathy for you
*  know people that would get sick just by someone else's negligence and and for me so that it's a
*  bit of a tussle here because you know i want to just you know on one hand you have like an economy
*  that is just tanking and businesses that are going to go out of you know business but then on
*  the other hand you know you have people that are defenseless um some people that look healthy
*  fantastic you know like a friend 45 years old goes in and they're on a ventilator and it's just like
*  you can't give the answers right i don't know if i'm even prepared to give you a summary on it i i
*  haven't formulated in my brain the way that i've just been coping and that's all i'm just trying
*  to hold on um and you know for me i'm just trying to put faith in the fact that people have to eat
*  and people like you really want to have restaurants around and in the end we're going to find our way
*  and the only way i know to get through this is just to head down and work and be really helpful
*  to people that are in need and be there for the community and feed them but outside of that you
*  know i i don't know god like if i had the i i don't know how to answer you yeah nobody knows
*  that's what's crazy even if i was in control i mean you know because i i don't want people to die
*  unnecessarily by people's negligence but on the other hand uh i just don't know well it's such an
*  incredibly messy situation with no clear-cut answer because of the fact that you do have these
*  people that are seemingly healthy 35 year old people that are getting it and dying and it doesn't
*  make sense and then you have you know you hear oh guy world war ii veteran 102 years old beats
*  covid yeah you know like you see that too so it's like what how do i think about this do i think
*  about it like the common cold do i think about it like the flu do i think about it like some new
*  thing that we i mean everyone is unsure and that's what makes it so strange to get the vaccine you
*  know a vaccine as quick as possible you know so that we can get it you know um at least have some
*  type of defense for this because and i don't know how long that's going to take people like are
*  talking a ridiculous amount of time but well it takes a long time to develop a vaccine correctly
*  i mean they're going through a bunch of trials right now we've talked about it before there's
*  several ongoing including ones with uh human beings that they're testing the vaccine on there
*  was a woman in seattle she was the first ever uh person to receive this coronavirus vaccine there
*  they did a story on her and they're monitoring her you know what does because that's the only
*  way for us to be sure i mean because responsibly i mean even just people coming into the restaurant
*  like don't get me wrong i want the business and i want to have a bar that's bustling i want to have
*  a vibe i want people to be happy well fed enjoy themselves but you know right not be nervous not
*  be nervous someone coughs and everybody freaks out yeah servers have the mask on so now all of a
*  sudden we can't have music because people can't hear the server and there's you know yeah yeah
*  nobody used to give a shit they would shake hands it's weird you see people shake hands in a movie
*  now and you're like oh what are you doing i know it's you can just get twitchy about it yeah so
*  it happens so quickly too that's what's weird like the whole world shifted so rapidly and um
*  people like you are the ones i mean obviously the people that get hit the hardest of the people
*  a with the disease and b that work with people with the disease right the people that are
*  that have the disease and then the the first responders and hospital workers and and all the
*  different people that work to help those people they're they're the most devastated by this but
*  there are so many small businesses right now that are in this position that you're in where there's
*  so much uncertainty is the key is going to be the rent game i mean at the end of the day um for a
*  lot of these business that's the looming factor is is being on on the hook you know not not only
*  just to make rent the following month with a compromised uh um you know 50 occupancy you know
*  if you can imagine you know if you're paying rent for that you know you have a model in terms of how
*  much income you know someone brought out the the the possibility of like instead of you know
*  forgiving the rent taking the rent and putting it on the back end of it so right now essentially
*  the for the three months you're not you don't need to pay the rent but you'll be add on three
*  months to the end of your lease you know that for me makes sense but for us to turn around and you
*  know work at you know 10 15 capacity and then all of a sudden get a bill for six figures say okay you
*  owe this so who's gonna who's gonna fill my shoes like so if i can't make it at my location who's
*  gonna come along and take on that rent anyway nobody's gonna do it so they're stuck we're stuck
*  what are we gonna do right it's almost like the deficit that gets established is insurmountable
*  for someone to come on and start from scratch like how much i mean you started that restaurant
*  how long ago we have a two-year anniversary and i guess it's in four days so i must have found out
*  about it right after you open yeah um how long did it take to prepare to open up that restaurant
*  god if you want to include looking for a space and trying to find the right location it's a couple
*  years so a couple years of preparation and then how long does it take to actually develop the space
*  and set it up correctly what was it before you guys were there it was an empty space i mean it
*  was a project you know built from scratch so you know going through just the permitting process in
*  la and just going through everything it you know you have to hire so many consultants and people in
*  between to get things through it's a lot different than new york so i mean for us we were delayed
*  like every project is delayed i mean it took us over a year to build it out um and you know you
*  just like let's open already because each day that passes you know you're losing money and when you
*  do something like this like were you working as a chef in another place while you were doing this
*  no i was just basically living off of the proceeds from the the sale of my business that i had in
*  in in london and other other projects and you just kind of like as an entrepreneur you know
*  you're just putting it into the restaurant hoping it opens as quick as you can and then you know you
*  kind of then you have your cash flow you know that's the fucking opening up a business like that must
*  be so insanely stressful yeah because you know especially you know not inheriting an existing
*  restaurant like for me is like wow i really believe in the area i love hollywood and vine it
*  gave gave me like certain activity in the area gave me like a new york vibe i really love the energy
*  um yeah so i looked at historic building it was built in 1923 it was la's first skyscraper you
*  know it's a whole story like as chefs and restaurant chores we get romantic about we get connected to
*  the story to to what it is and sometimes it overrides the sensibility of um you know building it
*  out but you know you invest in it and and you want it to work out and it's it works out it's great
*  but it's a lot of work and it's a long road to get there that whole area seemed before this like
*  it was experiencing a resurgence like it was like super shady just about 10 years ago yeah um a lot
*  of development you know i think that over the course of like the past like within five years
*  and two years like six billion in development of buildings and hotels and there's a revitalization
*  project that's taking place on hollywood boulevard that's going to extend the sidewalks
*  and make it almost promenade like and you know i think that you know if any place in la should
*  be that kind of place it should be there i mean i saw the revitalization in time square for example
*  you know as a kid like don't walk down the street and don't go there and now it's disney you know
*  it's it's a whole nother world it's so weird there now well now it's really weird but before
*  the pandemic it was it's like it became a mall became a mall it's crazy and you know it was the
*  dirtiest place in all of new york it was horrible i've only been there a couple of times back in the
*  day back in the 90s before it got cleaned up but i remember it was not a place i wanted to stop
*  yeah 70s and 80s like i remember my dad like sitting down and was like okay you don't walk
*  down the street and you know you always look as if you know you're carrying something you know like
*  you always look like you walk like as if you're carrying a knife or something this is a 12 13
*  year old kid you know oh my god what is how do you walk like you carry a knife really confident
*  like that you can handle yourself and you know and not you know not look like a victim remember
*  the thing they would do in the movies where a guy would pretend to have a knife or pretend to have
*  right right pocket over a scarf over a scarf yeah nobody does that anymore right like to have the
*  gun in the pocket move that was that sort of that went away with quicksand yeah people started
*  talking about those things um when you first came out here was that the first place that you opened
*  have you have you had a restaurant in la before no i did i did a series of pop-ups so for me you
*  know um there was a huge lot by uh jimmy kimmel's show and i basically took a 5 000 square foot
*  space and i built it out i have you know a whole barbecue trailer on a tractor trailer so i have a
*  thousand gallon propane tank that was custom welded by erin franklin in austin he's amazing
*  one of the top franklin's barbecue yeah yeah top barbecue top top fabric he's got some great
*  youtube videos oh he's he's tremendous and you know aside from like the videos in terms of teaching
*  people he's just a great down-to-earth guy he's fantastic seems like it yeah he's tremendous so
*  i just created just kind of like a um an homage to to barbecue um to doing it right i had a little
*  airstream i slept in the parking lot cooking it overnight served only lunch you know everybody got
*  the same thing so i did that for about four years before i opened up the restaurant how do you know
*  jimmy um i did a show back in 2008 we hit it off right away and uh you know after the show like hey
*  you want a barbecue so then we ended up hanging out the weekend and he's into fly fishing you know
*  we're into like the same into the same stuff we just became great friends so you actually are into
*  fly fishing so you're talking about it not just as an analogy oh i'm obsessed with it really oh
*  where do you go obsessed with it oh anywhere and anywhere but like a majority of the places places
*  that i love in idaho montana wyoming are you one of those catch and release guys absolutely 100
*  how weird is that though it's not if you look at it as as just a system and environment you know
*  you know we talk about this process thing is like fly fishing like it's the one thing you can invest
*  your time in and you can do into a very old age like so if you're lifting weights you know there's
*  a certain point where you know you're just gonna you know stop but like fly fishing can really
*  invest your time into and there's just something about all the different facets of it that are
*  absolutely amazing so um gosh i lost my track i'm thinking about it well i did a lot of fly fishing
*  when i was a kid oh really yeah where did you go boston i mostly did it on ponds and lakes so like
*  large mouth bass and stuff yeah i did a lot of fishing but i did a lot of fly fishing how much
*  better is though is the take on a popper on a fly rod of a large mouth bass you know it's fun um but
*  i also like top water baits you know with a casting rod and casting reel like spinning tackle i like
*  a lot of different fishing but uh fly fishing is for people who think fishing is too easy they want
*  like no this you know okay this is what you had asked me to say the catch and release thing so
*  it's kind of like creating a sustainable culture an environment that gets passed on for generations
*  because there's so much more than just catching the fish it's that moment in time when you
*  completely block out you turn your phones off or most of the time you're out of range you're with
*  a fishing buddy and you're almost like parallel playing and you're sitting there and you're just
*  you're just you focus on a certain riff in the water and you start casting to it and you start
*  figuring out what's going on and there's just some real beauty in the whole process of it that
*  to me it's like shooting elk with a suction cup at the end of the arrow
*  like i got him he's running off like the suction cup arrow that's going to drop off and he's going
*  to be unharmed um it's just weird i have done catch and release before i just just state that but
*  when i think about it when i spend time alone thinking about it i'm like why am i doing this
*  i'm putting a hook through this fucking fish's head why don't just leave that poor fish alone
*  unless i want to eat them like i like catching fish and then eating them yeah that's that's my
*  favorite thing to do so maybe i should just stick to that well maybe i mean you know for me like
*  trout it doesn't really eat that well there's so many other what doesn't eat well trout doesn't
*  how dare you it doesn't who are you compare compare you're a chef yeah no it's true how can
*  you say such a thing don't you think there's a method to cook trout perfectly where it's
*  delicious i've had trout in restaurants before and it was excellent i'm not saying it's not
*  delicious but i am saying that there's so many other fish out there that are better that i
*  better and most of the fish i like to eat more rare and raw you know for me like that's more
*  flavor but but the trout for me i don't know like at this point it's like a sacrilege to kill kill
*  a trout i mean i just identify with it just the whole process but well trout tastes better than
*  oh yeah and i've released i've caught and released large mouth bass before yeah yeah yeah because
*  they're in a pond and it's the stagnant water it's swampy you know i've tasted them it is weird that
*  you know that is a that is a factor the swampy because uh small mouth bass i've eaten it tastes
*  much better oh yeah i liken it the same thing to my dry age room with that that concept is that
*  you know if you don't have that free flowing air in that kind of that oxygen in the room it has an
*  impact on flavor if you have like a swampy wet environment it's gonna impact the beef i think
*  about that all the time but here's the monkey wrench in that theory catfish catfish is delicious
*  it's delicious but if you have a catfish from a pond it's not as good so like river catfish
*  is what you want because it's probably water probably i mean i've i've had catfish that is
*  just absolutely phenomenal yeah i've also had catfish that was kind of muddy you know right
*  right and there's different methods that people use to try to get rid of that muddy like that i've
*  seen people soak them in milk i've heard of people even soaking them in coca cola which is really
*  weird i've never heard that i've heard milk i've heard you know buttermilk breaks it down a little
*  bit you know but then again if you're going to fry anything with buttermilk and crust then you know
*  you can have cardboard in there tastes good oh really yeah right that's like the spices and
*  the crust is what you're eating more than the actual flavor of the flesh itself yeah um last
*  time i entertained fly fish i haven't done it in years but last time i entertained it i was with
*  my family we were in montana we were taking a whitewater rafting trip down the gallatin river
*  which is really fun yeah uh but as we're going there there was all these guys that were fly fishing
*  and they seemed like the most peaceful people in the world just casting and and just slowly
*  manipulating this and then they were catching these these trout and then just gently catching
*  them and then releasing them yeah and we have a group of guys that we do this with we travel
*  all around there's maybe about like eight to ten of us where we'll go and we'll go on a trip together
*  and jimmy kimmel does this with you oh yeah oh he is he is obsessed with fly fishing you know we
*  are both like it's just a whole journey we log the trips we talk about what was caught you catch your
*  do you rather tie your own flies um i've done it but um i don't do it now i mean with the restaurant
*  the way it is you know it's it's always just so time consuming so time consuming and now that
*  they make such beautiful patterns but there is maybe the next level like when i retire quote
*  unquote you know like delve into i have like a whole mailbox desk with all like the hackle and
*  everything there but it's just sitting there you know how you talk about how
*  making your own knives is like another level i would imagine that tying your own fly it's the
*  same thing catching like a large trout you know it's that whole process the lead up to
*  you have a pattern or it's even just like what are they eating seeing what's getting what's
*  hatching coming off and matching the hatch or there's some the temperature of the water the
*  water levels the speed like the first thing we check before we go on a trip is what are the water
*  levels what's the the the water flow like because you know if it's going too fast like the trowder
*  like getting like all the dirt everything you know hitting them in the face you know but like
*  there's a certain like level where you look for where it's best for you know so it's always like
*  okay what are the conditions like you know you go through it so it's like a whole process before
*  like the lead in that how did you start well i've always loved you know fishing like any kind deep
*  sea anything as a kid like it was my escape since i was a little kid but um i think that i always
*  looked at fly fishing as like the higher level you know i always aspired there was like like i
*  saw i remember being um on the delaware river and i was at camp and there was a guy just underneath
*  a bridge and he just kind of picked up like 20 30 yards of line he just laid it down and i was up
*  at high level and i just saw the fish come up and bite it and i was just like i was just like whoa
*  you know just like blew me away and then from that point on i always wanted to and then i bought my
*  first fly rod and um they always remember you know you always remember your first fly rod i
*  still have it um and uh and it just started the obsession there there's just something about the
*  connection to the fish and the whole thing as opposed to just kind of like going on a boat
*  and trolling and waiting for them to strike like this is more like hunting what you're doing is
*  is like you're trying to find the location of the fish and then you have to place the fly and you
*  have to like let it drift without any drag and it's like this combination of skill and intuition
*  and hunting that's the excitement whereas just catching and throwing meat in the thing
*  okay i mean i've done it and i still do it i like being on the water but
*  fly fishing is just like this higher level thing do you do any kind of fishing with lures other
*  than fly fishing do you ever like not really and i can't even like there's so much social pressure
*  you know amongst my group anyway because they get on me because all most of the guys are dry
*  fly jimmy is like dry fly only like even if like no we should explain dry flies or flies that float
*  on the surface on the surface it's like the epitome of like delicate presentation and then
*  underneath you know you can basically you follow like the life cycle of an insect so
*  in the eggs go to the bottom and then the larva comes up and it kind of floats to the surface and
*  then it pops open and it flies away most of the fish eat all the food that subsurface so before
*  it even gets to the surface so their eyes are like straight down when the conditions are right the
*  trout are looking up because the hatch happens so that's when all the bugs are coming up and
*  the take is you see the fish and it's more dramatic jimmy is like straight up like dry
*  fly fisherman like even if like and it all comes from like one of our mentors and this is hui
*  lewis like he's part of hui lewis in the news yes he's one of really like he is like one of like
*  he's one of our group hip to b square yeah 100 he is lives in montana and he is like we talk about
*  every year fishing on the bitter root for the squala hatch which is a certain kind of almost
*  like a salmon fly it's very large and when these things come up and and hatch like fish are huge
*  and they're hitting and jumping out of the water it's very dramatic so wow yeah and does everybody
*  catch them release or does any do you ever run into people that catch them and cook them
*  not in our group it's very looked down upon huge you would never i mean even me like i'll like they
*  they tease me because if they're not biting on the flies like i'll drop a bead head which is
*  like underneath the fly and so it's like kind of like they call it like bobber fishing you're
*  cheating cheating so it's not it's like they call it down and dirty as opposed to you know on the
*  surface that's so silly yeah yeah isn't it crazy sometimes i just want to see a fish at the end
*  listen there's bow hunters you know i bow hunt and there's bow hunters that also rifle hunt
*  and then there's bow hunters that look at rifle hunters like it's like legalized poaching yep
*  like what are you doing you're using a rifle on an animal same thing but then there's other people
*  that have a really good ethical argument for that like hey if i am at 200 yards and i see an elk or
*  a deer and i squeeze that trigger that is a dead animal 100 percent of the time it's a huge
*  responsibility it's not even 100 but it's very high 90s yeah yeah that's a huge responsibility
*  for the animal i mean you know you want the animal just to you know not suffer well it's also there's
*  something about the difficulty factor of bow hunting it's very effective when the arrow hits
*  the animal the animals die like they could die as quick if not quicker than a rifle with a well
*  placed arrow because they bleed so quickly it goes through the vitals and they're done in seconds
*  but it's harder to do and it requires an immense amount of discipline and dedication and i'm sure
*  fly fishing requires some but with bow hunting you literally have to practice every day yeah i mean
*  you think you saw in the back i have a archery range in the garage back there where you see
*  there's a 45 yard range and i shoot arrows every day i love it i have a bow too like i've never
*  psc i have a psc yeah it's beautiful it's a great bow i went down with my friend glenn jonas he like
*  took me down he's like hunter he's like this is what you get and i got it and i don't get enough
*  practice in i've never gone hunting with it so you know yeah it's not something i recommend
*  when when i have i wanted to though i mean i you know i have friends that want to do it they're like
*  i want to go bow hunting with you mike no you don't yeah if you did you'd be out there practicing
*  every day like it's it's it's a thing that once you once you realize what's at stake how difficult
*  it is to do how much respect you have to have for the the art of archery and how much how much
*  effort has to be put into the discipline most people don't want to do that like if you really
*  want to hunt your own meat and this is one of the things that's come up during this pandemic
*  because people are really scared about the food supply and they're they're scared about not having
*  food in their home that they can rely upon and also before that there was this whole thing about
*  gathering organic meat like people were worried about the source of the meat they were worried
*  about animals that weren't treated correctly and factory farming and all those all the different
*  things that people should be concerned about and the ultimate solution to that is get an animal
*  that's in the wild yeah that this is way this way this animal's been living the way they've been
*  living for hundreds of thousands of years and you just you you stealthily make your way through
*  their world get yourself into a position and then through hard work and dedication and understanding
*  and take an animal ethically yep i'm with you on that yeah i think it's great i mean and also i love
*  that you know the responsibility you take for it you know it's it's like you know some people don't
*  understand hunting they think it's just a bunch of yahoos going out there and some maybe are but
*  you know the people that i know that take it seriously you know take a huge responsibility
*  with it and the people that i know that do it that take a huge responsibility they're some of
*  the best people i've ever met my life and the most dedicated and the kind of hunting that i do which
*  is western mountain elk hunting requires physical fitness it requires incredible stamina because
*  you're you're going gaining and losing thousands of feet of elevation in a day you might trek
*  15 20 miles every day i mean you have to be fit and you have to be ready and then you have to be
*  able to keep your nerves and then that final moment yeah you know it's it's like yeah you
*  could hunt for 10 days for one moment so you're you're hunting for 10 days for 15 seconds that's
*  it's profound like the build-up it's amazing you know you got to keep your shit together yeah my
*  god it's it's hard and there's no catch and release no catch release and bow hunting but when i sit
*  down and i feed my family the code though if you really look at it it's i mean if you just focus on
*  the catch and release or whatever but there's a code to it i mean you get it you know i i i
*  believe in that yeah the code the difference between bow hunting and regular hunting versus
*  regular fishing and fly but even just regular hunting you know and bow hunting i'm just saying
*  you're hunting with guys that that you know have an ethical responsibility understand the environment
*  you know and follow the rules and i think that you know yeah that's amazing well it's also the
*  the thing to consider is there's millions in fact billions of dollars every year that go into
*  wildlife habitat go into preservation all the different people that work as game wardens are
*  all paid by this and this is all money that's taken from hunting licenses a pretend the pickman
*  robertson act they take a certain percentage of i think it's 10 of all the proceeds from
*  ammunition sales licenses equipment all that stuff goes to preservation and it goes it actually
*  is the the number one the source the number one source of for economics in terms of financial
*  this the like the the amount of resources that go to managing these areas and keeping these animals
*  healthy and monitoring them and monitoring their populations and even reintroducing different
*  animals like rocky mountain sheep and all these different animals that elk that get introduced
*  into all these different places all that money comes from hunting and it's it's crazy to think
*  that at one point in time most of the animals in north america that we hunt on a regular basis
*  were on the verge of extinction including white tail deer which is crazy to think if you live in
*  a place that has white tail deer because there's so many of them it's insane but there's more
*  white tail deer today than they were when columbus landed it's really really weird yeah and this is
*  a an incredible system the wildlife management system that's in place in north america including
*  the management of public lands and the access to public lands is a truly special place it's it's
*  truly special here in north america and that is because of the people that love hunting and love
*  these wild areas yeah it makes sense i mean i love it the sustainability factor is everything and i
*  mean i think that's also why the catch and release thing i mean if everybody kept everything that
*  they caught there's just not enough right like in that environment to no i understand you know and
*  people say that about hunting too that if everybody went out and hunted you would you there wouldn't be
*  animals left which is really true so but everyone's not going to do it that's like saying if everybody
*  became a marathon runner the streets would be filled yeah but then you're not gonna yeah that's
*  it's not appealing to a lot of people you know everyone's not going to do and it's very difficult
*  and especially the stuff that i like to do it's just very you can do it yeah a lot of people do it
*  but not nearly as many as go to the supermarket yeah yeah when you get your meat do you have a
*  specific rancher that you use you know it's a great question and it's you know everything is
*  a process and it's part of the process so just kind of like aging the meat and then putting on
*  the plate but there's a whole backstory to this i've developed a relationship one of my closest
*  friends and my mentor in beef is this guy by the name of john tarpol and you know he's he picks out
*  the cattle and and then it goes through the system and you know they audit the system and
*  he i knew him before he came on board with nyman ranch so i knew him when he had his own slaughter
*  house in in granite city illinois and i met him through the guys through master purveyors and then
*  he became i guess the vp of beef in nyman ranch and so i invest most of my focus with him and
*  he's taught me so he's picking out a lot of my cattle and that gets it's done through family
*  farms all antibiotic free steroid free raised ethically animals die with with dignity they're
*  not like cattle prodded and pushed along i mean there's how do they die well most of them well
*  all of them it's it's basically it's like a like a pin you know it's like a it's like a stun bolt
*  and then like no country for old men that thing exactly yeah that's exactly how it's done
*  but it's done in a certain system temple grandin transformed the entire system of
*  of abattoirs in in this country she's do you know about temple grandin no such an interesting woman
*  autistic but she actually is like the cattle whisperer and she can go into the environment
*  and she can see just like a shadow of light going onto the floor and all of a sudden the
*  cattle will see it they'll stop and it builds all the stress and as a result the stress
*  creates you know fear and worry in the animal why are they afraid of light it just can be something
*  normal i mean if they walk clockwise as opposed to counterclockwise in the circle and all these
*  things have an impact she's written several books on it they did a whole series on her like a great
*  movie i think on hbo clare daines played her and but she'll like literally crawl through the
*  abattoir before to understand all the angles and advise you know so the animals don't get super
*  stressed a stressed animal has an impact on the quality of the beef and also you know you don't
*  want to torture anything sure you know there's a responsibility behind you know eating meat i think
*  so you know for me it starts not only with the family farms that they're raising the cattle
*  the feed that they're finishing the cattle on and then how they're transported you know and then how
*  they go through the system in terms of the abattoir storage and then come to me i like to receive a
*  majority of my beef in combos which means it never sees the inside of a cryovac bag the plastic bags
*  for me dry aging that way is also it preserves a lot of the natural good friendly
*  bacteria that's on the meat as opposed to like putting in a bag and then they put steam to like
*  you know almost sterilize the meat and they put it along and so there's all these different flavors
*  that are gathered but you know i think from like john tarboff and nyman ranch you know they're
*  really have been my go-to nowadays but it's like john and his sons you know they really have educated
*  me on beef and and and give me a lot of pride and you know there is a genetic factor for tenderness
*  in beef i mean i didn't realize this but you know it's not just oh that one's really nicely marbled
*  but it's not like you have to look at the grain of the beef so like you're looking at the eye it's
*  not only just the fat it's like how the fat is dispersed and um and that has a huge impact also
*  on stress i mean you can look at a piece of meat and they sometimes they'll call it they'll be
*  rejected called a dark cutter the meat comes almost like dark deep like almost like burgundy red
*  and when the animal's like that the and i've tasted it you know just because i was curious
*  but the quality of the beef is just just because of stress the adrenaline goes to the animal and
*  taints and that's what makes it dark like that's yeah it taints the meat but what about grass-fed
*  beef grass-fed beef i don't you know it's it's a great question you know for me i don't look at
*  grass-fed versus grain-fed i look at nutrition okay so just because something's grass-fed i
*  think sometimes the animals themselves it's it's more stressful to eat grass that is not nutrient
*  rich um so i believe in grass-fed with responsible grass farmers that are then allowing the cattle
*  you know to do grass-fed right which i've experienced over in uh in ireland scotland
*  and in england is it's literally um it's about the nutrition so i mean you go out and you say
*  okay this animal is grass-fed you taste the meat it's like this meat is horrible as opposed to
*  another grass-fed and like this is great so it's not like absolute so for me it's really more about
*  the nutrition like how healthy can you maintain the animal i'm not talking about like force feeding
*  the animal but i think the right the right characteristics of beef that you and i love
*  really come from grain finished beef um as a mainstay but you can find some grass-fed that's
*  competitive with that but it's it's hard to find the the argument about grass-fed beef is primarily
*  a taste if you prefer it and i do a lot of times but also uh health that it's healthier for you the
*  the uh essential fatty acids of a grass-fed cow are different that's true um but but again you
*  know it depends on how you look at steak you know look if you're you're an everyday beef eater you
*  know i think that that that conversation is completely valid but if you're someone who looks
*  at you know steak as an extravagance or something that is you know almost a celebration to enjoy
*  great you know grain finished beef is it's like butter i mean there's no the taste itself it's
*  deep it's rich remember we were talking earlier about like wagyu cattle or you know it's everything
*  has its place but you know for that steakhouse experience i would never want a grass-fed steak
*  for like that broiler steak which is cooked on like that for me it's like a really treat it's a
*  real treat it's it's something like you can't get like i like black angus or angus herford
*  or angus herford cross um that's the that's the cattle that for me brings americana on the plate
*  yeah bourdain felt the same way he was not interested in grass-fed beef the same way i am
*  yeah but there's different levels of grass-fed i mean i've had grass-fed and again it could rival
*  any grain-fed like over in scotland and ireland i mean look at their grass it's so nutrient rich
*  um over here it's a different story especially here right because it's dry and then there's
*  enough water over there it's rainy every day rainy it's green it's it's constantly the cattle
*  is like they're growing their own their substitute you know they supplement barley that they grow on
*  the estate you know the whole thing is just it works so like this whole concept of like saying
*  grass-fed versus grain-fed i think that there's there's another story and that for me is really
*  the nutrition of the animal but i do agree with you there there is the concept of you know healthy
*  nutrition that you'll you'll find higher you know higher traits of that but i'm not a nutritionist
*  at the end of the day so you know are you aware of the carnivore diet i am yeah have you ever
*  messed around with that um yeah so how often do you eat meat yourself well i taste it every day
*  um but to sit down and have a steak it's it's a rarity but i eat a lot of red meat like i eat
*  quite often but you don't sit down and have a steak very often i can't i can't i can't do it
*  because i taste it all the time so like to sit there i need a whole steak i mean i might eat
*  a half a steak you know it's just i i have that flavor it's like it's a whole for a whole month i
*  did it for the month of january they call it world carnivore month it's i eat mostly rib eyes and
*  elk steak and eggs what did you do to your mind i think i've got more aggressive
*  and i'm i'm kind of joking about that and maybe it gave me more energy i don't know it's different
*  something happens it makes sense to me that if you're a cow you don't need to be uh aggressive
*  because you're basically just eating grass and and and chilling most of the time however there's
*  bulls bulls are very aggressive but so that i don't know if my analogy makes sense but if you
*  eat meat and only meat i really feel like there's some kind of a shift that happens with i mean
*  virtually no carbohydrates and you know i might have had like a couple of pieces of chili mango
*  and i think i had a few olives or something like that for the whole month right and i felt great
*  you would think you would feel like shit yeah i did not feel like shit at all i felt really good
*  and i had incredible energy um but i got bored yeah i got bored i wanted to eat other things
*  but there's in you know here we are it's uh may and uh that's a few months ago but i think
*  sometimes like hmm maybe i should get back to that i mean it was only five months ago right
*  but it uh i lost a lot of weight i got down to and that's the other thing too i wonder like
*  whether or not how lean i would get or whether or not that would level off but i wound up i think i
*  wound up losing 12 pounds or somewhere somewhere around that range yeah is that a lot water water
*  weight though i imagine so yeah because in general because you're depleting your glycogen stores you
*  know so at the end of the day you know you're just like yeah thirsty for that in your in your cells
*  you know but it didn't really fuck with my workouts you know i thought i worried about that that it was
*  going to mess with my workouts but i had good energy um but again i only did it for a month
*  i've had friends my friend trevor did it for i think he said he did it for six months but after
*  a while he felt like he was dropping off but then i know people that have been doing it for years
*  and they feel great i lean towards that i can't do it like as a strict you know regiment you know but
*  have you ever tried to do it as a strict measure when you say you can't do it as a strict regiment
*  i have you know i have um but not when i have the restaurant in operation because you know i'm
*  sitting there and you know i'm tasting everything you know making sure everything's right and it
*  includes like a pasta it could just be like a bite and just messes with you oh yeah yeah the
*  the greatest thing in the world to me is intermittent fasting you know for me it's like
*  you know not eat you know from that period of time and you know start eating at like four o'clock in
*  the afternoon and that for me has always been like a godsend that just that works yeah that makes a
*  big impact and especially for people that are struggling with their weight yeah you you know
*  it's so easy to just shove things in your face it's so easy just to continue to eat when you're
*  really not even hungry anymore you're bored like for me the struggle is late at night you know when
*  i come home late at night especially when i was coming home from the comedy store i just want to
*  fucking eat you know i'd want to eat chips yeah or i want to eat some bullshit yeah it's always
*  bullshit when you're tired too it's always the worst food once you get sugar out of your system
*  you don't crave it but once you eat a little bit of sugar then you constantly crave it yes
*  yeah it's that that devil that there's this there's something evil about sugar it's ridiculous it's
*  so devilish there's something about it but it's also so great it's like how can they be how can
*  those two things coexist because like an amazing uh like just ice cream with fudge and some whipped
*  cream is so good sometimes but then the feeling that i have afterwards like you fucking dummy
*  why did you do this to yourself 100 but i mean there's like a feeling like when you take a
*  spoon of that fudge and ice cream you put it in like so good it's like it goes through your whole
*  body i know your body's so happy for that brief period of time but then it's just a trick because
*  then you feel like you got poisoned 100 i remember one time i was eating real strict and then i
*  decided to go off the reservation for a day and i had a cheeseburger with fries and a giant shake
*  a big chocolate shake and my fucking head hurt really i had to lay on the couch and uh my kids
*  were asking me questions like i couldn't even answer i was like what are you i don't know
*  what who am i where am i it was like my head was in a vice it was really it felt like i got drugged
*  yeah i was just like oh i had nothing because your body's also super sensitive yeah because
*  you know because i wasn't eating like that yeah yeah that's the the dance between delicious and
*  nutritious like what is that how do you how do you manage that dance how do you navigate that dance
*  i'm pretty disciplined like you know i'll get into i mean up into this like for the past i mean i was
*  super into working out um you know daily and then i got so focused on the restaurant
*  you know it just looks like i don't have time i got i'm gotta get back to it because i felt so
*  good and so much energy but in terms of like the dance for me i'm like just little snippets of
*  tasting good food like great food like all day um while you're cooking while i'm cooking what is
*  your day like when you get there like when do you get there when do you leave well now um well
*  normally just normally um i'd get in at let's say anywhere from 10 like 10 o'clock and then
*  could leave as late you know typically like 10 30 11 so you guys have a lunch crowd no it's
*  even no lunch it's just preparation really dinner well i have barbecue for lunch and so that's good
*  so i would like sleep there overnight get it going i have this amazing chef marcus who's
*  sleeping there yeah you sleep there because you know you know we're talking about the temperatures
*  and everything so there's a certain time when you need to wrap the beef for example in in uh
*  butcher paper that usually happens at like 4 35 in the morning and if you don't do it you know you
*  miss the window to do it so i don't like to hold the meat too long so to get the better quality
*  you know you have to write it a lot of people they'll just make it earlier put it into the
*  warmer and it will hold but you know i think that there's a huge difference so you know we'll wrap
*  it really really early so that's that's usually what happens so you where do you sleep downstairs
*  just get a cot or something on the couch yeah wow yeah and he set the alarm for 4 30 and yeah yeah
*  oh it's painful so you want to be a chef yeah well that's it you know there's the agony and
*  the ecstasy yeah you know that's it but my usual routine like particularly now like i'll get in
*  by 10 o'clock i take a list of what's you know going on like for that day pack out meals whatever
*  yeah finish like 10 like eight eight but anywhere from between eight to ten that's a long day it's
*  a long day i'm feeling it lately i mean all like the muscles in my hands like i don't even know
*  what's going on that's why i say i have to start training again because i'm like my transitional
*  movement is slow i'm like an old man like i get out of bed i'm like i make the noise like it's
*  just been terrible you know well i also imagine the stress is not good for you either and probably
*  not good for your sleep i've been compartmentalizing a lot of what's going on right now you know that's
*  the only way i'm getting through i you know i have to be strong for my team i have to give really
*  strong leadership i need to inspire them just through example that's the only way because a
*  lot of people they just want to take off and they want to collect unemployment you know yeah the way
*  it's working now it's they make more money beyond unemployment than working it's crazy so um yeah so
*  i have to lead from the front first one in first one out and uh but i compartmentalize so the stress
*  is like there i'm just again i'm focused like okay i gotta feed the hospital workers i gotta feed
*  saint joseph and that well how can i come up with something that the neighborhood wants like to
*  indulge on whether it's meatloaf and peas mashed potatoes or it's fried chicken or it's
*  you know chicken with grains lemon and honey you know something like that so well i can only hope
*  that this is over soon enough and that things will bounce back no me too um but you got an amazing
*  restaurant it's really great i love eating there and i can't wait to come back there again and i
*  really hope that it uh that it's a short amount of time i mean i don't know when and how i don't
*  know how it's gonna we're tough restaurant people are tough oh you have to be just the
*  fucking hours that you put in man do the best that we can that's all you can do you know well
*  thanks brother thanks for being here appreciate you and uh hopefully next time i see you is be at
*  your restaurant yes all right thank you bye everybody
*  bless you
