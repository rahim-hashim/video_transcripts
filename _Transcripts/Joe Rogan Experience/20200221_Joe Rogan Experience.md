# Joe Rogan Experience #1430 - Raghunath Cappo
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [February 21, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAx1Sq6usRg)
*  3, 2, 1, boom! We're live. What's up, Ray? How are you, buddy?
*  Pretty good.
*  Great to see you, man. It's been a while.
*  It's been...
*  Ten years?
*  No, more than that.
*  Really?
*  2007, I moved out of LA.
*  Wow. Damn. It's weird. I've talked about you in the podcast several times, though.
*  You know what? I never listened to the podcast until recently. Someone told me the second
*  time you said... I think three times you've mentioned me.
*  Probably.
*  Yoga Ray.
*  Yoga Ray.
*  All these kids are contacting me. They mentioned Yoga Ray on the show. Yeah, it was cool. I
*  appreciate it. I appreciate you.
*  I appreciate you, too.
*  Yeah. I always thought, truthfully, I always thought Joe Rogan's going to do something
*  good. I honestly, I can tell you that. And it may be embarrassing to say, but I'm proud
*  of you.
*  Oh, thank you. That's very nice.
*  I hope you don't mind me saying that. I'm proud of all you've done.
*  Thank you. That's very nice. That's a funny thing to say, though.
*  And you've had great, just Joe Rogan time, you've done some great stuff. First of all,
*  Stand Up Comedian. That's a great gig.
*  It's a fun gig.
*  It's a great gig. And if I could pick a second thing besides Stand Up Comedian, it'd be the
*  announcer. I wouldn't want to be in the UFC, even if I was good, because you get pounded
*  on and it's a tough job. Right?
*  Yeah. For sure.
*  That's why, you know, I went to Thailand, see those kids fight. They're retired at 21.
*  Yeah. They get beat up.
*  They get beat up bad.
*  Yeah. It's very rare.
*  You're the announcer of the UFC, and you're also skilled at this stuff. Most people think
*  the announcers aren't so skilled sometimes. You're very skilled. I just remember rolling
*  around with you.
*  Yeah.
*  Those were some of the greatest memories of my time in LA, is when Eddie opened 10th Planet.
*  Yeah, we had a lot of fun, man.
*  I mean, it was such a special, interesting time of jiu-jitsu, I think, that it was going
*  to no-gi. There's this demographic of jiu-jitsu guys who didn't want to wear a gi anymore.
*  Yeah. Well, it was a lot of people wanted to learn things that would transition directly
*  into MMA, and to not have the clothes to grab onto, it changed the grips. And Eddie was
*  one of the very first to really, truly concentrate on using wrestling grips, gable grips, over-unders,
*  things along those lines. And the other people were still really clinging to the gi.
*  He was like a, and I think the thing that I was attracted to about the ultimate fighting,
*  when I first saw, I think the first one I saw was two, UFC 2. And I was like, oh man,
*  and you watch those Gracie in action videos, it's like, yeah, this is real stuff. I want
*  to learn real stuff. And so I started even noticing in my gi game, I just played open
*  guard and I was lackadaisical, and I'd always have to tell the guys, hey, do me a favor,
*  just try to slap me, because this is getting a little unreal. I want a real life situation.
*  And I figured, okay, I don't want to get caught up in the gi no gi thing right now, but I
*  always felt like, you know, real practical fighting, the guy may not be wearing a tuxedo.
*  I think both are good, because like, you live in New York, New York gets cold. If you get
*  into a scuffle with someone, I hope you never would do, but if you did, and he was wearing
*  a jacket like yours, you could manipulate him with that jacket, and they really probably
*  wouldn't know what to do. This is a real benefit to being a judo player, if someone has a winter
*  coat on. Yeah, like if you had a fight with Cairo Parisi and Ronda Rousey or something
*  like that, and they were wearing a winter coat, they'll fuck you up. You know, they
*  just grab that thing. Yeah. Okay. Yes. Well, I'm glad I learned that way. Yeah, it's a
*  good way to learn. It's good. It's good for defense too, because the gi keeps you from
*  just yanking out of stuff and exploding out of things. You have to be very patient. You
*  have to be, you have to use correct technique. Anyway, it was appreciation and it was one
*  of my biggest lamentations of moving away was not to be around that whole posse. And
*  then I never expected it to get as big as it did. I know. It's unbelievable, because
*  back then it was like the seed. I used to bring my big kids who are big now, I used
*  to bring them and they used to just box. We used to do it at- Legends. No, before Legends.
*  Oh, Bomb Squad. At the Bomb Squad. Wow, that's crazy. That's old school, old school. Yeah.
*  That's 2002, somewhere around there. Yeah, it was cool. It was a great time. I had just
*  got my purple. I was super excited and then Eddie just got his black. He got his brown
*  and his black super quick. Yeah, he got his brown and then he beat Hoyler and then he
*  got his black. Yeah, I was there that day. Yeah, that was crazy. When John Jock took
*  it off his back. Unbelievable. It was heavy. It was a good place to be at a good time.
*  It was. It's like when you look back at those times, it was an interesting era. It was an
*  era for us as humans. It was an interesting era for martial arts. There's a lot going
*  on and that 10th Planet was really a hub of exciting innovation and still is. But I mean,
*  back then it was this really unique thing. This completely no-gi branch of Jiu-Jitsu
*  that's directly connected to John Jock Machado, which is a totally- Very conservative, legit.
*  John Jock was, is. I was always impressed with him too. He still rolls, man. He's at
*  my age and he doesn't get injured. He might have a little tweak here and there, but he's
*  so intelligent and he's so technical and he's just so good. That was, I'm saying was only
*  because I'm not there anymore, but when I was going there, I was like, this is such
*  an amazing place, John Jock Academy. The quality of fighters you would get there. Yeah. That
*  was also at a time where there wasn't a Jiu-Jitsu in America. I mean, you have to travel to
*  get to a Jiu-Jitsu school. You have to be into it and go somewhere and to have that
*  many black belts at a school, that was like unheard of in Jiu-Jitsu schools. I remember
*  I was in his class one day and there was like 11 black belts. I was like, this is crazy.
*  And it wasn't like that back then. No. There was a random rogue black belt somewhere in
*  Portland or something like that. Yeah, to find them. It was a lot of purple belts teaching
*  schools and blue belts teaching schools in some places even. That was a great time to
*  get into Jiu-Jitsu. Oh yeah. Like I went, I started with HENZO in New York. Yeah. I went
*  there the day that Matt Serra got his purple belt. Wow. That's crazy. It's not crazy. It
*  was, it was such a cool, interesting time in Jiu-Jitsu. That place is still the top
*  place in the world. It's pretty impressive. And HENZO was such a great guy too. He's the
*  best. He's so nice. Sweet. I gave him a CD of my band just as a gift. I just met him
*  and he gave me a Krugen gi. Wow. Yeah. That's legit. It was super legit. Krugans was the
*  gi back then. That was the gi. Yeah. If you had a Krugans, like, ooh. You know. It was
*  a fair trade. I wasn't a trade. I just wanted to give him a gift and he just like, without
*  thinking just threw it back at me. He had a great attitude. Well, he still does. He's
*  so loved. Like I said, I mean, that's one of the really nice things about Jiu-Jitsu
*  is the camaraderie and the friendship. It's like, it's very different than I was compared
*  to other martial arts and that the problem with striking martial arts is that you hurt
*  each other all the time. You never developed a sort of closeness that you do with Jiu-Jitsu
*  because you're always trying to kick each other's fucking heads off. Well, you know,
*  I did a stunga yoga for years where it's sort of silent and you're just doing a set series
*  of poses. I could be with people like every day for a year and practically never speak
*  to them. Right. I remember meeting a guy at the DMV. I was like, I know you. You're right
*  next to me every morning for two hours, but we've never spoken. Jiu-Jitsu, you become
*  best friends with the guy that you walk out with like 20 new friends. You know each other
*  so well too. Like, you know, when someone's breaking, you know, when someone's exhausted,
*  you know, when someone's getting better, you know, when someone's really been consistent,
*  you know, you roll with someone, they're super sharp. Like, what have you been doing?
*  Right. What are you doing four days a week now? Right. Oh, wow. You see it. Yeah, they
*  become like your best friends. Yeah. Well, it's also like we appreciate when someone's
*  really good. Like if you roll with someone and they're really good and they start getting
*  you and they didn't used to get you before you like, you get excited. Like, all right,
*  I got to ramp up my game because you're doing really well. You have a different metric with
*  all these. Yeah. Well, I remember you being one of the first guys that I knew that got
*  into yoga and yoga is a huge part of jujitsu now. So many people that train in jujitsu.
*  I think by the way, I'm jujitsu illiterate now. I still know. What did you when you stopped
*  with your brown belt? I was purple. I was purple because I didn't I stopped going to
*  John Josh classes and we just wanted to and I think it's sort of before Eddie started
*  giving out. Actually, maybe he did. He was giving out belts pretty early. But I just
*  wasn't it was confusing. It was confusing because I was sort of with John Jock, right?
*  But I just I wanted to do the no gees stuff. Yeah. And Eddie had this natural flex has
*  this natural flexibility that I related to and he's my size and I related to that. And
*  I'm not like I was never super athlete in high school or anything like that. I was short,
*  but I was flex. I was reasonably flexible and yoga got me really flexible. And so I
*  appreciate I was like, okay, he has a really great clothes guard game. I want to learn
*  that from him. And I really sort of like honed in on what he could give. Yeah. And
*  so yeah, I never like approach them. Hey, can I have a belt? Do you ever feel vulnerable
*  weird time my life? But you know, do you ever feel the desire to do it again? Yeah, I do
*  every now and then I go back. But I tell you, when I train because I trained with you guys
*  and trained with John Jock, it's hard to go to some it's hard to do it now. It's 20 years
*  later, all the stuff I just know I just did some Jiu Jitsu the other day was at some school
*  and someone got mad at me for I guess it's illegal some of the stuff I did. What did
*  you do? I did a bicep scissors. That's not illegal. It's not legal. So no, some could
*  play that I sat on someone's chest. I do a mount where I put the feet forward. I don't
*  remember how you sit with that. Yeah, and I'll crank their neck. Yeah, not to tap them,
*  but just to have them react and give me an arm or something. So my feet are forward,
*  I'm sitting on their mount, I pull their head up and they panic or something and throw an
*  arm up. Right. And then I'll take a triangle or an arm. So I did that to someone until
*  you can't neck crank. Listen, I didn't know you're going to know that's not a good school.
*  It's that's those are legit techniques. Neck cranks are legit. Right? Yeah. All right.
*  I'm crazy. And you know what? You just went to a bad. Yeah, but no, I don't think so.
*  Here's the deal. I don't want to learn this stuff to win points. Right. You know, I wanted
*  to learn. Now I want to learn. You know, that's how I know this other guy that was on your
*  show, James, James Wilkes. Yes. Great guy. The ultimate fighter. Great guy. Yeah. No,
*  I knew him because I used to do some knife fighting with him. Oh, yeah. He's a tactical
*  instructor. Yeah, he's a real he's super rounded guy. Yeah, very rounded guy. I knew him right
*  when he just started jujitsu. You see, he did a debate with I saw a guy I saw about
*  his documentary. It's very interesting because that debate really should be like 15 hours
*  long. We only got into some points that the other guy fucked up and got incorrect. And
*  you get in the weeds with nutrition stuff, you know, because he was a part of that game
*  changer documentary. Yeah. You know, I heard the documentary was good. I sat down with
*  my kids to watch it. It's interesting. It's like there's a lot of it that's not legit.
*  And then there's a lot of it is like you can eat only plants, you can you can be healthy
*  eating only plants, but you have to do it right. And it's not easy. And it's different
*  for everybody. And some people it does not agree with their body. It's not the optimum
*  way for them to eat. For some people when they get off of it and just start eating like
*  more paleo or they start eating grass fed meat, they feel so much better. Like I just
*  don't know if there is a perfect no, I do know there's not a perfect diet for any like
*  single human being on this planet. It's not like one diet that you could lock in. And
*  if you ate that way, you'd be fine. Everybody's different. And people have all these weird
*  autoimmune disorders and shit. And a lot of them are triggered by certain carbohydrates
*  and plants. And when you eliminate those things from your diet, you find all these skin problems
*  clear up and people are trying to figure out what's that all about. And there's all these
*  people that think that maybe it's there's certain toxins like oxalates and polyphenols
*  and stuff that exist in plants that might trigger your your gut sensitivity or autoimmune
*  issues in the gut. It's so in the weeds, man. It's like you can go on and on and on. And
*  you can debate about details. And everyone has a point. They all have a point. The vegan
*  people have a point when it comes to ethics, when it comes to animal rights, when it comes
*  to like cruelty and factory farming, they have a point. And then the health conscious
*  people, the people that are like, you know, I don't give a fuck about that. I'm just I'm
*  just trying to be healthy. And I cured up all my my diseases by just eating grass fed
*  meat. I'm just going to buy it from, you know, ethical ranchers. They have a point too.
*  Right. Well, last appreciation with Joe Rogan really for what is I was I'm appreciating
*  your independent thinking. It takes a lot because it's really easy just to opt into
*  one side and dig your heels in. It's bad for you, though. It's bad for you. It's bad. It
*  stops you from actually free thinking. And that's a problem with anything you get into
*  be politics or be it religion or spirituality or be it ethics and diet.
*  Everything. Everything. The way behavior. I think people have to realize that you are
*  not your thoughts. You are a yoga thing. Yeah, you are not your thoughts. You're a person
*  and you you accept thoughts and sometimes become attached to them. But it's not good
*  to do. Sometimes you should reexamine those thoughts and don't don't hold onto them as
*  if they're a part of you. People argue points. They'll argue subjects and topics as if they're
*  arguing their very value as a person. They're very value to exist. And it's crazy. It's
*  not a good way to think. If someone tells me I'm wrong, everyone's instinct when someone
*  tells you wrong, it's like, no, you're wrong. You get into this very petty world. But my
*  disciplined reaction when I'm doing it correctly is to go, hmm, OK, how am I wrong? What did
*  I do wrong? And just do be don't take it personally. Just these are not this is not I mean, if
*  you've made a mistake, that's just a mistake. People you're not a perfect person. No one
*  is. Everyone makes mistakes. So if you make a mistake about a fact or a subject or just
*  pause, just pause and take it, go, OK, what was wrong? And then is this person correct?
*  Are you wrong or are they incorrect? And can you correct them without getting personal
*  about it, too? Can you that's another thing. Can you tell someone that they're wrong or
*  that you believe they're wrong without it getting weird? That's hard to do as well because
*  then that other person is going to be very attached to what they've said. I mean, people
*  dig their heels in.
*  Yeah, these are all these are all points I'm working on in my book I'm working on, which
*  is sort of extracting all these teachings of ancient yoga, but not not getting lost
*  in just philosophical thought, not getting lost in how to make it relevant and practical.
*  But it's exactly what you're saying. Yeah, it's hard for people. It's hard. Independent
*  thinking is difficult nowadays because it's it's not the easy way out. Right. It's easy
*  to have your clothes picked out for you and your ideology picked out for how you're supposed
*  to look and where you're supposed to and if I'm a Democrat, I'm supposed to be like this
*  and not like this.
*  Do you remember Bud, Bud Bretzmann? He was one of the guys that trained with us at John
*  Jock's. He was older guy, younger guy is my age at the time. You know, he was in his 30s.
*  Anyway, Bud only wears black. He's been on this podcast before. He's a good friend of
*  mine. He lives down the street from me. He only wears black. Okay. He wears black shirts.
*  He wears black pants. I go, why remember him? I go, why do you only wear black? And he goes,
*  I don't think about this way. It is good. It's a nice way to think you go in his closet.
*  I'm like, oh my God, this is a crazy person. It's like all black t-shirts, all black jeans.
*  Like, what the fuck are you wearing? But he never thinks. He just puts his pants on. Like,
*  that's one less thing I have to think about. I was like, all right, that's his thing. Everything's
*  black. Easy. Yeah. Black sneakers. Check. Black pants. Check. Black socks. All right.
*  That's his thing. And he doesn't doesn't have to spend time thinking about his image. Like,
*  this is what he wears. It's a burden. That was the one thing I really was relieved from me as a monk.
*  I was a monk. Did you know that? Yeah. I don't know if you know my bio or know me just from Jiu-Jitsu.
*  I don't even know how you called me up, truthfully. It was a weird situation. I was traveling with a
*  bunch of students. I'm a yoga teacher, by the way. My name's Raghunath Ray. Well, how did you get
*  that name? So Raghunath was, oh, my name's since about 91. A teacher in India gave it to me. And
*  How does that work? How'd that work? It works where you approach teachers that resonate with you,
*  that sort of speak to you. The universe sends you people that speak to you. I mean, I'm sure you've
*  found that in your own life. There's certain people that explain something better than anybody
*  and might be at different times in your life. And then the teacher feels you're ready and they want
*  to like, sort of like give you a mantra. So they give you a mantra and the mantra is, mantra sound.
*  And the sound is very powerful because sound affects the way we think. They say as far as
*  transformation in yoga, like we do something very physical, and it starts to transform the body.
*  You're into yoga now, from what I know of you. We both, I guess, we've been researching each other,
*  but so, and you have an appreciation for yoga because it radically starts to change your body
*  and then starts to sort of slow down the pace of your thoughts and your mind and helps with your
*  endurance and your cardio and all that stuff. So the grossest way to change is the change of the
*  body and the breathing start to also change your cardiovascular system, your endurance.
*  And then of course, the sounds that we hear, they say, are the most transformational.
*  And it's almost hard to believe, especially coming from the West, because in the West, we're thinking,
*  you know, sounds, how's that going to make me healthy? But it's all about sound that creates
*  a healthy mind, a calm mind, a connected mind. The mind can, the idea behind yoga is it can go to
*  a dark place. The mind can go to a very dark place very quick. And those thoughts, you were just as,
*  we're not our thoughts, but our thoughts can get us into trouble, they can get us in jail,
*  they can get us divorced. They could cause, the thoughts create an action.
*  And so we might have an external cleanliness, but if we don't have that internal cleanliness,
*  you're not actually healthy. So there's a different metric of what health is in the yoga system.
*  And we've always taken it in the Western world to be, well, we're going to, you know, health means
*  fitness, you know, and so we're going to become fit. But you could be fit and be angry. You could
*  be fit and be resentful. You could be fit and be unforgiving. And so then the next question is,
*  what is actual health then? Where is, what is full spectrum health look like?
*  And that's sort of what I love, what yoga addresses. And I feel like what we are doing there
*  in these great martial arts teachers that we've had teach us is how to be sort of almost like
*  you're fighting this fight, but there's no rage. You're not actually even angry at the person.
*  It's actually just, you're just doing what you're supposed to do right now.
*  Can I be completely relaxed and do this?
*  Pete Slauson Under stress.
*  Jared Slauson Under incredible amount of stress. The guy's trying to choke the life out of you.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, literally.
*  Jared Slauson Yeah, I had, you know, I had a fight back then. I don't like to fight. I'm not like,
*  I don't look at myself as a fighter. I look at myself more as a meditator. I got in a fight
*  right at that time, probably when I saw you last.
*  Pete Slauson What happened?
*  Jared Slauson It was in Santa Monica. A guy stole my car.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, wow.
*  Jared Slauson It was my first date with my wife.
*  So, it was our first date. We married 16 years. The guy stole my car.
*  Pete Slauson And how did you catch him?
*  Jared Slauson Well, we are walking up the street and she said, oh, you left your lights on in your
*  car. And I said, no, I have a, I have a sob. You need the keys to turn on the, to get the lights on
*  so I can't be in my car. But my top was down, it was a convertible sob, and the top was down.
*  And I was like, man, that is my car. How are my lights on? And then I realized,
*  there is this dude in my car trying to start my car. And my wife left her keys in the glove
*  compartment and I guess he opened the glove compartment, went into a convertible, which
*  was open. I had no, it was one of those old sob 900s I used to have. And you put the keys in
*  and he just couldn't start because it wasn't the right keys. So, I don't know if it was
*  because of yoga or jiu jitsu or whatever it was, but I was so calm about it. I just said,
*  hold my sweatshirt. And I was super skinny then. I was like, I don't know if you remember my diet,
*  I was 100% raw foodist, vegan, like, you know, a buck 47 soaking wet with a crystal in my pocket,
*  you know? And I just said, in a very calm way, I just said, hold my jacket. And I ran,
*  I jumped on the back of the trunk, I jumped over and jumped on his head. And then I,
*  and I'm small, so I drive real close to the steering wheel. And I slipped behind him and
*  tried to choke him, but I couldn't get deep enough behind him to get the choke in. And it was this
*  big dude. I couldn't really tell from when I jumped, but it was a big dude. I just said, and he said,
*  you trying to choke me? I'm gonna kill you. But it was such a stalemate because he couldn't move.
*  I couldn't get the choke in deep enough. And it was just a stalemate. And it went on for like three
*  minutes just there. But I was just breathing. And then it went back to grab my face. And you do that
*  thing in Jiu Jitsu where you hook the guy's arm with your leg. So he had that, I had that arm trapped.
*  He couldn't move. I couldn't move. My wife was looking at me. She's not calling the cops.
*  She's just like looking there shocked. It's your first minute. It's our first date. It's midnight
*  in Santa Monica, right? Like in the right. You know, the coffee bean or something. Yeah.
*  And finally, we stand up in the seat. We're standing in the front seat. My windows are up
*  at the top is down. I cup his neck. And I punch him twice. And he grabs me by the shirt.
*  I grabbed him by the shirt. And we throw each other through the windows. Oh,
*  jeez. And they snap and shatter. We fall out of the car over the door and roll in the street.
*  And I put him in my guard. And then he just at that point, I think, he just turned and ran.
*  And I pulled his shirt off. Check this out. I had his shoes. His shoes fell off. They were sort of
*  like untied Adidas. His shoes fell off. His pants dropped to his ankles because they were low hanging
*  pants, sagging pants. His baseball hat fell off. And he pulled his shirt. And I had a shirt and he
*  ran away. And we're both covered in blood because there's glass all over us. And he runs away in his
*  underwear pulling up his pants in his socks. And that's the story. My wife looks at me. I was like,
*  why didn't you call the cops? She's like, I don't know. That was the coolest thing I've ever seen.
*  I was like, that was the coolest thing I've ever done. She's like, he could have had a gun.
*  I was like, yeah, I know. He could have actually killed me. I've never, you know,
*  I don't know how I would react again if that ever happened. But that's just what happened.
*  I think it's because it was sort of like in that mood of this is my duty. I have to protect my car.
*  Right. And also the other thing is you are used to like pretty intense conflict when you're doing
*  jujitsu all the time. And then, you know, we did MMA. Yeah. Yeah. And all those guys at
*  Sean Jox were either cops. I'd call them cops or robbers. They were like one of them. Well,
*  the thing about jujitsu is you do it full blast, right? You don't break arms or actually choke
*  people unconscious. If they tap, you let go. But you're that last moment. Yeah. You're going as
*  hard as you can. That's the difference. You're so accustomed to that. So when you're rolling with
*  this guy also, people that aren't accustomed to that, they feel vulnerable. Panic. What is this
*  guy going to do? You feel it right away. They feel awkward. They feel strange. Yeah. Like I've rolled
*  with people that don't know how to roll. Just joking around rolling with people. Like, come on,
*  let me do jujitsu with you. Let me see what it feels like. They're helpless. They're helpless.
*  Helpless. It's a weird feeling. It's like, you look like a normal, you look like my size. You know,
*  you look like we and I should be, but you're vulnerable. You're so vulnerable. Right. It's
*  just like, there's such a big learning curve. It's so sharp. It's so sharp. It's so sharp. But
*  once you get to like blue belt, purple belt, it's like that area, like a regular person is really
*  helpless. They really are. You know, it's interesting, even with that fight, I don't
*  look at myself as a fighting guy or, and I definitely don't look for fights, but it's almost
*  like you're learning a game. Yeah. And then you realize, oh, this game is completely deadly.
*  Yeah. It is a deadly game. I mean, this is exactly what it is. You're playing a game of,
*  I'm trying to kill you. You're trying to kill me, but we're really good friends.
*  That's the crazy thing. It's like a lot of guys who have technically killed me,
*  you know, cause I had a tap. They're my, they're basically good friends. Best friends. Yeah.
*  They're really nice, you know, and I can't wait to try to kill them again. It's like, it's a very
*  strange thing to practice, but it's very cleansing. Like the people that do it all the time.
*  It's like therapy. Yeah. They're so peaceful. Yeah. I don't know if any other, I didn't really
*  study other martial arts except a little Muay Thai in Thailand, but I wonder if you get the same
*  feeling. It's cleansing. Cause you don't have to pull, you don't have to, you know, either go light
*  or you, I mean in Thailand, it was like, I went to kick a guy and he blocked it with his shin,
*  you know, he lifted his knee and I got a bruise from my ankle to my knee. That was like,
*  yeah, it's brutal. It's brutal. It's brutal. Yeah. You really have to condition the shit out of your
*  shins. It takes years too. Yeah. It's just a different sort of camaraderie. There's real
*  camaraderie with striking, but again, it feels weird because you do hurt each other. So you don't
*  have that same sort of bond that you have in jujitsu. Also, there's a thing in jujitsu is body
*  contact. Like body contact is different. You know, it's like you're old, you're like,
*  like people who don't have good friends, they never hug. Yeah. Right. There's a lot of men
*  who don't want to be touched by another man. Like, I don't know why I'm not giving a reason why,
*  but if you go, Hey, what's up? And you go and hug them or just shake them. They like,
*  they're just grossed out by the touching of another man. Yeah. You got to get over that quick.
*  Yeah. I mean, how many times have I talked about jujitsu with people and the people that don't do
*  so you roll around with other guys. Isn't that kind of gay? Like people say that all the time
*  video out there at one time, jujitsu, that's the gayest sport around. Remember that it was from
*  some TV show. Oh yeah. They're like, I'm going to learn Brazilian jujitsu. Yeah. Yeah. Well,
*  I mean, look, some of the positions like being in the guard or being on someone's back, you know,
*  whatever. So you were the first guy that I knew that was really into yoga back then I knew Hicks
*  in like when that documentary choke. Yeah, that was great. That was a great documentary. It showed
*  how much jujitsu and yoga together made Hicks in this really incredible force. It was the yoga had
*  affected his mind in this great way because he was able to meditate and he would do all these
*  incredible yoga poses. He was so flexible and he had such dexterity of his arms and legs. I mean,
*  a lot of people got excited about yoga because of Hicks in, but you were the first guy that I knew
*  that really went so deep into it. You actually became an instructor because when I first knew
*  you, I knew that you were in a band and that you, you did yoga then a little bit because everybody
*  called you yoga Ray, but it's like, I felt like you were on this path and this, this yoga pack
*  I could tell. And then paying attention to you on social media and following you. It's like,
*  well, he's really into this shit. I remember when you were moving to New York, we had talked online
*  and you were going out there to teach jujitsu or excuse me, yoga. And I was like, I don't even
*  think he does jujitsu anymore. I think he's just all doing yoga now. And that's what happened.
*  Right. You know, I did music for most of my life with the youth of today. Youth of today was the
*  band before I became a monk. And then I, and at the height of that career, this was a New York
*  city, hardcore straight edge band. We didn't drink, we didn't smoke. And we, you know,
*  we're all strict vegetarians. That's me in a more relaxed form. That's a good photo.
*  So that's what I did as, and, and the idea of the band, we were teenagers, we were all teenagers,
*  me and my buddy Paramananda, who also later moved into an ashram. So we started this when we were
*  16, 17. And it was a cool scene, making our own music and stuff like that. But when we got
*  youth of today together, it was about sort of a message of better living, positive mental attitude,
*  these spiritual principles like karma, and what goes around comes around and respect, dignity,
*  controlling your senses and your mind.
*  And what led you to that?
*  I don't know.
*  Really?
*  I don't know.
*  Really?
*  I've always been interested in, my idea of a good time was, this was like 80s in New York
*  city was, you find these like Eastie Westie bookstores that have books on yoga and metaphysics
*  and reincarnation, and just plop it down and read books all afternoon by swamis and sadhus and
*  weirdos and palm readers and stuff like that. That's my idea of what a good time was.
*  And I always felt like life is meant for our self edification. That's why we're here. We're here on
*  a mission of growth. And when I read books by sages or mystics and things like that, I was always like,
*  I want to be like that. That's what I want to be. That's bigger than anything out there that I want
*  to be. So truthfully, the band, I never really want, I'm not a musician. I play a little bit
*  of everything. I wrote all the songs, but I always looked at myself as more like a seeker
*  and maybe a spokesperson. But then at a certain point in the success of that band,
*  I started realizing, okay, now we're big. And there's a lot of people who are following those
*  sort of principles of controlling your senses. We don't drink, we don't smoke,
*  we don't take drugs, we can care about what we eat. But that's not the goal. That's like a doorway
*  to something bigger. And so for me, I had to step away from that. Even though it wasn't bad or
*  anything, it wasn't what I wanted to become. And it was a certain point in my life. You get to a
*  certain end of a chapter in your life. And for me, at the time it was the height of the band's
*  career as well. We started touring internationally and stuff like that. But I realized there was no
*  amount, and by the way, this was 80s in New York, which is a very cool time, Run DMC, Madonna,
*  the Beastie Boys. You never knew what was about to blow up and you were with all these other people
*  that they were your inspiration and they were your friends and stuff like that. So at that height
*  and excitement, I just said, there is no amount of material success I want that's going to fill
*  sort of like a God-shaped hole in my heart. There's nothing out there that I want. And it
*  was also a very precarious time in my life. Not precarious, but a time where my father
*  went into a coma for three years. Oh, Jesus. I know. It's so horrible to even think about it.
*  What happened was he got some unknown lung infection. He was young, 64. Unknown lung
*  infection and there was some neglect in the hospital and his lung collapsed. And so comas
*  are one of these places where you don't, is he not dead? Is he alive? And it's so confusing
*  for a person that loves that person, how to even react. And I'll say in a humiliating way,
*  I couldn't deal with it. And I sort of shut myself off. And I went and just started working
*  on my music, something I could do. And then at his death, when he finally left his body,
*  I was cultivating a strong desire to go to India and study more. And at that time,
*  I was also studying yoga, Ayurvedic medicine. So he went into a coma for three years. Three years.
*  And then when he died- At the end of the coma. He never came out of the coma.
*  He never came out of the coma. And when he left his body, I decided, I'm going to India now.
*  That was a sign for me and I quit the band. And this is at the peak of the band.
*  It was at the peak of Youth of Today. Was that hard to walk away from all that?
*  You know what? I was at a point where I was saying, and you've probably experienced this too,
*  and I'm sure Eddie probably does too. Sometimes when you become very successful at something,
*  that same thing- The thing that you love sort of can eat away at you as well. Sometimes the people-
*  I'll share it. I'll share with you how I saw it. I remember sitting in an ashram on 24th Street,
*  a Sivananda ashram. Sivananda was like a Swami. He traveled the world. He taught the teachings
*  of yoga outside India and he wrote lots of books. And there's a library of books,
*  or a bookstore up on 24th Street where he has an ashram in New York City.
*  And I remember reading this one quote by him in the midst of my life as in a band and being a
*  teenager living in New York City. And it was- Before you- The first one was really interesting.
*  Where is your happiness coming from? Is it coming from your day-to-day living?
*  Or is it just happiness from your ego? And I thought, where is my happiness coming from?
*  Is it from me being a person that I want to be? Is it from- You know, people nowadays,
*  they collect houses, they collect cars, they collect so many things. I collected records.
*  I collected rare punk records. And in my brain, I thought, oh man, this is so weird.
*  You got to understand what the music scene was like that if you're unfamiliar with it.
*  There was a band that was great and they put out 1,007-inch records. And then the band broke up.
*  Yet the punk scene always grew. So these records you bought for two bucks are now worth-
*  people pay $100 for that record. And so me and my guitar player Purcell, we had like
*  thousands of incredibly rare punk records that if you remember the world of records,
*  no one played their records because you could damage them. What you did was you put everything
*  on a cassette. And so I started thinking about this quote by the Swami who said,
*  man, where am I getting my pleasure from? I'm thinking, well, my records are pleasurable.
*  I was like, well, actually the music's pleasurable. The records are only pleasurable
*  when somebody comes over to my house and says, oh my God, you got that record. That record's
*  so impossible to get. And so once I've read that, it was the first shattering of my concept of
*  self and what is joy and what is pleasure based on my ego and all those records that are really
*  valued. And I had really valuable records. And we started our own record company at the time.
*  So we would basically print limited editions of their band. We put out all our friends records,
*  Sick of It All, Gorilla Biscuits. These were all bands that we grew up with, our own band,
*  Youth of Today. And so we put out these records. We'd make limited edition and then we trade these.
*  It's like printing your own currency basically. To make a long story short,
*  after I read that one quote, my whole concept of pleasure changed and I took all those records and
*  I threw them out on stage to all fans, record collector fans. All the rare ones. It was so
*  liberating for me to do that. It was like maybe the first attempt of shedding my ego. That was a
*  roundabout story. But the second part that Swami wrote was, and I'm paraphrasing this of course,
*  the diseases of the soul are not new. They're ancient. The soul is pure. The spirit is pure.
*  But it gets covered by lust, greed, anger, and envy. And I started thinking,
*  well not me. Lusty. I'm not greedy. I'm not angry. I'm in a band. I have no money. You know. And if
*  you've ever been in a band, it costs money to buy a guitar. Got a guitar? Costs money to buy strings.
*  Got strings? Costs money to buy an amp. So it's just like a, it's a money pit to be in a band.
*  You get paid 50 bucks or whatever. So I'm thinking, not me, but as my band got more successful,
*  I realized, man, I do have, there is money out there that I want. And I remember I got offered
*  money for the first time being in a band. Wow. I can get money. I should get, you know, I wrote
*  these songs. I should get more of that money. Then you get in a fight with the drummer. No,
*  I should get that money. We should split it four ways. No way. I do so much more. I book everything.
*  And I realized, wow, I wasn't not greedy. I just had no money. I'm covered with greed.
*  All these people hate the greedy, hate the rich, hate the 1%. You gotta see what would happen if
*  you were in that position. So that was like my first lesson in like, actually I'm complete.
*  I thought I was above it because I didn't drink, because I didn't smoke, because I was a vegetarian.
*  Big deal. Big deal. And it was these, and the spirituality starts to work on these subtle things
*  that are plaguing me. And you know, the people who really want social justice out there, it's very
*  easy to point the finger at everybody and watch what everybody else is doing wrong.
*  But on the yogic path, it's about like putting the microscope on ourself. Where am I wrong?
*  If I really want to change, how can I start to really do some psychic surgery of my own ego,
*  of all these other things that are baked onto the spirit? So anyway, that was,
*  I can't remember how you got on that tangent. Sorry, I go on tangents a lot.
*  Feel free to go on tangents.
*  But that was my first like glimpse of like where I'm at. And so my point was, my success,
*  oh you said, well was it hard to give up the band? And I was like, no, I was so over it. I was over,
*  because here's another one, envy. That plagues the soul, they say. So there's people that are
*  looking up to Joe Rogan, I want to be like that. And there's people that maybe you're looking,
*  although you're pretty big right now. I don't know if you're looking up to anybody, but
*  the feeling like in a corporate world where someone wants your position, and that plagues
*  a person, a person who's not gracious, or a person who's like, there's a scarcity mentality.
*  There's a younger, I know in the music world, there's a band coming up and there's a band I
*  want to get to. And I realized that all these real subtle things, they were plaguing my heart.
*  And these are the things I wanted to work on. And yeah. So yeah, was it hard to give up? No,
*  it wasn't. It was great. I relinquished it.
*  Pete You were on like a spiritual quest.
*  Jared I was on a spiritual quest.
*  Pete A legitimate one. People talk about that kind of stuff all the time,
*  like getting spiritual or being on a spiritual quest, but you legitimately went on this quest,
*  and that's why I found it so fascinating. That was what was so appealing to me, it's like,
*  okay, this is a real one. Because there's not a lot of real ones. There's a lot of people that
*  pretend to be on these spiritual quests, but they really, they just want everybody to think
*  they're spiritual. It's like you were talking about the pleasure. What's the pleasure of owning
*  records? Well, the big pleasure was people coming over your house and think you're cool
*  because you have these records.
*  Jared That's the coolest record, man.
*  Pete That's the same thing with spirituality in a lot of ways. What people love is the fact that
*  someone finds out that you do yoga every day. Someone finds out that you meditate. Someone
*  finds out that you've read these books.
*  Jared The ego is so damn sneaky, isn't it?
*  Pete Oh, it's so sneaky. And sometimes it's fucking obvious as shit. Like, you know,
*  it's like a funny story. Brian Callan, when I first met him.
*  Jared He did Jiu Jitsu with us too.
*  Pete Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I love that guy to death. When I first met him, I went over his house. He
*  had an apartment in Venice, no doorknob. The doorknob had been broken out, so you could just open his
*  door and walk in. Anybody could open his door. And people would walk, like, he would come downstairs
*  and there was a homeless lady cooking in his kitchen. She goes, son, you got it going on.
*  And he was like, what? He's just eating my food. She was just cooking food in his house.
*  But I came over his house and he had a book. I forget what book it was. It was something
*  obvious, like Catcher in the Rye or something like that, sitting on his, I go,
*  it was just sitting on his coffee table. I go, you're not reading that book. I go,
*  you put that book out here so when girls come over they think you're smart. And he's like,
*  you're so right, I'm a fraud. And we were both howling and laughing. But that's a thing that
*  people do. Like, people want a well-stocked library, not just to read those books.
*  Read the books then. Read the books.
*  Yes, but it's also, there's an issue where people want people to think that you're this
*  brilliant, erudite, interesting person because you have all these books in your house.
*  Like, there's a factor in that.
*  They say the jiva or the spirit has to go through eight elements and each element to leave the
*  material universe is according to the yogis. And they get progressively double in size.
*  And the last one, so the first one is earth. And then that last one is ego. It's the hardest.
*  It's the biggest of all of them. And it's so refined. Even people, you do altruistic things.
*  You do things for your self-betterment. It gets wound up in religion. It gets wound up in diet.
*  It gets wound up in politics. It gets wound up in race. It gets wound up in animal rights. It gets
*  wound up against animal rights. The ego is the biggest thing. And you can sort of see it on a
*  person too. And almost better than seeing it on someone else is to see it on yourself. That's the
*  work of the yogi is try to see, man, I was motivated by that. Look, that was ill-motivated again.
*  So yeah, it's a constant checking in with the ego. I think that was part of my, I mean, think about
*  it. I came from sort of like a scene where everything, everybody had to be cool, a certain
*  way, there's a certain look, a certain dress, certain sneakers we wore, certain haircuts we
*  wore. And now I'm wearing a dopey robe. And I'm walking around and it don't, you know.
*  Pete Slauson How long were you a monk for?
*  Jared Sussman I was a monk for about six and a half years.
*  Pete Slauson Wow.
*  Jared Sussman Yeah. And it was a great time of life.
*  Pete Slauson How old were you?
*  Jared Sussman I was 22.
*  Pete Slauson So, from 22 to 28, you were a monk?
*  Jared Sussman I was a monk. That means celibate, no masturbating, nothing for seven and a half years.
*  Pete Slauson Where did you live?
*  Jared Sussman I lived in ashrams in India and in America. I traveled all over the world, actually.
*  Pete Slauson Wow.
*  Jared Sussman But it was, but I'll tell you what brought me to that place.
*  After being very materially frustrated, and I said those two main factors were some type of material
*  success. I wasn't the Beatles when I wasn't, you know, Michael Jackson, but I had some materials,
*  I had fans. And then realizing how life can get taken away from you in a moment with that precarious
*  place my father was at, it just made me start thinking, what the hell am I doing in this short
*  life? What am I supposed to do? Give me some GPS. Give me some, where do I go from here? What do I
*  want out of life? What is a home run? Is it to be very famous? Is that the home run? Is it to collect
*  tons of stuff? Is that a home run? Is to live a natural life? Is that a home run? Is to learn
*  some art, you know, some type of art? Is that a home run? And so, this was my burning question.
*  And I was still a New Yorker. I was still sort of like, you know, New York in the 80s. I was like a
*  little street smart New Yorker. I'm actually from Connecticut, but I started hanging out in New York
*  City. My parents were New Yorkers, and so we used to, my older brothers lived in the city, so I'd
*  visit them. But since the time I was 14, I used to just go to New York City and just hang out on the
*  weekends. And when I became a monk and went to India, I had saved about 25,000 bucks. Not a lot
*  of money, not tons of money, but it was, you know, some money I made. And I thought in my brain,
*  okay, this is my cynical self. I'm going to go to India, I'm going to meet a guru, the guru's going
*  to want all my money. This is how it works. But when I actually lived with the monks,
*  India, especially India then, 1988, there is no central AC, and it's hot. There's no heat,
*  and it's cold. In the winter, the showers are freezing because all the water's kept on a tank
*  on the roof of the ashram. In the summer, that water's super hot because it's all kept on a tank
*  on top of the ashram. There's no creature comforts whatsoever. You go to bed early,
*  you wake up super early. You go to bed, you know, 8.30. You wake up three o'clock in the morning.
*  There's nothing to buy, there's nothing to purchase. All the fun things that we like to
*  like ease the pain of existence are not there. You know, there's no movies, there's no television,
*  there's no comedy. There's nothing. And so two things happen when you strip everything away from
*  a person. They lose it, they hop the fence, so to speak, and I've seen that happen. Or they learn
*  to find their pleasure from something more subtle. And so when I first went there and saw the joy of
*  the monks, I realized they don't want my money. They don't want anything I have to offer them.
*  I want what they have. That was sort of a game changer moment for me. I want to figure out
*  how to be connected with nothing.
*  What did these guys do all day?
*  I don't know. They all did different stuff, I think.
*  Every ashram's got their own thing, you know what I mean?
*  Did you have chores that you had to do to earn your food?
*  Like, yeah, everybody, you know, every ashram is going to be different. And every spiritual path,
*  there's Christian monks and, you know, monks from different traditions around the world.
*  I'm sure they all got their thing, different things. But later I started doing my next band,
*  because the interesting thing about the Bhagavad Gita, the Bhagavad Gita is,
*  you're familiar with, it's one chapter of the biggest epic in the world, the Mahabharata.
*  And it's the most studied and discussed and commented on by all the saints of ancient India,
*  people even bringing it to politics and stuff. But it's a real conversation between the spirit
*  and divinity. It's a conversation about, just about, it's just considered ancient wisdom for
*  all people. So one of the ideas of the Gita is you don't give up what you're born to do.
*  You do what you do, but in a spiritual way. You don't try to like wipe out your desires,
*  it's not going to happen. You take what you do, and you do it in a way that is going to assist
*  you in your liberation and is going to assist everybody else. So I'll say I love comedy,
*  but I want comedy that uplifts me and not doesn't degrade me. I like entertainment,
*  that when I walk away from it, I learn something. I feel like I'm growing, I feel connected. I don't
*  want stuff that's going to just give me darker thoughts. Like the Joker? I've never seen it.
*  You didn't see it? I want to say that I live on a farm.
*  I live on a farm. I rarely watch anything except comedy. I love comedy, because I think laughing
*  is important. But I don't watch so much TV. So I'm pretty, if I do go to the movies, it's out of like,
*  with my wife, let's just, we want to get away from the kids, we want to do something.
*  Right. But there's no plan on what to watch. But I'm open to good ideas.
*  The Joker is a really good movie, but it's really dark.
*  It's really dark.
*  Like you walk out of there feeling really confused. Like you're like, did I like that?
*  I don't know if I like that. I know it was awesome. I know it was really well done,
*  but did I like that? And it's just, it's complicated. I mean, we could talk about
*  the Joker for the next two hours. So I don't get lost in the weeds.
*  The mind is like a garage, and you become like what you store in that garage. So the thoughts,
*  the thoughts that we put in the mind, we got to be careful with. The words.
*  Just we were talking about mantras before. The mantras are like repetitive sounds,
*  but they're considered transcendental sounds. So I chant the Hare Krishna mantra.
*  So the Krishna mantra, you might have known it from the soundtrack of Hare,
*  Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna, Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama, Rama,
*  Hare Hare. It's considered a transcendental sound for the mind. And it sort of connects
*  the soul with divinity. It doesn't matter what religion you are. It's considered a mantra
*  sound vibration that is a potency on the man. That's where they get the word mantra from.
*  It delivers the man or the mind. So what we store in the mind starts to create our external being.
*  And if you don't believe in it, it's one of those things. We have mantras in our mind anyway.
*  I have things on loop running through my mind that have been handed to me from parents, from
*  elementary school teachers, from a crazy uncle, for whatever. We get things handed to us,
*  and we play them on repeat. And sometimes they're mantras of self-deprecation,
*  self-loathing, you're not good enough. And these are the mantras running through the mind.
*  So the yoga system says, notice those mantras. That's part of self-edification or self-realization.
*  You notice what's playing in the mind, and you replace those mantras with transcendental sound,
*  or at the very least, training the mind to see greatness in people. That's a big thing.
*  Because the material mind wants to see, what are Joe's shortcomings? Because if I find your
*  shortcomings, it makes me feel better about myself. That's crazy thinking. If you've got
*  thousands of shortcomings, that doesn't make me better at all. So the material mind, which sees
*  one as so insecure that I have to lash out at other people to make myself feel whole. And it's
*  just crazy thinking, stinking thinking. Whereas the yogi trains, I specifically teach bhakti yoga,
*  which is called the yoga of connection or the yoga of the heart, and starts to deal with all the
*  essence of the teachings of the Gita, which is you train yourself to see greatness in other people.
*  And if I start to note, it's good, you could take this from a micro, like my relationship with you,
*  I want to notice all of Joe's great qualities. Now, when you hear that, you might think, well,
*  he doesn't really know me, I got some bad qualities. It immediately makes you a little
*  vulnerable. And you start to think, well, but you appreciate it. And anybody in our life who appreciates
*  us, sometimes they even see things in us we can't see in ourselves. We want to become like that.
*  That's why this idea of changing the world really starts with your self connection is I am a spiritual
*  being, Joe is a spiritual being. And I start to train myself in not seeing what Joe does wrong,
*  seeing everything he does right. It's a great exercise for the brain. What does that person do
*  right? What is the good in this person that I'm overlooking? Because I've got this lens,
*  it's a lens that we wear of trying to find shortcomings in people. And it screws people
*  up tremendously, even so-called spiritual people. I just had a roll. You can cork me anytime you want.
*  So you spent six and a half years living like this in this ashram, just trying to sort things out.
*  No, no sex, no masturbation. What are you eating? What kind of food they serve you?
*  Strict vegetarian diet. And not only that, the eye, this is an interesting point too.
*  And it's debated about in especially, you know, I was a raw foodist, so these raw foods, they're all
*  everyone's got their take on medicine and healing. Let me share the yogi perspective of it. Okay.
*  The missing ingredient in food, the vitamin, the superfood that is never spoken about is love.
*  Food is supposed to be grown, prepared, and then offered. And the offering is not even to a human,
*  the offering is to God. That's called prashad. Food is first called boga. Boga means it's for
*  enjoyment. And then you take that enjoyment, but before you enjoy it, you're offering it first
*  back like in sacrifice. The idea is that everything in this world is not for me.
*  Everything is, I'm not the center. I'm here to serve the center. So all the food takes on the
*  consciousness of the preparer of the food. So to eat junk food or to have people in very low
*  consciousness cooking your food, you're taking that into your body. You're taking the consciousness
*  of the preparer of the food. Do you believe that? I definitely believe it. Yeah. I definitely would
*  feel a tangible effect if I walked outside that line. So for years, I'd only eat food cooked by
*  Brahmins like the priests of the ashram, or I would cook it myself, or later, I have a very
*  weird story, which was I became a bunch of my friends that were monks. We started our own band
*  and we started a record label, a second record label in the ashram. I kid you not. It's almost
*  an unbelievable story. And perhaps the first time historically there was a celibate rock and roll
*  band, but this band ended up becoming bigger than the second band. This was my band Shelter.
*  So what happened was this band, when we started, though, we were all monks. And we would take a
*  candy stove on tour with us and we'd pull over the side of the road and we'd make khichri with rice
*  and dal and, you know, fenugreek and coriander and cumin. And we'd just cook because we wouldn't
*  eat outside food because if you did, you would feel it. You would feel it affect your mind.
*  Really? I kid you not. There's certain things like, I don't know. There's certain things that
*  they speak about in ancient Indian literature that I can say, maybe. I don't know. So you think
*  most people are just numb to that? I know. I definitely experienced that. I think most people
*  are just numb to that, numb to the effect of taking in the consciousness of someone who's on a low
*  vibration who's cooking your food. You're just numb to it. You just eat the food because you're
*  hungry. Or people- They are numb to it. The people that aren't aware of that concept.
*  Yeah, people aren't aware of the concept. I mean, that's the- For example, a home-cooked meal
*  definitely feels- Yes. Tastes better. Tastes different or feels different. Yeah. As opposed
*  to some guy just making burgers at White Castle or whatever. So I don't know. It depends on the-
*  But is this a perception or is it an actual energy? And does it matter?
*  I think it's both. It's almost like fire's going to burn whether I believe it or not.
*  But there is a concept of once you get that food, you don't eat the food. You honor the food.
*  So it's not going to be like me shoving stuff in my mouth, which I do occasionally,
*  if you've seen my eating habits. But it should be more of a- The eating itself should be a meditation.
*  And it's been proven. I'm not one of these guys- There's a thing that's- There's a similarity
*  that's going to seem like it's not a parallel. But in hunting, when you hunt an animal and you kill
*  that animal and you butcher that animal and then you feed it to your family, it sounds almost
*  hypocritical. It sounds like there's no way that would be a spiritual feeling. But there's a
*  connection to your food that's very, very different. Well, we've divorced ourselves from killing
*  animals for the most part. For the most part. Most people, higher people. Right. Most people
*  have no clue where their fruits come from, their vegetables come from. What a Brussels sprouts look
*  like when they grow. What a banana's look like when they grow. What is ground round? So we've
*  divorced ourselves from our food. And that's sort of- Anyway, I understand what you're saying.
*  We've definitely divorced ourselves from our food, but even agriculture, I'm sure if you raised
*  cattle and then killed them and ate them, you would feel differently than buying it in a supermarket.
*  But there's something even more intense about the quest of acquiring a wild animal. You're
*  going into this world. The first time I ever saw a wild deer that I was going to shoot,
*  I swear to God, it was like a psychedelic experience. I was like, I was looking in the
*  eyes of this thing in its world, this wild world in Montana. And I realized like, whoa, this is a
*  different dimension. Like I'm entering into this wild, this thing might not have ever seen a person
*  ever. And it's looking at me and I'm going to take its life and I'm going to eat it. But in the way
*  I was encountering this thing, because it was so intense and there was so many, it was nerve
*  racking. It was difficult. I was exhausted. We're in the mountains. We're trekking for hours and
*  hours and hours to try to get close to a deer. But the locking eyes with the deer, I was like,
*  oh, I didn't expect this. Like he saw you. He saw me and I saw him. But it was also,
*  there was a sharing of information. There was an acceptance of the roles that we both had
*  that made me realize that this is his life. This is how he does every day. Every day he's looking
*  at mountain lions and there's a wolf over there and there's a bear over here. I got to get the
*  fuck out of here. Like this is the existence. And that bringing that meat home was infinitely
*  more enjoyable than getting something from a store and also just felt differently. It gave me
*  gratitude. I had a connection to that animal and made me think about it every bite I took.
*  I didn't take any of it for granted. It meant a lot.
*  RG I wish that everybody that ate meat went out and hunted.
*  KS Yeah, it's just there's not enough animals. There's too many people. We fucked it already.
*  We fucked it already with cities. We fucked it already with large scale agriculture. We fucked
*  it already with monocropping. We fucked it already with you being able to buy food any way you want.
*  This is the reason why there's so many of us. RG Like the end of the world, Joe?
*  KS It's not the end of the world. It's a new world. It's I mean, obviously right now, ready?
*  Everything's fine. Feel it? Feel that? Everything's fine. We're in this room.
*  It's sustainable. I mean, people look at it in terms of they extrapolate like if this happens
*  and that happens, we keep going. Oh my God, it's going to be awful in 10, 15 years. Guess what?
*  They thought that when the car came out, they thought that when the printing press was invented,
*  they thought that when people stepped out of the caves and started building huts. This has always
*  been the case with people. We're terrified of change. I'm not terrified that the world is
*  ending, that it's unsustainable. We have problems. We have challenges for sure. But one of the big
*  ones is that we're divorced from nature in a very, very strange way. And most people
*  are urban population centers. Most people don't encounter nature. If you're in Manhattan,
*  your best bet is Central Park, which is the most bastardized zoo like form of nature you're ever
*  going to find. It's not real nature. Like where you live, you live in upstate.
*  S1 You got bears, you got foxes.
*  KS You have real nature. That's real nature. Do you guys have ticks? Do you get Lyme disease?
*  S1 I don't have Lyme disease, but it's a serious thing.
*  KS It's a huge thing.
*  S1 It's a huge thing. And I pulled off many ticks. I've got the bullseyes on my arms.
*  KS And you get antibiotics right away?
*  S1 Yeah.
*  KS Yeah, you got to. They're fuckers.
*  S1 And a lot of kids have Lyme disease where I live.
*  KS A lot of people have it. It's terrible.
*  S1 It's horrible.
*  KS They said there's some area of the East Coast where something like 60% of all the ticks.
*  S1 Lyme, Connecticut.
*  KS Well, yeah, that too. Yeah. You know, a lot of people think that that was initially some sort of
*  biological weapon.
*  S1 I heard.
*  KS Yeah.
*  S1 You ever get to the bottom? I figured if anyone knows, you do.
*  KS I don't think anybody's gotten to the bottom of it, but there's enough inquiry that serious
*  people have started researching this. And there's enough real concern that that was the original
*  origin of it. That it really was some sort of a biological weapon that escaped from a lab.
*  Because there's no doubt that they've invented biological weapons. No doubt they've experimented
*  on different ways to fuck people up. And one of them is mass illness and sickness. I mean,
*  it's just a fantastic way. Especially if you have an immunity, if you're vaccinated, you can
*  expose other people to it. They had a vaccine for Lyme disease, but it wasn't effective. Not only was
*  it not effective, it actually gave people Lyme disease. In fact, my manager's dad got Lyme disease
*  from the vaccine for Lyme disease. Yeah, fun times. Yeah. Like, boy, I don't want to get this
*  Lyme disease. Better get vaccinated. And then all of a sudden, why do my joints hurt? How come my
*  knees are in fucking pain every day? How come I can't walk right? Well, you know, when I lived out
*  here, you just have to actively look for nature. We used to go to Stony Point. Remember that place?
*  Sure. Topanga. And I used to take my kids when they were little, all the way down, victory. I
*  think victory dead ends. And then there's all those mountains up there. Yep. Victory. Yeah.
*  You just got to make like a plan. And I will say when people come up to our farm, you know,
*  we run a retreat center. And when people come up there, the first thing they think is, oh my god,
*  the stars. It's like, you're divorced from the moon and the stars. Yeah, that's the stars are big,
*  man. I remember the first time I went to Hawaii, I went to the Keck Observatory in the Big Island.
*  And we went up there. And we got out of the car. And it was like you're in a spaceship,
*  like you're in a spaceship, and you're looking out a giant window. And there's nothing else,
*  just space like a movie. You see the full Milky Way and all the stars. It's spectacular up there.
*  And this is one of the reasons why they have the observatory up there because it's really high.
*  It's like where we were was not the very top. There's the top and then there's a visitor center.
*  That's right. Yeah, the visitor center, I think is like, I want to say like 10,000 feet or something
*  like that. But then you get even further up, like 12, 13. And then you hit the where they have the
*  telescopes up there on the Big Island. It's fucking amazing. It's amazing. If you get up there on a
*  clear night when there's no moon, which is what we got really lucky, because I've been back since
*  one time was cloudy. And the other time we fucked up and got up there. It was a full moon. And just
*  wasn't the same wasn't the same. But when it was no moon, man, it was spectacular, like life changing.
*  Like like you look at it, and all of a sudden you have a fresh perspective like, oh, we're
*  a part of the infinite. There's a spiritual experience you get when you just throw yourself
*  under the stars. You're like, oh, I get it. Yes, I'm tiny. I thought I was big.
*  But that's a that's a real symptom. It's a real issue and a real cause of why we're so disconnected
*  and why we're so egocentric. And so we're not humbled. Like, here's here's an example. Where do
*  when you think about people that are humbled, like cool people, you think of two things, you think of
*  people live by the ocean. And you think of people live in the mountains, because those people are
*  confronted by undeniable evidence of the majesty of nature. Undeniable, like, I'm tiny. Yes,
*  I'm part of something much bigger. You're also you're surrounded by like, I lived in the mountains
*  outside of Boulder for a while. And when you're driving up there, you're you're confronted with
*  undeniable, spectacular beauty that really is fuck every painting that everyone's ever made.
*  It's all a no cap mountains with a lake and just trees and you see a deer bouncing across the road.
*  You see a fox like, fuck, this is amazing. I mean, it just changes your physical state to look at
*  you like, Whoa, like no artwork could ever do. But we don't think of it like that. We just think of,
*  oh, there's the mountains. Well, there's something about beauty, right? There's physical beauty in
*  terms of like, you see a woman that's beautiful, and you're looking at symmetry, and you're looking
*  at genetics. And there's something that's attractive about that because of your DNA, right?
*  You're you want to breed with this person, because this person has beautiful symmetry,
*  and they're attracted. But there's another kind of beauty. There's a physical beauty in nature,
*  that's spectacular, that doesn't serve any real purpose for you. Like, why do you feel that way?
*  Why are you enamored by this, the vision of this glacial river running down through these mountains
*  and seeing these birds fly around and eagle soars over? Why is that so spectacular? Why is it so
*  attractive? That's, I don't know, but whatever it is, there's a feeling that you get when you
*  encounter those things that's unlike any other feeling. And we are divorced from that feeling.
*  It's one of the best feelings that a human being can get when you can sit down. Like, one of the
*  best best things about hunting is just sometimes like you take a break, and you sit down on a ridge,
*  and you're just drinking water, and just looking out like, fuck, right? This place is amazing.
*  It's just amazing. You ever do the Grand Canyon? Yeah, I've been, but not since I was a kid. Yeah,
*  yeah. Another one of those things. It's like, is this even real? Yeah, I know. I mean, but you know
*  what? I used to have a bit about the Grand Canyon, about people telling you, oh my God,
*  you have to go. You have to go. The Grand Canyon is so amazing. I go, yeah. You know what's amazing?
*  That. Look up. Look up. Above you is infinity. You're looking at a fucking ditch. You're looking at
*  a tiny ditch. Like, oh, good. You can see the bottom. It's a pretty good fit. Look up. Look up.
*  You're in fucking space. It's actually quite unbelievable. Space is the ultimate one,
*  but that is the one that we're most divorced from. So think about the beauty of seeing nature
*  and trees and lakes and seeing fish jump and amazing. The beauty that I got from seeing the
*  sky from the Keck Observatory with no moon, just all stars, it was just like humbling, just humbling
*  beyond words, like reset my idea of where I fit in and where earth fits in, where people fit in,
*  and made me feel in a weird way, at least temporary before it wears off because it's just,
*  you know, normal conditioning, temporarily more connected to people. I felt more, more in tune
*  with people, more like we are in this together. We're all, we all need to help each other because
*  we're all flying through infinity. And any, at any point in time, a rock could just come down here
*  and slam into this fucking planet. Take a quarter of the planet away. Yeah. Like just like it did
*  with the dinosaurs. Yeah. And kill us all. It looks like it has done multiple times throughout
*  history and they're constantly recognizing these new areas where impact craters happened 70,000
*  years ago. Yeah, they're always finding them. They're always finding them and they're like,
*  oh, geez, look at this. And no one, no one, no one prepared for it. No, we can't. You know,
*  there's still these reductionist scientists, these guys, you'll talk to them like, we have a solution,
*  we could stop it. We could do this. We could do that. But then you talk to the real hardcore
*  people that actually study the complications involved in deflecting asteroids and this stuff.
*  And they're like, no, we need years. We need years and years and years of planning. If we find
*  something coming our way, we know it's coming at us. We need all the best minds in the world. And
*  it still might take a decade to figure out how to do something about this. Well, and then we might
*  see the other one that's coming behind the sun. We might not see one that's coming from a director
*  that we're not observing. But when you can't, how about when you can't perceive? Yeah. Yeah.
*  There's a lot of those too. We don't even know. We don't even know what we can't perceive. Right.
*  Yeah. But the vulnerability that comes from that feeling is also very freeing. It's not a bad
*  vulnerability. It's the vulnerability that I got from looking off in the space didn't make me sad
*  or scared. It made me in awe. Yeah. I felt better. I'm, uh, my kids went to a Waldorf school.
*  Yeah. Yeah. My oldest kid went to one in Boulder when we were really there. Yeah. So they went there,
*  some graduated from there and, um, my kids went there. They've been homeschooled for the last two
*  years, but there's a strong, now they go to this, this survival homeschool camp. Oh, really? Yeah.
*  It's, they make fire by friction. They're outdoors like all day long. Flying deer. I'll just give it
*  a plug right now. Flyingdeer.com.org. But, um, they're outside all day long, like nine o'clock
*  in the morning, three o'clock in the afternoon. Wow. They're built. It doesn't matter what the
*  weather is. It's like, I'd even drop them off like in the rain. I was like, I'm so sorry, but get out.
*  But you know, they become resilient. They become strong. And you know what they do when they come
*  home? Them and all their friends. I've got 13 kids. It's like 50 degrees out. They're playing
*  outside in the drizzle barefoot and they're just like strong and happy and connected kids.
*  Yeah. They get used to it.
*  They get used to it. And I become like a
*  domesticated dog. Yeah. Right? Where it's sort of like, you know, they're not wolves.
*  Right. They're domesticated dogs. They like their food from a jar or from a bag.
*  Like Marshall. You meant Marshall. Is he domesticated?
*  Oh my God. What do you think? He's as domesticated as you get.
*  That dog is the sweetest thing that's ever lived.
*  Oh, like Marshall, your dog. Yeah, Marshall.
*  The dog out there. I thought you meant one of the guys that worked here.
*  I didn't explain it. I was like, is he domesticated?
*  No, no, no. I'm sorry. Yes, that dog is...
*  The golden retriever. Yeah, he's well kept.
*  He's the sweetest of sweetie pies. Sure.
*  But that is a domesticated animal. I know.
*  When it rains out, he gets outside and he's like, hmm.
*  I had coyotes come into my property and I'm sheep. And so I got my dog all riled. Come on,
*  let's get those coyotes to see him. I ran outside. The dog is just like, goes back inside.
*  Yeah, you got to get a dog who's used to coyotes, just like your kids are used to the outdoors.
*  You got to get a dog who knows the coyote is an enemy.
*  I'm reliving my childhood. That's interesting.
*  Through my kids. How far away are you from civilization up there?
*  You know, the cool thing is not that far. If I need to go to an Apple store or something,
*  it's like an hour to Albany. That's not bad.
*  Yeah. Two and a half from Boston. Oh, you're only two and a half hours from Boston.
*  And two and a half from New York City. Oh, that's not bad.
*  Yeah, Super Soul Farm. And yeah, it's, we do like our yoga workshops and things there.
*  So do people travel to you? People travel to us. We have weekends.
*  We have a whole second, you know, 5,000 square foot house for guests, a yoga studio on the property.
*  Oh, that's amazing. It is cool.
*  Got a swim pond. Wow.
*  Something cool about when it's hot out, like it does get in the East Coast,
*  you can just jump in a pond. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
*  But you also get parasites. Be real careful. Don't drink any of that water.
*  I drink it, man. It comes right from the mouth and I drink spring water.
*  Okay. Well, you're pretty high up then. Are you high up?
*  There's nothing above me. Okay.
*  Yeah. Then you're all right. Sort of in a valley and it comes right from the hill.
*  The real issue is beavers. Yeah. If something dies above, I get it.
*  Well, it's shit too. It's beaver fever. You get giardia.
*  Right. I drank out of a lake in Alaska and I was like really tentative.
*  I want to drive out of the lake. You can because this lake is a glacial
*  lake or excuse me, it's a high elevation lake and there's no beavers of that altitude.
*  It was on Prince of Wales Island and you can actually dip your thermos into this lake
*  and drink it and it's the cleanest, clearest water you've ever seen. It tastes perfect.
*  Exciting. Yeah.
*  It's actually exciting. Yeah.
*  I think when I first moved to the East Coast, I was just looking up different springs. Saratoga
*  spring is a great place. There's just all these natural healing springs.
*  You should test that water before you drink it though.
*  They're probably- Just bring it to someone to shake that
*  bitch up. There are ones that are just coming out of the side of a hill that I just go to.
*  Yeah, you can. On a regular basis.
*  We have an artesian well on our property, which means it's just naturally coming up or
*  artesian. I got to get the wiki on that one, but I think it's the pressure of
*  the pressure of the downward push is forcing it up.
*  What is the word? Yeah. Artesian, I always see it used in terms of like handcrafted things.
*  Artesian? Yeah. It's like an artisan.
*  That's artisan. That's artisan.
*  Artesian work. I think that's artisan.
*  I'm sure I'm fucking this up.
*  There's a bit of a struggle there. What is that cover of your phone?
*  Oh, this is our podcast we do, Wisdom of the Sages.
*  Oh, you have a podcast too. Everybody has a fucking podcast.
*  I'm waiting for my mom to start one up. Wisdom of the Sages.
*  It was born out of an hour. A daily podcast.
*  Okay. It was born out of an-
*  Artesian, relating to or detonating a well bored perpendicularly into water bearing strata,
*  lang. I hate when I read something that makes less sense.
*  At an angle so that natural pressure- I think you were kind of getting it though.
*  Natural pressure produces a constant supply of water with little or no pumping.
*  The water from an artesian well. Okay, so I was fucking it up with artisan.
*  I was connecting the two of them. I spelled it that way when I looked at it first.
*  That's A-R-T-I-S-A-N. This is A-R-T-E-S-I-A-N.
*  Yeah, the place that I lived down in Boulder had a well. It was amazing.
*  You'd get this beautiful spring water straight out of the ground.
*  It's just incredible. All your water that you drank was just perfect spring water to come out
*  of these copper pipes. It's great.
*  There it goes. Artisanal versus artesian. Artisan is pronounced artisan.
*  A person skilled at an applied art. That's what you have. A crafts person.
*  Yes. Describes water with spouts out of the earth under natural pressure. That's it.
*  Yeah. And so sometimes these old houses in upstate New York or Massachusetts have
*  water that's just coming up and they build a tank in the house to hold this water.
*  Yeah. It's a great way to get water.
*  If you think that's going in your body, on your body, in your skin,
*  in your mouth, it's becoming you. As long as no one's fracking nearby.
*  That's a problem. It's a giant issue.
*  It's a massive problem. Have you ever seen that movie Gasland?
*  No. It's a great movie to
*  really get you angry. It's heartbreaking.
*  Because there's people in Pennsylvania that I was just reading a story about recently
*  where they can't drink their water. They can't shower with their water. They have to get bottled
*  water or they travel someone else's house to shower. It's fracking horrific.
*  It's heartbreaking.
*  Yeah. They poisoned the water supply with this desire to get oil. But on the other hand,
*  we don't need Middle East oil anymore. So everybody's like, look, the United States
*  produces, we're self-sustaining. We no longer need the Middle Eastern oil. But yeah, but
*  what about these fracking people that can't drink their water or it comes out of the
*  spout and they could light it on fire?
*  My teacher, Radnath Swami, who you would love on the show, he wrote a great book. If you ever
*  want to read a good sort of a modern day autobiography of a yogi, it's about a Jewish kid in the
*  60s travels hitchhikes from London to India.
*  Wow. You can do that?
*  Yeah. For the most part, you can. You got to go through Afghanistan, all these tough
*  Ooh.
*  Khyber Pass and he hits
*  Turkey or Afghanistan. That's gangster.
*  It's super gangster, man. He had a good, he had a great experience, but it's an all real adventure
*  too. And he ends up in India living in the Himalayas with Sadhus.
*  Wow.
*  Incredible. Incredible stories called auto bug.
*  A journey home autobiography of an American yogi.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah. I want to talk to that guy. You could hook me up with him.
*  Yeah. He's great. I spend a month with him every January.
*  We do a teacher training, a yoga training in India every January. I just got back from it.
*  Yeah. I saw it on your Instagram.
*  It's great. It's super fun. We do, we have three academies. We have a music school where we study
*  Indian music in Kirtan. We have a 300 hour training for people who are already teachers.
*  And we have a sacred literature. She studied the Bhagavad Gita and all these sacred texts.
*  We were talking about that before the podcast. I really wanted to get into that eventually. I just
*  know how to like the, the, the mystical aspects of the Bhagavad Gita and of the Mahabharata,
*  all the ancient Indian texts, which are filled with really wild out there shit, you know, I mean.
*  It's all real. All that crazy stuff is real.
*  In what way?
*  Just like all the things that you say, like, oh, that's interesting. That's fast. Fascinating.
*  That's fantastic. The more you get into it, you realize that's fricking real.
*  Like what? Like what's real?
*  Everything from like.
*  The Vimanas.
*  Vimanas. Things like that. I can't say are real, but I could, I could understand how things can be
*  made of subtle energy.
*  Well, explain Vimanas.
*  Vimanas is like a spaceship. It's like, it's a spaceship from,
*  and they speak of spaceships and flying crafts, but they're not made of the same elements of this
*  earth. So we have all these things about, you know, and I get it. There's a bunch of people
*  making up shit about, about, uh, I saw an alien, et cetera, but there's also very qualified people,
*  you know, air force colonels and things like that. I said, I've had them in here.
*  You had them in. Yeah. They said, well, what can I, and they, they suffer from the same thing.
*  These people who claim abduction, it's not like a type of, uh, neurosis or schizo, they suffer from
*  like post-traumatic stress syndrome. Like they, something happened, they disappear. They were
*  found two weeks later. Do you remember the story of Betty and Barney Hill? No. It's the most famous
*  abduction story. It was an interracial couple from, I think it was the 1950s or the 1960s.
*  And, uh, just random, my interviews always go here. I had this girl on the podcast, this woman
*  on the podcast yesterday. Uh, she's an MMA fighter. Her name was Angela Hill. Uh, she's a couple days
*  ago, actually, um, uh, this bad-ass MMA fighter. And at the end of the podcast, she goes, I forgot
*  to bring this up. My grandfather is Barney Hill. I was like that guy. I'm like, no fucking way.
*  That guy, Barney Hill was the very first like really public UFO abductee and there's record,
*  and he describes his craft that's eerily similar to the crafts that Bob Lazar has described and
*  different people described. And he and his wife lost time while they were driving and then
*  woke up with these bizarre, horrific memories that they both shared of this encounter with these
*  space beings and that they were abducted and they were, uh, medical examinations were run on them.
*  Then they were replaced with missing time. And it's crazy. If you listen to the recordings of him
*  being hypnotized and going through it, like screaming in fear that they're touching him
*  and where are they taking him? What are they doing to him? It's not like a guy acting. It's
*  not like a scene in a movie where someone's screaming in fear. It sounds real. And I just-
*  The teachings of ancient India is that life exists on all planets. It even exists on the sun. And so
*  the first argument would be like, come on, how are we going to exist? They just still have bodies
*  that are different than yours. They have a fire body. And therefore I'm trying to look at- how
*  does a person with earth and water body live in the sun? They can't. You have to have a body.
*  I mean, I used to think like this when I was 13 years old. I used to think like, okay,
*  why can my dog hear those sounds but I can't hear them? What am I missing? What sense am I missing
*  that I can't have objective reality? What am I missing? Am I missing a sense?
*  Well, I have this principle called the fart theory. Like if someone farted but you didn't
*  have a nose, you'd have no idea. You'd have no idea?
*  You'd have no idea. You'd be like, oh, God, what is that?
*  That fart theory is the beginning of transcendental thought.
*  Yeah, because there's a sense that you possess that allows you to
*  access- Yeah, recognize something that's invisible. You can't see it. You can't feel it. You can't
*  hold it. There's no way of detecting it other than your olfactory senses. But through your nose,
*  you can detect that something's awful. What sense am I missing that's keeping me
*  from understanding absolute reality? Sure. I mean, that's one of the things that you
*  feel when you take psychedelics. Like, is this opening up some new sense that I wasn't- I mean,
*  is this around me all the time? I'm just not tuned into it because I don't have the right
*  chemical composition flowing through my brain? When I start to teach a bigger training,
*  like a yoga training and philosophy, that's one of the things I do mainly.
*  I start with this concept of this is how you understand- like when I first approached
*  teachers when I went to India, I would say things like, you know, I'm reading this Mahabharata.
*  I think it's a great book, a lot of great lessons here. But come on, we're adults.
*  Are I supposed to understand that an elephant-headed man scribed this entire book? Can't we just extract
*  a useful lesson? And the answer was very good that I got was- and it was very sweet. It wasn't,
*  like, cruel. He just said, what do you know? It sort of like caught me off guard. Like,
*  what do you actually know? Right. What do you know? And I- and he used this example. You're
*  from New York? Okay. Suppose 300 years ago you're living in New York, your family's living in New
*  York, your tribe is living in New York, you have a certain amount of animals and animals that you
*  keep, animals that you ride, animals that you hunt, foods you eat, and then one of you goes on a boat
*  to Africa. And you come back and you think, you're never going to believe what I saw. I saw a striped
*  horse. You're thinking, well, I've seen striped horses. White head, black neck. No, no, no, no.
*  I saw a striped horse. If you've never seen a zebra, it's almost unbelievable if all you know is
*  ponies. Right. Or I saw this horse with a really long neck that ate the leaves on the trees.
*  Come on, man. It's all fantastic because we've never seen it. Right. But that doesn't mean it
*  doesn't. So to really understand the Vedas, the teachings of ancient India, you have to go into it
*  like, not that it's all real. I'm not saying they're just blind faith, but I'm not saying don't be a
*  blind doubter. Like it's all unreal. That's bullshit. That's crazy. That's nuts. It's got to be,
*  could be. I don't know, but I don't know a lot. What do you think the elephant- what do you think
*  like Ganesh was? Ganesh is a being. By the way, when I speak, I'm speaking, it's not my feelings,
*  whether I'm right or wrong. I'm seeing this is what the- I'm a yoga teacher. So I teach what the
*  yogis teach. Ganesh is a being. He's a jiva. Jiva means he's a soul. Like in India, they say,
*  you don't have a soul. You are a soul. You have a body. So the bodies change, but the soul is
*  eternal. So that's called the jiva-tattva. You understand that you're separate than your-
*  we are separate than our bodies. We are set, like you said earlier, we're separate from our thoughts,
*  we're separate from our subtle body, our mind. So you take on a different Rogan machine, a Raghunath
*  machine. And sometimes the machines are good at warfare, fighting. Sometimes the machines are
*  good at art. Sometimes the machines, they're just like a different vehicle you would drive.
*  You got a Porsche or you got an 18-wheeler. They're both good for different things.
*  So in the same way, we have some karma. These are karma ties. And you have some karma to have this
*  body that has such good fortune or poor fortune or some great success. And it's the karma of the
*  body, but you have to leave that body. So Ganesh is also a post. Brahma is also a post. You could
*  have been a Brahma in a previous life or could be one in a previous life. And you get a body,
*  just like you get a body in this life, according to how you act and how you behave and how you
*  think and the people you associate with, they give you a body. For example, if you and I
*  grow up together and all we talk about is martial arts, we got pictures of Arnold Schwarzenegger on
*  our wall. We start to create a body that emulates those heroes. And if we couldn't care less,
*  and we just like watching TV and do nothing, we get a body according to... So in this lifetime,
*  we're making bodies and we're making our minds, we're making our intelligence. But the yogis say
*  that everything that we do is a practice. Just like, I just found out today that you were a
*  Tae Kwon Do champion by reading your bio. Oh, you read my bio? I read your bio on Wikipedia.
*  I was like, I gotta know more. So I just know you from just rolling around with you,
*  that type of camaraderie. So you got that way from a practice. It didn't just like spontaneously
*  come, you practiced. And you bring that practice with you wherever you go. And you can get better
*  at the practice or you can get a little down in the practice. But the yogis say that everything
*  that we do is a practice. It's our thoughts, our intelligence, our skills, our spirituality,
*  our addictions. They don't just fall from the sky, we work on them. And that's why there's these
*  things, which is another thing. I don't know if you've ever done this on your show, study the lives
*  of... What are they called? Savants or like these prodigies. It's unbelievable. Four years old
*  musical prodigies. Like where's that coming from? The yogis say, it's not random, it's not weird,
*  it's not quirky, it's not unexplainable, it's a practice. Or what was that child chess player
*  from Norway who could play like six people backwards and beat them and he was not facing
*  them. He's memorizing their board. Where do you get that type of intelligence? The yogis say,
*  it's a practice. Or Mozart and Chopin who are like virtuosos at four. How? And you'll see like the
*  saints of India, they'll be spiritual virtuosos. Like from a very early age, like my teacher's
*  teacher's teacher, like a grandfather teacher, he was like a master of Sanskrit at age four.
*  Whoa.
*  And could give class on it. Imagine that at age four?
*  Getting sense for classes at age four.
*  You know what I was doing at age four? I was wrecking shit. I was breaking things.
*  Yeah, lighting things on fire.
*  You know, Shankaracharya, another great like teacher of India, age eight, he renounced the
*  world at eight, initiated 10,000 disciples, changed the course of all of India.
*  At eight?
*  At eight. He wrote commentaries. You can go to Columbia University, read commentaries in the
*  Gita by this person who at age eight walked away from his mother and said, I'm leaving for the
*  forest. It's unbelievable. This stuff's real. You find this. And I told you, when you go to,
*  one of the fun things I do usually is I do that school in January, the academy. But in October,
*  in autumn time, I do a pilgrimage where we go to holy places. And I take students like 30 or 40
*  students to holy places. And we just meet interesting, cool people. We go to temples,
*  we'll go to sacred places. We sing. It's fun. At the very least, it's like a fun experience,
*  but it's also like very transformational. And you just meet the most fascinating people.
*  It's still there. India's changed dramatically since I went there in 88.
*  How so?
*  Oh man. It's like the whole, you know, I mean, there was no phones.
*  You want a phone, you go to the village, there's one phone in the village, you know.
*  And also because when the internet came, you know, if you think about India,
*  it's such an interesting place. Like when Greece was in its infancy, India was like
*  a respected hub of learning, metaphysics, spirituality, et cetera.
*  So India, it's been invaded by moguls, by British, by Portuguese. So many different
*  cultures came there and they can never really quite change it. It was so woven into their DNA,
*  what they were. Nothing changed it until my lifetime. And I watched it. I watched when
*  cable TV hit India. And it was paradigm shifting. Because you got to think, you know, people dress,
*  you know, you go to Germany in the 80s, people dress different. You go to Italy in the 80s,
*  people dress different. I mean, there was no like globalization of now it doesn't matter. You go to
*  Paris, Beverly Hills, Scranton, Pennsylvania, there's the same Victoria's Secret, there's the
*  same Gap. Oh, you don't want to dress like Gap, well, we got this other store you could dress like.
*  And they're just selling us sort of the same thing. People used to go places for spices,
*  places for silk, places, right? India was sort of like that too. You went there and you feel like,
*  I'm on another freaking planet. And now you got to dig a little deeper to find that. That's why I
*  recommend people go as soon as possible because everything is going to, I mean, we're in the valley
*  right now. And there's one point up on one of these streets up here, we went to Follow Your Heart
*  yesterday. Have you ever been to that restaurant? Yeah, sure. Love that place. It's a great place.
*  Follow Your Heart. Great little grocery store too. Great grocery store. But there's one little tiny
*  block where it looks like the valley from 1950. And then there's massive high rises around it.
*  And so we've, in our lifetime, we've watched places just get paved over. And it gets, sometimes for
*  the better and sometimes for the worse. But truthfully, there is a disconnect with nature
*  often. Even sometimes in the, it's better now. That disconnect with nature, I sort of just like,
*  I feel more connected. I mean, now I take people on pilgrimage and we stay at hotels and
*  it's definitely not like the old days when I used to slum it in the ashrams.
*  But I miss that slum in it too. I miss sort of like just being out there in the elements when it
*  was freezing and there was no heat, you were forced to take a cold shower, you had no,
*  there was no creature comforts. You took a bus. And you enjoy it now looking back on it. I enjoyed
*  it then. Yeah. There's something pleasurable in renunciation. I bet you could identify with that.
*  When you have to do something that you don't want to do for a higher purpose, but you're going to do
*  it anyway, there's a pleasure you get. This is a giant roundabout we went to, but I want to get
*  back to Ganesh. Oh yeah, sorry about that. So what do you think Ganesh is? They're higher beings.
*  Now you might say, well, what the hell does that mean, a higher being? The idea in the
*  in Vedic thought is that there's devas or higher beings. And then there's the devati-deva,
*  like a Jinao Christian tradition would say God. How much of what these people are experiencing
*  and talking about in the Bhagavad Gita and all the texts has to do with soma and has to do with
*  psychedelic rituals that they were participating in while they were doing these things?
*  How do you know about soma? So funny. I can't believe you said that.
*  Yeah, it's a commonly known thing, I think. Soma is a beverage on the moon.
*  Oh, okay, the moon. Makes sense. But it's a beverage.
*  Right, but it's a combinatorial beverage, a psychedelic sacrament that we haven't established.
*  By the way, I'm speaking like a matter of fact. I understand.
*  I don't know this. I'm saying it could be true and this is what they teach. So
*  that's how we learn the Vedas. What are the ingredients?
*  It's otherworldly. You can't try to recreate it on earth. There's plants, they say, that grow,
*  that don't grow here. And there's beings that grow. Now we just hear these stories and it's myth.
*  But you know what? The zebra's a myth. I live around a bunch of beautiful turkeys.
*  But if you've ever seen a peacock, turkeys look like boring. You know what I mean?
*  Peacocks are unbelievable. A quetzal is unbelievable.
*  I don't know what a quetzal is.
*  Quetzal is a South American bright colors, what's his name?
*  A crazy bird?
*  Montezuma wore his feathers on his hat. So if all you know is Robbins, an occasional cardinal,
*  when you see a quetzal or a peacock, it's like, what the fuck?
*  So someone could say, well, you're really going to believe in the wind god? Come on.
*  But we say, hey, look, there's an ant on the table and I blow on the ant.
*  The ant runs for his life. In the ant's brain, he's not thinking, oh, Raghu is blowing on me.
*  He's just thinking, danger, danger, danger. Yeah, I'm actually, I'm a being. I'm a being with a
*  family, with ideas, with thoughts, with a home. So the yogis say, you don't know, but they say
*  that everything is a personality. Not just you, because in one sense, if I look at you,
*  you're just a big lump of earth and flesh, you know, water, blood, whatever you, whatever you
*  want to, whatever lens you want to look, the periodic table, earth, the Chinese elements,
*  Indian elements, however they're going to look at matter. But you're not, the yogis say you're not
*  that. You just have that. So they say the earth itself is a being, it's a living being. And all
*  the animals are living beings. And outside of the earth, there are living forces. All the planets
*  are beings. That's why there's, here's, get ready for a detour. That's why if you study Jyotish or
*  Vedic astrology, there's different mantras to the different planets, because the planets affect your
*  karma. So some people want to, they realize, man, like, I would love to get your chart done.
*  Mm.
*  Because when you have people like yourself, or even myself on a lesser level, where we have some
*  types of extremes in our life, you can read it in their chart. It becomes very obvious.
*  Same with criminals. It's in their chart.
*  Really?
*  If you really knew how little control we have of our life, it's shocking.
*  Now, this, what kind of astrology is this?
*  They call it Jyotish or Vedic astrology.
*  And it's based on…
*  And I'm no astrologer. I just have had my charts done a lot. It's an ancient system. It's not
*  based on the sun. It's based on the moon.
*  And what do they need to know in order to do your chart?
*  They need to know your birth time, your longitude and latitude of where you're born. Like, for
*  example, I was born on, I'll tell you a good story. Do you mind?
*  Sure.
*  I went to a great astrologer once. And these guys were real, like, simple, humble, like, humble
*  people. And he lived in an ashram. And I said, I want to know my chart. And he just said,
*  I'm not very good. I said, come on, I've heard you're the best. He said, I'm not very good.
*  And he said, but I will tell you what Parashara thinks of you.
*  Now, Parashara was the father of the person they say scribed or spoke all the Vedas,
*  Vyasadeva, who was one of the great sages of India. So Parashara was his father, and he's
*  responsible for Jyotish or what's called the horror sastras, where they get the word horoscope
*  from. And these are all to do with studying the luminary, studying celestial bodies, and to
*  pinpoint you in relationship to them. So he said, well, at a certain period when you were born,
*  there was a rising star. And from that star, we can calculate your chart.
*  So he asked, I gave him all my statistics, birth time and date and longitude and latitude.
*  And then he opened up these books that he had on his shelf. This guy doesn't know me from Adam.
*  He just goes, this is the star of music and spirit, and you will spread music and spirit
*  throughout the world. Whoa. It's pretty right on. I've been through some very powerful astrologers,
*  palm readers, mystics who don't even need your palm. They say they're astrologers or they say
*  they're palm readers. They look right in your face and tell you all about your life.
*  And I'm not one. I've met many who could blow your mind.
*  You have to be someone who doesn't know who I am.
*  Yeah. Well, it's harder for you, but I'm less known. But in India, no one knows you anyway.
*  But I don't want to have to go to India.
*  You know, it's one of those things. And I'm not one of these new age guys.
*  Right. I'm a New York skeptic.
*  Okay. But you believe in Ganesh.
*  But I believe Ganesh could be. Could he be? Sure. Sure he could be.
*  I think most likely people were taking Soma and Ganesh appeared to them then.
*  Or that could happen too.
*  I've seen things on psychedelic experiences that are very similar to that, very similar to a god.
*  I think psychedelia can bring you into this otherworldly realms. And even according to the
*  Vedic concept is there's other realms and everything's divine and everything's a person
*  and there's 33 million gods. And then of course out, and that's within the material universe.
*  Right.
*  And the material universe has higher planets. It has lower planets like the Christians would say
*  hell. But they talk about whole mandalas or disks of layers of hells. But the differences
*  from Christianity, and I don't know where the Christians actually got it from or when it was
*  added or subtracted, but the Vedas teach about none of them are eternal, meaning you don't stay
*  there. Just like we don't stay here. We're just sort of doing time on this planet. We do time.
*  We're learning a lesson. You get some karma. You get some good or bad karma. And if you don't
*  learn your lesson, just like jail, if you don't learn your lesson, sometimes you get added,
*  an added sentence. What do they call that? You get two life sentences.
*  But sometimes people are out early. They get paroled, they get pardoned, or they get,
*  or they just say, okay, you're in charge of the library. You're not dangerous. You're not
*  a threat. And we're going to let you out your good behavior. So according to how we behave in this
*  world, we're perpetuating ourselves. We're going way low. We're sort of go high and people go high
*  all the time. It's impressive. And you take that micro and put it on a macro as well. And to the
*  degree that you sort of don't learn your lessons, you just, that's okay. I've noticed in my own life,
*  if I don't learn a lesson, I got to get that same lesson again. You know what I mean?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah. I've had this conversation with someone about the idea that you will live
*  your life over and over and over again until you get it right. And that you'll be reborn,
*  you'll have the exact same existence, and you'll do it over again. And this is a concept that some
*  people believe in. Now, I said, how do you feel about that? And they're like, that's terrifying.
*  And I'm like, why is it terrifying when living is not?
*  Right. It's the same thing.
*  Pete Slauson It's the same thing. Like, right? Like, if I had to live this life over and over
*  and over again, look, I'm having a great time. I have a lot of great friends. I have a fantastic
*  family. I have a wonderful thing that I do for a living. I'm very, very, very blessed. I'm very
*  fortunate. If I had to do this forever, why the fuck would I complain about that when I'm not
*  complaining about it now?
*  Pete Slauson Maybe his life's not as good as yours.
*  But am I scared of the eternity of this existence when I'm not scared of the temporary nature of it?
*  That doesn't make any sense. Like, why would I be scared of something that's ultimately very
*  pleasurable? Like, I enjoy life. I enjoy my children and my wife. I enjoy my friends. I enjoy
*  my occupation. I enjoy reading. I enjoy watching documentaries. I enjoy encountering new things.
*  I enjoy these things. Why would I be upset if this went on forever? Why would I be upset if
*  I'm going to be reborn again and then I'm going to be confronted with the exact same problems that
*  maybe I fucked up when I was 10 and 20 and 30 and 40, but this time I'll have a better insight.
*  I'll have a subtly better perception of what is the correct thing to do, what's the best thing
*  to do for everybody, what's the moral, the ethical thing to do, you know? And I don't know why that's
*  terrifying to people, but it is. It's terrifying, the idea of doing it over and over and over again.
*  Ilio Gracie believed that. Ilio Gracie believed that you must do the exact right thing at all
*  moments in your life or you're going to live your life over and over and over again until you get
*  it right. I don't know what-
*  Those Gracies were connected with India somehow, right?
*  Well, they were connected with everything, man. It's one of the most spectacular families.
*  It's an incredible family.
*  It's ever walked the face of the earth. I mean, you want to talk about a contribution,
*  like the contribution that the Gracies have made to martial arts, including our instructor,
*  John Jacques Machado, who is a cousin of the Gracies. They're all trained together. They're
*  all together. That family, Ilio Carlos- Unbelievable.
*  Yeah, I mean, Carlson, all those people, they created this most spectacular martial art out of
*  the origins of Japanese Jiu-Jitsu and Judo and then introduced it to the whole world and literally
*  changed hundreds of millions of people's perceptions about fighting out of this small family in Brazil.
*  It's unbelievable.
*  It's amazing.
*  And they're all champions.
*  Their whole family is filled with champions. And look, that's what made our friend Eddie.
*  When Eddie tapped out Hoyler Gracie, and Hoyler was the most-
*  Disruption to the family.
*  Dude.
*  Tradition.
*  And I was there. I flew with him.
*  Oh, you went there?
*  To Brazil. Yeah, we flew together.
*  With, who else was there? The blonde-
*  Jamie.
*  Jamie.
*  Jamie, yeah. Jamie Walsh. I don't know, I haven't lost touch with him. He owned a moving company.
*  He had a fight organization for a while called Pangea. He was putting on MMA fights.
*  Yeah, Jamie was my trainer for a long time.
*  Oh, really? He was good.
*  Yeah, he was a really good trainer.
*  He was good. Fighter.
*  Yeah.
*  I remember, I didn't know you went. I know he went.
*  Yeah, we all flew together. 2003. Flew down to Brazil and Eddie caught Hoyler in a triangle,
*  and I'll never forget it. I was watching it happen. I mean, I was right there. I was on the side of the map.
*  Let's get that up on the screen.
*  I was watching it happen. I watched the triangle get locked up, and I'm like, oh my God, he's got him.
*  Oh my God. I was thinking, Hoyler, probably is going to get out of this, right? He's Hoyler Gracie.
*  But I'm like, that doesn't look like he's getting out of that. That was so locked in.
*  And Eddie had that masterful guard, still does, but he always had this incredible guard.
*  And it was so sneaky.
*  And it was unique.
*  Yes.
*  And if you're not used to somebody's game-
*  Yeah.
*  I don't think it says anything bad about Hoyler.
*  Oh, no.
*  But it does say that Eddie is genius. He's creative. Like, his music was-
*  And he tapped another world champion right before he tapped Hoyler. He tapped Gustavo Dantes
*  right before he tapped Hoyler. I was there for that, too. And I was like, holy shit.
*  And Eddie was a brown belt at the time, which is really crazy. But then when he locked up that triangle,
*  I mean, I'll get emotional if I think about it. I mean, I was there on the side of the mat watching,
*  and I was like, I can't believe-
*  There it is.
*  There it is. So he tries what he does. He threatened on one side and then cinches up the triangle.
*  You know what? Tell me what the crowd was going like.
*  He used to do total silence. Let me tell you what happened. What they had done
*  before this had happened. See, and then he starts pulling the head. And once he pulls the head,
*  this is right where Hoyler was fucked. He's tapping. He's tapping. He had to tap. He was
*  going to sleep. And he pointed to Jamie, who was right there in his corner. And then-
*  The whole crowd must have been like, what the hell just happened here? Who is this?
*  And then he walked off and he made it look like it was no big deal because he had to fight Leo
*  Viera right after that. He had fucked up his rib somewhere in this scramble, too. And when he fought
*  Leo Viera, he was really messed up. But-
*  When you guys came back that day, it was unbelievable.
*  Pandemonium. It was pandemonium. It's hard for people outside of the Jiu-Jitsu world
*  to understand the magnitude of that accomplishment. But for me, you know, Eddie's my best friend. So
*  flying with him to Brazil was like-
*  It's epic.
*  It was just this ultimate support thing. It was like, we're going to do this. I'm going to help
*  him. He's going to do this. But when he did it, dude, they shut off all the matches while it was
*  happening. They killed all the matches outside of this main match and they put it on television
*  because Hoyler was the multiple time world champion. He was the most accomplished
*  He was the most accomplished no-gi grappler, right?
*  Yes. Well, even gi. I mean, Hoyler in competition had accomplished more. He had competed more than
*  any of the other graces in straight Jiu-Jitsu. He had competed in MMA a little bit, but Hoyce
*  obviously accomplished the most in Jiu-Jitsu in MMA. Hoyce was the innovator. He was the first guy.
*  UFC 1, UFC 2. I mean, those are the most important moments in martial arts, Hoyce's accomplishments.
*  In my opinion, he's like, that's the most significant impact. But Hoyler in terms of
*  Jiu-Jitsu and just Jiu-Jitsu competitions, he had accomplished more than anyone. He was a multiple
*  time world champion. And when he was competing, everybody watched. Everybody knew Hoyler was the
*  fucking man, right? And so when Eddie tapped Hoyler, it was silent. I mean, silent. We're in
*  Sao Paulo, Brazil. I mean, and we're sitting there and Eddie is walking around like this and
*  Jamie is just going, holy shit. And I'm going, holy shit. We were just like, what just happened?
*  And we walked off. And there's a video of us like going through the back hallway of the arena. We're
*  going, what just happened? How the fuck did that just happen? It was crazy. It's crazy.
*  People stunned. No one could believe it. No one could believe it.
*  Yeah. But I think he gave hope. Even people like myself, like, oh, I get it. You can just figure
*  stuff out. And there's hope for me. It's not like, I think that's a great thing about martial arts.
*  We're always looking for who's God. And back then I remember, Vietre Belfort. No one could be
*  Vietre Belfort. Everyone takes turns and then he gets beat. And it almost breaks your hope in God.
*  We're looking for that superhero. But I think the beautiful underlying story is like, you can do
*  that. You can work your way up this ladder and figure out some unique stuff.
*  Yeah. And with Eddie, he was like, he wasn't even a black belt yet. That was the most crazy thing.
*  Like he was- And he just got that brown belt.
*  Yeah. Well, he had at least a year or so, I believe.
*  I believe he was a black belt or a brown belt for at least a year or so.
*  Cause 2003 when I met him, he was a purple belt. And I met him in 99, 98.
*  That's when I met him in 99. I used to train with Hanate.
*  Yeah. Look at how he's squeezing the head there. That's us.
*  That's incredible.
*  Frame it.
*  We just couldn't believe it.
*  Frame that photo.
*  He was just crying. He couldn't believe it.
*  It's crazy. It's crazy.
*  I wish I went.
*  Dude, it's crazy to just watch now. And they interviewed him after he did it.
*  It was crazy, man. It's hard to even watch.
*  It wasn't just that he won. He tapped him out off his back. I mean, he used the ultimate expression
*  of Jiu-Jitsu, which is, you know, in a vulnerable position. The man's on top of you and you still tap him.
*  It was amazing.
*  And as sort of loud as a big person as Eddie is, he's actually, and if you know him, which you do,
*  he's a big guy, but he's a big guy. And he's a big guy.
*  He's a big guy.
*  He's a big guy.
*  As a big person as Eddie is, he's actually, and if you know him, which you do, he's got no ego about him.
*  There's no, I never feel like.
*  He's always making fun of himself.
*  Yeah, he's super, if you don't know him, he seems like, who's this big mouth, boisterous.
*  He's super humble. He's super, he gives all the credit to the Gracies.
*  He loves the Gracies.
*  Yeah.
*  He loves John Jock.
*  Yeah. That was a, you know, there's moments in your life where you just realize like, wow,
*  things are possible.
*  That was a possible moment.
*  Things are possible.
*  The weird things can happen.
*  I was talking to a friend of mine about imposter syndrome.
*  That.
*  Imposter syndrome?
*  Yeah. You know that feeling, the expression?
*  No, it's, you get it when like, when people think that you're really good at something
*  and you don't have a lot of self-worth or you, you, you have this perception of yourself that
*  you're not worthy.
*  Right.
*  You know, like maybe as an artist, that's, that's a big one that you have it as an artist.
*  Like I had it forever as a comedian and I probably still have it a little bit, but less so than
*  I used to because I'm just more accomplished and more understanding of what it is and the
*  more engrossed in the process.
*  And I, I, I know what it is now more than I did before.
*  Okay.
*  And you, like when I meet famous people, if they know who I am, I'd be like, oh my God,
*  I gotta get out of here. This fucking person knows who I am.
*  I'm tricking them. It's a trick.
*  They don't know.
*  And they're like, Hey man, I love your stuff. I'm like, no, you don't. You think you do.
*  You don't trust me. Let me get away from you.
*  Right.
*  It's like this imposter thing. And then sometimes things, enough things happen where you go,
*  you know what? I think I might be legit. I think I might be legit. Like this is so crazy.
*  Like I thought I was an imposter forever, but I think I'm, I'm going to relax and just
*  concentrate on the work and not worry about whether or not I'm an imposter anymore.
*  And just concentrate on the work.
*  That ego is always there.
*  Yeah. It's always there, man. But the ego, it's interesting.
*  Imposter syndrome is often more prevalent in people who are legitimately talented.
*  And for some strange reason, because when you're legitimately talented,
*  one of the ways you become legitimately talented is to be ruthlessly self-critical
*  because that's, that's how you get really good at something.
*  And in ruthless self-critical, like I remember
*  Cat Williams was talking about himself once and Cat Williams, who's a crazy person,
*  but a brilliant comedian. And he said something that I have always thought. And he's like,
*  I'm not a fan of me. And he goes, it goes like, I don't, you know, I don't particularly like me.
*  You know, it's like, that is why he's great because that makes you work so hard.
*  Like the worst thing a comedian can be in the beginning is sure of themselves and then
*  incompetent at the same time. It's horrible. It's horrible because you're not good, but you
*  think you're amazing. And then you understand, you don't know why the world doesn't think you're
*  amazing because you think you're great because you're delusional. You have this sort of
*  artificial image of the world that you've put up and in the world, you are the center.
*  You are the center and you want everything to evolve around you. And the worst thing in terms
*  of for comedy, you, people have to enjoy what you're doing. They have to enjoy and not, not
*  everyone's gonna, you're always going to have some people that don't enjoy no matter what, but
*  you're trying to make it an enjoyable experience for the people watching it. Now, if you are
*  delusional and clueless and if you, you don't understand how people see you,
*  you have a distorted perception of reality, distorted perception of your own, your own,
*  your own presence. It fucks up the vibe for the audience. It fucks up. They, they, they recognize
*  it too quickly because comedy in a weird way is a spiritual pursuit for the person who's making it
*  because you're putting together thoughts and ideas and you're trying to get it into these people's
*  minds in a way that elicits a response that makes them feel good. And the only way that you could
*  really do it is you have to hit those notes. You have to reach that, that resonance. You have to
*  find that frequency, whatever it is that works on them. And you can't be thinking about yourself
*  too much and you can't be pleased with yourself, can't be happy with yourself. You always have to
*  be analyzing. You are, you are the sculptor. You have to be critical. You always have to.
*  And so in doing that, it's really easy to develop imposter syndrome because even when you think
*  doing well, you know, like fucking I've had like, I don't know, nine or 10 comedy specials. It
*  doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how many people like them. They suck. I got to keep going. You
*  got to keep working at it. Like a sick type of perfectionism. Yeah. So when someone would,
*  I don't remember how we even got onto this, but that imposter syndrome exists because your,
*  your ego won't like your mind understands that your ego will fuck this up. If you,
*  if you let your ego say, Oh, I'm the fucking man, you're going to ruin this whole thing.
*  Like you have to, you have to be aware of what this is. Like this, this,
*  this ride requires you to stay within a certain frequency. You have to stay inside that frequency.
*  As soon as you start going, yeah, everything's fucking awesome. It all goes away. All that goes
*  away. You have to stay inside that frequency. And that frequency is not a frequency where you're
*  very pleased with yourself. I think you've gone full circle back to the Bhagavad Gita.
*  Yeah. Cause the Bhagavad Gita is the warriors have to fight the war. You think it's, you think the
*  Bhagavad Gita is going to be like, here's Krishna telling Arjuna not to fight. Arjuna doesn't want
*  to fight. He's got his guru on the other side. He's got his family on the other side. What's
*  Krishna going to say about this? And Krishna's saying, you got to actually fight. You're born
*  to fight. You just have to get out of your ego with this and you have to do it as just a service.
*  And I think when I apply that type of teaching to my life, like sometimes I'm not a great singer.
*  I'm not a great, you know, Indian classical music, but I like to do it and I'm enthusiastic to it.
*  And to me, it's not about me. It's about like sort of like an offering. It was like one of the
*  first teachings I got in the ashram was, when you're on stage, don't do it to make sure you're
*  doing it to serve God and not be God. That statement changed my entire life. And I was like,
*  oh shit, everything I do is to be God. It didn't just change the way I sang. It changed the way I
*  parent. It changed the way I react to friends, to fans, to my parents. It was powerful.
*  I have to sometimes, you know, I like to publicly sing in this. Have you ever heard Kirtan?
*  Pete Slauson No.
*  Jared Slauson It's so interesting.
*  Pete Slauson What is it?
*  Jared Slauson It's chanting, call and response chanting,
*  of chanting mantras. And you use like this pump piano and Indian drums. I'll play some for you
*  later. But it's great. And it's popular in America. It's been sort of a little bit Americanized,
*  but it's good. And it's great. And so, what we do on Pilgrimages, I have my assistant,
*  an incredible drummer, he's from India. And then I play the harmonium, which is a pump piano.
*  And we just sing publicly, call and response. And all the Indian people in India will come around
*  and they'll sing with us. And it's like, it's overwhelming. So, there's one particular temple
*  I go to in one particular holy place where singers come from around the world. It's like basically,
*  you know, Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin. It's like the best Kirtan singers from around the world come
*  and they sing. And I remember one time, I came with a bunch of students of mine,
*  and they called me up to sing. And in my brain, I was like, you guys are like the real deal. I
*  don't want to sing. And they're like, no, no, no, you sing. And I was like, no, seriously,
*  I don't want to sing. Please, you sing. And like thousands of pilgrims come in at the time.
*  And somehow, I felt like I have to do this. I have to sing, because that's what they're ordering me
*  to do. I have to do it in a loving way. I have to do it in a way to make everybody excited,
*  but I can't do it with any ego whatsoever. And it becomes like this incredible tightrope walking.
*  Can I do my best with that? Can you get on stage? And it's not about me as the great comedian,
*  you know? Can I do that sort of as an offering where I feel like people are going to walk away
*  with something and they're going to be changed a little. They're going to be lifted a little.
*  They're going to go home a little bit more connected. It's going to help me and it's going
*  to help them. And can I do it? We have this thing where we say we deflect our praise.
*  People say, hey, great, you're a great yoga teacher. This is how I train my students.
*  You're a great yoga, that was a great thing you did. Our quick answer is by the mercy of my
*  teachers. Like we don't want to hold on to praise because praise exacerbates the ego.
*  Yeah.
*  And so we immediately want to say, and it's not even like we're being falsely humble.
*  We actually are made up of the teachers in my life. All the people that have loved me,
*  cared for me. People are like screwed with me, but they also taught me a lesson.
*  So the yogi's conception is everybody is creating what I am and therefore I don't own any of this.
*  You want to praise me? I'm going to give the praise back to my teacher. Now the teacher's mood is
*  by the mercy of my teacher. I look back at my life and I've realized I'm just like a ball of energy
*  and generally the energy goes to like feed my ego. How can it feed my ego? How can I use that to
*  manipulate girls, to people like me? How can I use everything I've got gifted for my own self
*  aggrandizement? And so when you get these teachers in your life, spiritual teachers who sort of like
*  give you a loving slap or a loving hey, and they turn you on in some way, they take what you already
*  have and they redirect that north instead of south. Everything I was doing was just
*  snowballing devastation. And now you don't give up those qualities that you have, but you use them
*  in a way that brings people up instead of brings them down. That's what we were saying about movies
*  too, or any entertainment or sounds in our mind. That state of mind that you're trying to achieve
*  when you get on stage where you're trying to sing with no ego, that's exactly the frequency that you
*  have to hit when you're doing comedy. You do your best, but you don't do your best so that people
*  love you. You do your best because that's what you're trying to do. That's your craft. This is
*  your thing, your thing that you do, your expression, your art form. You have to manage it.
*  And the way to manage it correctly is you can't go out there with ego. You'll turn people off. They
*  won't feel it. There's moments where you can use that, especially with comedy, where you turn-
*  But it's not ego. It's like-
*  But even if you're doing it though, in comedy, you're doing it for the effect of making people
*  laugh. You're not doing it for the effect of pumping yourself up. And you have to be very
*  careful about that. And if they know that that's what you're doing, they will accept it.
*  That's the art of it.
*  Yes, that's the art of it. It's a dance. There's a strange sort of dance that goes on.
*  I would notice this is humiliating to mention, but I will. If I wasn't doing it in a mood of
*  service as an offering, if I got off stage and that wasn't my motivation, I'd be depressed.
*  Because, and maybe you can relate to this, on stage, I'm the center. I'm the coolest. I'm it.
*  They're singing song lyrics I wrote on my bed. And now they're all singing them. And I'm in
*  another country. Now I'm off stage and I'm a nobody. So if you're not medicating with any
*  type of drug or sex, then all you're left with is a bunch of emotions.
*  Interesting.
*  And I think this is why people who are entertainers can move towards addiction or ways to mask that
*  loneliness that comes with being the center, where the whole world is trying to convince you of the
*  Maya. You've heard that word, Maya. The illusion of life is that you are the center. By the way,
*  Joe, there's an interesting thing I want to mention to you too, because you brought up this point
*  where like, I like living my life. I live a great life. Why wouldn't you want to do that again?
*  And I don't know, and I didn't sort of challenge it a little because you were saying in retrospect
*  back to Helio, Helio said, why would you want to do that? Because the whole Buddhist and Hindu thing
*  is that I don't want to take birth again. And since we were talking about these higher planets
*  and higher beings, they say that planet like earth, and they say there's other ones like this
*  as well. There is some pleasure and some pain. There's people who live in a penthouse,
*  and there's people who are sleeping on the streets. Or you can be on the 100th, whatever floor it was
*  with the World Trade Center and be a CEO, and then a plane can be wrapped, you know, two floors
*  underneath you. You can go from pleasure and pain, the most excruciating plane, and the most
*  incredible highest of pleasure in a moment. So in this sort, I mean, we've got places that are like
*  places in the world, they're like the rape capital of the world. And then you've got places that are
*  sort of like, you know, go to Switzerland or Norway where the currency is strong and the people are
*  beautiful and everything you see is like, it's from like a postcard. So we have like great
*  amounts of pain and great amounts of pleasure on this planet. In such a condition, you could start
*  to question like, why am I here? What is life about? It gives you a window to even ask those
*  questions. Now, if there's just so much pleasure in your life, they say that higher beings
*  don't have the impetus to evolve because there's so much pleasure.
*  Higher beings.
*  Higher beings. So according to the Vedas, there's higher planets.
*  Like Ganesh.
*  Yeah, there's higher planets.
*  Okay.
*  Now, I don't want to say Ganesh, but there's a higher planets with higher beings who just
*  living a high life. And therefore, the impetus to get out of samsara, you know, this word,
*  repeated birth and death, there's no impetus to get out. Sometimes people are suffering so much,
*  there's no impetus to even see a spiritual light. People are suffering tremendously,
*  maybe go to prison or they get caught up in more degrading activity. Sometimes people have so much.
*  So I'm like saying, in your life, you have so much good karma, so to speak. But because you're still
*  embodied, there'll always be sort of like a pinprick because that's part of having a body.
*  Right. But my point was this journey is enjoyable.
*  And that I'm...
*  For you, you got good karma.
*  Is that all it is? Because I've had bad moments. I mean, is it all just...
*  I mean, if you look at yourself like an autobiography, it is choices.
*  Is it...
*  Karma is like...
*  Is it the direction that you choose to push forward and the understanding of the push and pull,
*  the understanding of the discipline and the work and then the kindness and the generosity,
*  and that all these things are connected together, and then also the expression,
*  the ability to express yourself through podcasts or through stand-up comedy,
*  that all these things are enjoyable and that there's a pursuit in that and that
*  the real benefit of it is that other people get entertainment out of it and that...
*  No, your choice is perpetuated, obviously. But there's other people who've done
*  podcasts, who've done comedy, and they're just not successful at it.
*  Yeah, but it's a puzzle though. It's like saying other people sing songs,
*  but people don't play them back.
*  Yeah, there are bands before Green Day, like the Buzzcocks from the 70s,
*  who, in my opinion, were better than Green Day, but they just weren't at the right time historically.
*  Sure. They didn't have the right publicists.
*  There's always going to be that, but my point is you don't have to be famous to be happy.
*  It's just... Life is interesting. Life is enjoyable. Sometimes it's hard and sometimes
*  it's painful. Sometimes it's emotionally devastating, for sure. But the idea,
*  if you are alive and enjoying life, the idea of doing it forever is terrifying to people.
*  That was what my point was. Why is it terrifying? If it's not terrifying to do it now,
*  why is the eternal existence so disturbing to people?
*  Right. Unless they have had a traumatic life.
*  Yeah.
*  Which a lot of people have.
*  Yes, a lot of people have.
*  A lot of people have.
*  Yes, a lot of people have.
*  I don't think my life was so traumatic. I think I got some life lessons.
*  Let's leave them out of that equation and let's just talk about people who have not had a traumatic
*  life, who have a... Look, if you're in America and you're not sick and you have friends, you're
*  doing infinitely better than most people on planet.
*  Sure.
*  We're really fortunate in terms of the environments that we exist in. If you're not being abused and
*  you have a job and you have hobbies and things to do, goddamn are you lucky. You could be born in
*  Afghanistan. You could be living in the Congo, suffering from a host of different pathogens
*  and bacteria and viruses.
*  But your thing is according to that person, was it Helio who made up that idea?
*  Yes. I don't think he made it up. I think Helio obviously was a great warrior as well as a great
*  jujitsu teacher, but he had this philosophy on existence and that you had to live your life and
*  do the right things always. And if you didn't, you would come back again and do it all over again.
*  Well, the Vedic system is similar, but it's not the exact... You don't get born as Joe
*  Rogan again, living a parallel life and like, oh, I didn't take out the garbage that day. I
*  should have taken out the garbage. It'd more be like, according to your desires and your activities
*  and your thoughts and the people you associate with, you moved up psychically. You got a little
*  more degraded, either upgrade or degrade basically. It was similar.
*  Do you think of yourself like that? Do you think... Like when you think of yourself and
*  you're fortunate in the interesting life you've carved out, do you feel like your past life has
*  had some sort of an impact on who you are right now?
*  For sure.
*  For sure, huh?
*  For sure.
*  Really? Why are you so sure?
*  Well, it's just sort of like my worldview is that there's not a randomness that everything is
*  building upon something. And the same way I'm building upon tomorrow today.
*  So you feel like...
*  And I'm building on next week, by how I act this week, and it could take it bigger and bigger and
*  bigger. So in that sense, it makes sense, but there's a little bit more of a leap of faith,
*  and I'm building up to a climax where I'll take another body, or I'm coming from a place where
*  I have some talents. We call them your God-given gifts, or my daughter is a gifted artist. But the
*  idea is that it's been a practice that we've been practicing and bringing with us for lifetimes,
*  and both good and bad.
*  And this is a belief system that you just sort of adopt because there's not really any evidence.
*  It's not that I've adopted. That's how the yogis view karma.
*  Right. I understand, but you taking this in yourself as well.
*  I take it myself because I see it in this lifetime. Now, like I said, that I don't...
*  There's blind faith, and then there's reasonable faith. So my reasonable faith lies in this
*  lifetime. I've witnessed my body change. I've witnessed my mind change, my intelligence change.
*  I've witnessed myself cultivate desires that heal me, make me stronger, make me lighter,
*  make me more connected. I've witnessed myself choose bad choices, things that are addictive,
*  things that are defiling my consciousness or my body or my health. So in this lifetime, I know
*  I can steer my karma. And at the same time, there's certain things that are out of my hands.
*  Like you and me are on a flight to San Diego, and the plane's going to San Diego. What we do
*  on that plane, the plane journey is our karma. What we do on that plane, that's our free will.
*  So that's the difference between free will and destiny. There is a difference of the two.
*  Just because there is karma doesn't mean you're bound to it. You can move it. But the yoga system
*  is to bring us to this... I'm trying to keep it simple. To this, it's called satva, or it's a
*  state of self-control, of peace, of balance. So all the things of the whole culture is based to
*  keep the mind peaceful. And when the mind is peaceful, I act less on impetus and more from
*  a higher chakras or higher thoughts or higher intelligence. For example, if I slap a panther,
*  panthers gonna bite me. Why? Because panthers bite when you slap them. If I slap Joe,
*  you could act from a different place. Hey man, what's up? Or you could be like immediately.
*  And sometimes I feel that also. I feel like I'm acting from a lower place. I'm angry. I'm gonna
*  kick that... And sometimes I feel like... I mean, do this with parenting. Sometimes I get angry at
*  my child. I say, don't you understand? He's just trying to talk to you. He's just trying to share
*  how he experiences it. I have to pull myself back and let go of any way I was parented and try to
*  like act from a higher place. So there's always... They say in the human species,
*  there's always this chance to either upgrade your activities or degrade your activities.
*  And they snowball off of each other. Like every good choice helps you make a better choice.
*  We said that with diet, with exercise. How do we get talking about that, Joe?
*  We were talking about karma.
*  Is this just massive detours that we're taking?
*  No, no, no. We're getting into places. We were talking about your belief
*  that your karma is connected to what you've done in the past life.
*  Sure. So that's a bigger leap of faith. And you say, I see it in this life.
*  And you see it in other people as well. So when you see people, you look at their life and you
*  think this person, where they are right now, is directly connected to what they've done in
*  the past life. Yeah.
*  It's an interesting philosophy. It's an interesting perspective.
*  It's an interesting lens. And it's nice about it, even in Western psychiatry,
*  if I go and complain about my husband or my wife, a good psychiatrist will go, well,
*  what's your responsibility in this? Is it all your wife or is it you?
*  They take you back. And when you really study this Vedic thought,
*  you realize that there is no more blaming anybody. I've just got what I've got for whatever reason.
*  Now what am I going to do with that? What am I going to do today? It's also, what am I going
*  to do tomorrow? The why me shit never happens because I've got what I got. I probably did
*  something. And people don't like to hear that, but we don't know our backstory. And
*  to be truthful, I have a blind side, a blind spot when it comes to anything atrocious I've done in
*  this life. I forget all the times I've hurt people, broke people's hearts, was rude or cruel or
*  thoughtless. So I got to get some karma too. In this life, what to speak of a previous life,
*  where I'm oblivious to. Right.
*  And if I just want to blame the circumstance,
*  here's your option. You can either be free from that, be acceptance and accept that there's
*  benevolent forces that are trying to teach us lessons to get out of the birth and death,
*  or you can just be bitter at the world. Why me? Unfair.
*  Pete So, this idea of benevolent forces that are trying to teach us, do you feel that
*  this spiritual quest is almost like a divine puzzle that human beings are proposed? And that
*  you are given this infinite series of options and in choosing the right way of thinking and behaving,
*  you can carve out the righteous path as best you can. You will make mistakes, but that there's
*  a spiritual undertaking that is a part of operating this puzzle correctly. And that this is what all
*  these teachings are about. And it's trying to, we're all trying to relay what we've learned and
*  what we've experienced personally, and we're trying to relay it to other people so that they
*  can relate, and so that they can also make choices that will allow them to more refine their approach
*  to life to achieve better spiritual balance. Jared Yeah! Well said. There's, you know,
*  the yogis call them yamas and niyamas. Sort of like –
*  Pete Say it again?
*  Jared Yamas and niyamas.
*  Pete Yamas? Yamas and iyamas?
*  Jared Yeah, it's like yamas and niyamas. Things you do and things you don't do.
*  Pete Okay.
*  Jared And it's the equivalent of like, sort of guardrails on the road. Right? You drive a little
*  bit off too far, you scratch your car because of the guardrail. But if it wasn't there, it'd be
*  complete tragedy. So, there's sort of like things that we pull in with our sexuality, with our
*  thoughts, with our words. It's how to use the vehicle in this lifetime. So, the vehicle being
*  the body. What we do, what we don't do. What we don't, what we do, you know, what to eat,
*  what to think, what to speak, how to speak, how to relate to people, how to relate to juniors,
*  how to relate to seniors. So, the whole Vedic culture is carved out like this.
*  That in itself is not spiritual. It just assists you in driving a car. I still got to go north.
*  And so, once I can take care of how to like, take care of this machine and keep it on the road,
*  then I reach out for connection.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Jared And that's the spiritual. So, there's dharma. But then there's dharma that's supposed
*  to get us connected. That's what genuine yoga –
*  Pete What is the effect of dharma? What is that, the definition rather of dharma again?
*  Jared Dharma means sort of like a right living. It's not – some people confuse it with, well,
*  doing what you're born to do. Because I don't think it's just doing what you're good at.
*  Because you could be good at leadership and be a dictator. And you're a great leader. Everyone's
*  going to do what you do, but –
*  Pete Hitler was a great leader.
*  Jared Great leader. Great leader is probably in his chart. But then you also have great leaders,
*  like a Christ. He was like a great leader also. So, it's not just leadership. It's leading
*  person towards connection so that your activity has a benevolent effect on everyone it touches.
*  That's dharma. That's dharma in its true sense. And that's the dharma of your body. Like,
*  your dharma is you entertain. You could say a warrior. You could also say you have also dharma
*  as a father. So, that's – these are all type of like – you're carved out for that, you know?
*  If you weren't doing that, you'd always feel like a little lack in your life. But then there's
*  like a nitya dharma or what you – and the nitya dharma is actually the dharma of the soul.
*  And that's why in the Vedic system, it's not like you're trying to convert somebody to be
*  of your religion. It's not like a home run to say, okay, I got a Christian to become a Hindu.
*  That's not what it is. The idea is that everybody is a spirit soul. You can change.
*  It's not about joining the same church or the same ashram. It's like a soul is a soul. It's
*  truth. Truth is truth. There's no – no one's got a monopoly on truth. There's no such thing as –
*  it's like math. It's not Jewish math or Hindu math or Christian. It's like math is math.
*  So, we want to apply truth to the life, to the vehicle. And that's going to give direction to
*  the vehicle. That's going to be the food for the soul. And that's what the genuine meaning of yoga,
*  people say it's a balance the mind. It's not a balance. It's to connect the atma or the soul
*  with divinity, with Bhagavan. That's the real yoga. And that's when – yoga means to come together,
*  but in the original text and the original ancient teachings of Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita,
*  it's all about is here I am lost in the crazy plan. I'm driving my car everywhere.
*  How to keep it on the road and where do I go? And that's the classical concept of what yoga is.
*  – How do we keep it on the road and where do I go? I like that way of looking at it.
*  – I mean, we go off the road.
*  – Yeah. And we need these discussions.
*  – We've been off the road.
*  – We need these discussions. People need these discussions. We need – I mean, I need them right
*  now having it with you. I appreciate it. But we need to hear other people having these discussions.
*  We need to have them personally ourselves. This is –
*  – I do it every morning on my podcast, 5 a.m.
*  – You do your podcast every day?
*  – Every day for an hour. And it's sort of like a check-in.
*  – It's on iTunes and all that jazz?
*  – It's on iTunes.
*  – It's called the wisdom of the sages.
*  And me and I co-host with another friend who was a monk for a long time with me. And we were both
*  teenagers from the Lower East Side. And so we do it together and we have –
*  – Is he in Upstate as well?
*  – He's in New York City, Manhattan.
*  – Okay. So you do it remotely?
*  – We do it on Zoom.
*  – Okay.
*  – But through – it goes to Lipson with all the podcasts.
*  – Yeah. I've done it at Zoom. I did a Jordan Peterson podcast through Zoom once.
*  – I saw that.
*  – Yeah.
*  – Great.
*  – It works. You can do it. It's weird, though.
*  – But we have like 90 people join us live.
*  And so everyone knows each other and then it's also done public. So it's fun.
*  – I enjoy it. There's something about doing podcasts that you are working out ideas. It's made
*  me infinitely more aware of my thoughts. Infinitely better at communicating.
*  – Speaking and writing, too. Since I'm writing two books right now and they're both helping me.
*  Like, yeah, I always thought that. But now this is a better way to say it.
*  I'm sure you do that when you write material.
*  – Yes, for sure. But my friend Eddie Wong, he had a really interesting take on that. He's like,
*  that's what I do first thing in the morning. He goes, I write. And he goes, and I write every day.
*  In writing every day, it helps me really understand how I think about things. Because I'm really,
*  really contemplating, really concentrating on how do I actually think about these things.
*  What is actually important to me? And that activity of writing for his own education,
*  for his own betterment is very important to him. And it made a big
*  impact on me, him saying it that way. I'm like, oh, okay, that makes sense.
*  – So many people, by the way, Joe, it's so good that you're doing this. So many people I know
*  listen to this show. Like, it's weird. And it's a real wide swath of people.
*  – Yeah. I know, it's weird. It's a strange thing. And this is going to sound crazy,
*  but not any crazier than all the other shit we've said so far. I feel like this show made itself.
*  I feel like I'm the person who's been granted the curator position on this show. I feel like
*  this show, all the challenges that I've had through this show have sort of all the fuck-ups
*  and all the things that I've said that were stupid. Those were almost like were put in front of me
*  to make me understand the consequences of not respecting it, or of not treating it with the
*  proper focus and concentration, and that this thing is almost like it's always been here.
*  And I'm like an archaeologist who's just brushing the dirt away. And I'm the curator. And I have to
*  show up every day and turn the lights on. – Artists always describe themselves, I think it was
*  Michaelangelo. Michaelangelo described it like that. I can say myself as a puny songwriter,
*  I felt like the song was already written. – Yeah.
*  – And the lyrics are already written. – I feel like that with comedy. When I come up with a good
*  bit, like I have this new bit that I've only had for like four or five days now and I've been
*  working on it, I feel like it was a gift. I mean, I know I wrote it. I know I typed it. I know I
*  thought about it. But where? From where? From what? – Yeah, like what is that coming from?
*  – What is creativity? – What is that coming from? What is the –
*  – It's a gift. And that's one of the things about pot and one of the things about
*  booze and all the different ways that I achieve different states of mind. They help me get out
*  of my own way so I could find these things better. That's really what it is. It's not as much of an
*  escape from reality. It's an escape from me. – From your thoughts.
*  – Yes, from me, from my bullshit so that I can find these thoughts better, so that I can go on
*  stage and then my reward is this strange feeling that you get when you know everyone's laughing.
*  This is wild. But the better I get at it, the less I enjoy it in the moment because I'm not
*  thinking, this is great, I'm killing. I am just staying on point.
*  – You ever say something where you're just laughing at your own joke?
*  – Yeah, for sure, because things come up that I don't know that I'm going to say.
*  – They weren't planned.
*  – And then I say it and then I start laughing. But it has to be organic. I'm not going to fake
*  laugh on stage, but I will laugh on stage. My goal is always to just hit that frequency.
*  The goal is to hit that frequency where people are laughing and say it with the right economy
*  of words and the right order and find the best way to get it into people's heads.
*  The crazy thing is the better you get at it, the more effect it has on people,
*  but the less effect it has on me. I'll do an arena and I'll crush and I'll get a standing
*  ovation in front of an arena and I barely feel it. I barely feel it like me, like I just did
*  something. I'm like a passenger on a ride. – Like a passenger has to be a little bit.
*  – Yeah, that's what it feels like. The better I get at it, the more I feel like a passenger.
*  But conversely, if I fuck up, I feel like I fucked up. If I screw something up, if I mess up a bit,
*  if I do something, the pain is on me 100%. So the pleasure kind of dissipates.
*  – Or it's like a more of an internal pleasure. The pleasure is not from what they are giving back.
*  – It's confirmation that I'm doing the right thing. That's what it is. It's like everybody's
*  happy. I'm happy that you're happy. And it's a genuine feeling of appreciation.
*  – It's like that concept of the warrior just doing his duty. I'm just doing it. This is what I do.
*  – Now, the Bhagavad Gita, this is the thing that I wanted to talk to you about.
*  When we're talking about the Vedas and we're talking about all the ancient texts,
*  you think that all that stuff is real. – Could be real.
*  – Could be real. But you're saying it's real. You're like, that shit's all real.
*  – That's my sort of like hashtag, this is all real. It's because when you stumble upon this
*  thing, I was like, man, this is all real. Because being a rational thinker, I'm always holding back
*  some reservation for like, this can't all be real. But things always just show up. I was like,
*  damn, that's so real. Can I tell you this crazy one?
*  – Sure.
*  – I don't want to tell too much about the details because I don't want to keep it private.
*  But we're only doing it to 200 million people.
*  I had a person, an astrologer, at my teacher training. I was training people to be teachers.
*  And one of the ladies was from a very wealthy family. She's older than me.
*  Her kids went to school together. And he did this interesting, this astrologer did this interesting
*  class where he did this class on karma, where he shows how karma is actually scientific and
*  predictable. So everyone would have to give their, like I said earlier, longitude, latitude,
*  date and time of birth. I was born on January 11th, 330 a.m., 1966. And you'd have to give that
*  all in. So he doesn't know anybody. And he's calling, okay, who was born on 1983, February 6th?
*  They called the person forward and they said, and he wouldn't do their whole chart, but he'd show
*  some big hiccup in their chart. And he'd say, it seems like in October you experience great loss.
*  And the person would be like, oh my God, my father died in October. And every person he was calling
*  up, he would just read the hiccup. So one particular lady, she said that was so good, can you do my
*  entire chart? So he had it done. Now this lady, I knew her, she grew up with somebody world famous.
*  I won't mention who it is, but it's something, a household name. And they were best friends.
*  And she grew up in a very wealthy family. But as she got older, she just became, she became a
*  simple artist. But that famous person was always in her life. And then that person died a tragic
*  death. And so she never had much after that financially. So a particular magazine, like a
*  gossip tabloid, found out that she was friends with this person. And on the anniversary of this
*  person, famous person's death, they were going to put out a special issue. And they found that she
*  had all these intimate photos of this person. So they offered her a massive amount of money for
*  these photos. So I'm standing, I know the story, and I'm standing there with the astrologer,
*  and the astrologer is saying, okay, it seems like in July, you're going to have more money
*  than you've ever had in your life. And she was just like, she looks at me, and we look at each
*  other like, oh my God. And she told them the whole story. She said, yeah, and in July,
*  they're cutting me the check. In July, how did you know that? And the astrologer very humbly just
*  goes, it's been known since your birth. Pete Harsch So, this is like the ultimate version
*  of determinism, right? Jared Harsch Yes and no. It's like, use that analogy.
*  Pete Harsch It's more cosmic.
*  Jared Harsch Well, use that analogy of the plane. There is a determinism,
*  but there's also individual free will, which can sometimes affect, sometimes you're going to
*  just get what you get, but how I react to what I get, that's going to create a whole new set of
*  karma for me. Right? Pete Harsch Yeah. How you react to what you get is definitely, yeah.
*  Jared Harsch We're all going to get some thing.
*  Pete Harsch Yeah.
*  Jared Harsch And by me associating with people who are connected,
*  by being associating with people who are a little bit more in tune, then when something happens to
*  me, some great life reversal, some incredible loss, some chronic disease, whatever, I might react to
*  it in a different way. And that's going to create a whole new pathway for me.
*  Pete Harsch Yeah. Well, depending upon your actions,
*  you reacted to things differently depending upon your physical state. And that's one of the things
*  that yoga really helps. One of the ways that yoga helps your karma is yoga relaxes you to
*  consequences and to things that happen. Like, I remember I was driving on the highway
*  and there was this kid behind me. He's an illegal alien and he was on his phone and he hit the brakes
*  too late and he slammed into my Porsche. I have a rare Porsche. It's a very nice car and he fucked
*  up my car. And I got out and he didn't have a license. And-
*  Jared Harsch Or insurance.
*  Pete Harsch He had insurance, actually. I didn't think he did, but I took down his information.
*  I took a photo of his insurance card and I told him, I said, you should get out of here, man.
*  You're going to get arrested. You slammed into me. You don't have a license. You're not even
*  supposed to be driving. They're going to take your car. His car was fucked up. My car actually drove.
*  I drove it to the comedy store. But I remember the way I reacted to him because I had done yoga
*  three days in a row. Jared Harsch It was cool and calm.
*  Pete Harsch Yeah. I was happy. I was okay because he slammed into me, man.
*  Jared Harsch Like that fight story I told. I wasn't angry.
*  Pete Harsch Yeah.
*  Jared Harsch It changes how you react. First of all, it changes how you react in the moment
*  when you're doing the asana class. It has a secondary effect like you just said.
*  And the third way it affects you is at the time of death. The idea, I've actually had almost a
*  near-death experience with this too, where you are focused. In the same way you're not angry,
*  you're not freaking out, you become incredibly focused as if I'm about to leave my body.
*  And you can say it, once I was attacked. And I had probably the most spiritual experience in my life.
*  And it was- Pete Harsch How were you attacked?
*  Jared Harsch It's such a story. But it's, I was at a show.
*  I was, we were, the time in my life when I was monks, we were all monks.
*  And we were traveling and we played in sort of a ghetto part of Buffalo at a big show.
*  Materially speaking, it was great. We were big, people loved us, we sold merchandise.
*  Pete Harsch And which band was this?
*  Jared Harsch This was Shelter. It's my next band.
*  Pete Harsch Yes, it is.
*  Jared Harsch And after the show, it was about two in the morning and everybody's getting out of the
*  club. And I'm in the alley getting interviewed for some magazine. And our van is parked, you could
*  drive the car in the van in the club and all the doors and windows are open and our guys were
*  unloading all the gear. Basically, only a few people left in the club breaking down the club.
*  And I was outside getting interviewed. And all of a sudden, this car pulls up with these massive
*  dudes who weren't from the punk scene. They looked like just sort of ghetto dudes. And they were
*  ripped and they were big and they just grabbed one of the younger kids. I mean, our show is,
*  everyone was 17, 19, 20. They grabbed one kid and just beat the living crap out of them.
*  And I was like, ugh. I'm getting interviewed, so it's sort of awkward. And it's happening about
*  50 yards away from me.
*  Pete Harsch Just randomly started beating them up, didn't talk to them first.
*  Jared Sussman Didn't talk to them. Picked them up, threw them down, beat them, and then went to
*  another kid and did that. By the time they got to the third kid, everybody just started running for
*  their life. Here's like a, you know, you don't think of these things in times of great like
*  fear and anxiety. Why don't you do this? Why don't you do that? All I did was I ran back in the club
*  to get my band. I said, you guys, we got to get out of here. There's a bunch of crazy guys outside.
*  And all my roadies, we're all monks, by the way, but all the guys who were my roadies said,
*  we can't go anywhere. Like the equipment's half in the car, the t-shirts aren't loaded.
*  And all of a sudden, the bad guys, their car drives into the club and parks like a T,
*  blocking our van so we couldn't get out of the club any longer.
*  And they get out of the car. And there's not that many people. There's a couple bands and
*  sound men and stuff around the club. And the biggest guy gets out and he grabs a gun.
*  And he just goes in a really serious and unemotional way. I've got a gun
*  and I'm going to kill everyone tonight. And it was one of these like eerie, sort of like eerie organ
*  music you could hear. And I was like, it just felt like, oh, this is the day. You know, the day you
*  always talk about, that death day where you don't expect it and you expect it and then you get the
*  deal, the ace of spades, that's your day now. And I was like, oh, shit. And I was the older,
*  you know, devotee, Krishna devotee, these were your Krishna devotee monks, or bhakti yoga monks.
*  And so all the other guys in the band came up to me, what are we going to do? What are we going to
*  do? Now they weren't right near us at the time. They were literally going around and beating
*  people up. And all the other monks came up to me, you know, Raghu, what are we going to do?
*  And I had already sort of given up on escaping or anything. I just looked, I don't know where I got
*  this from because I'm definitely not an elevated soul. But I said, we're going to die tonight.
*  And so we're going to chant. And I went into the—
*  Pete Slauson Jesus Christ.
*  Jared Slauson I know!
*  Pete Slauson Why wouldn't you just run?
*  You know what? In retrospect, I don't know. But let me circle back with this. I grab the drum out,
*  I play this Indian drum, and we all started chanting these mantras to Nisringadev, who's
*  an avatar of Vishnu. You usually chant for a type of protection, but we all started really focusing
*  and chanting this mantra. It's an unbelievable story, but it's all true. And as they were beating
*  up people, they finally came to us. And all my guys ran for their life. Some guys were on
*  under the van, in the van, above the van. And I'm surrounded by this gang. And the biggest guy just
*  grabs the gun and he goes to me, do you want some? I was like, freaking trick question, what am I
*  supposed to say here? And so I just, you know, by the way, I didn't look like a monk. I had jeans on.
*  It's not like let's beat up monk day. It was just a random act of violence. And so I just put my
*  hands in like a namaste and said, Hare Krishna, I'm a devotee of Lord Krishna, and I have no idea
*  why you are angry. And then for the first time in my life, I felt completely helpless. I was just
*  like repeatedly beaten and just punched. And it's just one of those things. It's not like you can
*  even fight back. You are just getting pounded. But what happened was every time I got punched,
*  I chanted a mantra. So it was sort of like, Vishnu, Narayan, Chaitanya, Krishna, Govinda,
*  Gopal. Every time I chanted to the point where I was like, oh, this is amazing. I'm actually
*  chanting. I was actually stepping outside of myself saying, I'm actually in meditation
*  on sacred names. And then all of a sudden, my head was down and I looked behind me,
*  and there were these three girls coming to protect me and they had baseball bats.
*  And then I realized, no, they're not. They're the girlfriends of these guys. And then I started
*  getting hit by a baseball bat. Unbelievable. Three times in the head, one on the shoulder,
*  and two in the legs. And every time I…
*  Pete Slauson And this is a random thing. There's no reason
*  for them to hit you.
*  Jared Slauson As far as I know, it was random. I didn't know them. They didn't know me. They
*  weren't from that scene. Our show was in a ghetto. You know, there's always a cause of something,
*  but I have no idea what the cause was. And so, every time – but miraculously,
*  and you read these stories in the Mahabhar and the Ramayana, all these epics of India,
*  the great sage leaves his body. He calls Lord Krishna's chariot in front of him. Then he chants
*  these mantras. And I'm thinking, oh my God, I'm chanting these mantras at the time of death.
*  I'm chanting at the time of death. This is the perfection of my life. That was what was going
*  through my head. I kid you not. And I was like outside of my body and I wasn't fearful.
*  And then all of a sudden, to wrap up the story, everything stopped. And I didn't really know what
*  happened, but what was happening was all the guys in the band jumped in our car, our van,
*  and plowed through their car and took off. And I can't remember how, but I ended up in the street,
*  in some ghetto street, carrying this Indian clay drum. I look like – ever see that movie,
*  Carrie? The girl is covered in blood. I was covered in blood from my head all the way down,
*  all over the drum, and I'm walking in the streets trying to flag down a car.
*  The cars would slow down, see me, and then speed away because I looked like a zombie or something.
*  And then I realized, oh man, something – and you're running sort of high on adrenaline.
*  I remember being very lucid and I went over to some light I saw. It looked like a garage where
*  they fixed cars or house buses or something, and it was open. And there was a man in a booth and I
*  said, sir, you have to call the police. Because I thought my friends now were getting beat up.
*  Or killed or whatever. And I said, you have to call the police. My friends are in trouble.
*  And the guy literally looked at me and just said, I'm busy.
*  And I said, listen, you've got to call the police right now.
*  And if you don't mind, I'm just going to hide in this booth because I think these guys might come
*  back and kill me. And so I'm kneeling down in this dirty garage at two in the morning.
*  And the first thing in my mind is no one knows where I am. My mother doesn't know where I am.
*  Friends don't know where I am. My band members don't know where I am. They could be getting killed.
*  And everything was so good today. Like I had a great day. And now it's over like a dream.
*  And I even have these lyrics that were like, this world's like a dream. It's not what it seems.
*  We think it's solid but it fades. I was like, I even – and sort of – my self-talk became a prayer.
*  I started saying, I really wasn't expecting to die tonight. But that's what the dream is.
*  It seems real and now it's over. And I started to think like, oh my god, I was – I was sort of like
*  in a state of like Samadhi when I was getting beat up. I was focused. I was connected. And I was
*  chanting at that time. I said, but now maybe my – if I got – I'm just trying to think my,
*  my, you know, Boy Scout first aid is like, I might have a concussion. My brain's going to swell. I'm
*  going to fall asleep. And then I won't be in meditation. And I started saying, I said, I said,
*  I started praying sincerely. Krishna, I wasn't expecting to die tonight.
*  But you were so kind considering I'm not evolved to enter my lips so I could just chant.
*  So please don't let me die with a concussion. If you want to take me, please take me right now.
*  And with all sincerity, I started chanting these prayers that I had memorized, these very beautiful
*  prayers from an ancient book. But they're prayers – I focused a picture of Krishna in my mind and
*  I started chanting these prayers. And then unfortunately I lived.
*  Unfortunately.
*  Because I was in such a perfect –
*  That's ridiculous.
*  Meaning I was at a – that's how I would want to die.
*  Hmm.
*  So there was no book, there's no teacher, there's no pilgrimage. There was no – that taught me more
*  about my spiritual path than that beat down day. Because I felt like however –
*  You were as close to dying.
*  Because I felt like however –
*  You were as close to dying as you can get.
*  As so close to dying but I felt like –
*  You had accepted it.
*  That – and I had been taken care of. Like in that time of great tragedy,
*  I felt connected more than I've ever been connected. And I wouldn't wish it again.
*  But I'm so happy it happened.
*  We still never got to the Bhagavad Gita.
*  Sorry about that.
*  We turned –
*  A hard –
*  A hard –
*  I want to know why you think that that's real and what you think is going on.
*  In those stories.
*  Well, first you've got the dialogue itself. Which is cool wisdom for all people.
*  Yeah. And some of it is like hyper bizarre. Like what Oppenheimer quoted,
*  the detonation of the atomic bomb.
*  Right.
*  I am become death, destroyer of worlds.
*  Kaloshmi lokshayakrit pravridho.
*  Is that the –
*  Time – that's the Sanskrit.
*  How does he say it?
*  Kaloshmi lokshayakrit pravridho.
*  Is that why –
*  Time I am, the destroyer. Time I am the great destroyer and I've come to destroy all worlds.
*  So that's one –
*  That's the actual translation.
*  That's the actual translation in English.
*  Because his translation, Oppenheimer's, was I am become death.
*  Is that because of an issue with the translation between Hindu and English?
*  It's just different people translated. Slightly different.
*  But it's similar. Meaning in that particular section that you pulled out that was
*  Krishna explaining like God is beautiful, God is charming, God is your best friend,
*  he's also death personified. So he's saying in that particular place I am actually also the
*  destroyer of all the worlds. When we think of – the yogis explain that God is everything.
*  And so Krishna is just sharing his attributes and in that particular chapter, Chapter 11,
*  he's the most, the most intimidating.
*  Where do you think all these stories come from? Where do you – what do you think the origin
*  of the Bhagavad Gita, of the Mahabharata, of all the ancient texts, what do you think the origin was?
*  What was the motivation behind all these stories? What was the motivation behind all these stories?
*  What was the motivation to put this stuff down? What was the original concepts that led them to
*  write this and where did it all come from? There has to be an origin of these, these wisdoms,
*  right? What do you think that is?
*  Yeah. You know, to even answer the question, I have to take myself out of Raghu
*  and just answer like a yoga teacher. Because the answer of what do you think, it's one thing you're
*  sort of trained not to do as far as what is your personal opinion. I can give you my personal
*  opinion but I have to separate it from what the stories themselves say.
*  Okay. Well, give me your personal opinion.
*  My personal opinion is I hear what the stories have to offer, I find some value in the stories
*  and I try to apply wisdom to my life. It helps the direction of my life. It helps me escape
*  potholes.
*  I understand.
*  The stories themselves say these are all real. They're way beyond your perception.
*  They were orally transmitted. At a certain time historically, they understood people are getting
*  dumber. See, we have a tendency to think we're at the pinnacle of evolution, but the Vedic teachings
*  is that as we go on in this age, we get more and more disconnected. There was a time where
*  architecture was more evolved, where the sciences were more evolved.
*  Wait a minute, stop. The sciences were more evolved?
*  The sciences, like for example, the building of these Vimanas, which when we read them now,
*  we just think that's mythological. Even weaponry. Weaponry, they say we're done with sound.
*  There's one book called The Donner Ray.
*  Okay, but do you think this is real?
*  Do I think it's real? I think it could be. I don't think it's definitely, I definitely don't know.
*  So you think at one point in time, human beings had Vimanas and they flew around the sky and then
*  they had weapons that used sound. Could, could, why not?
*  Was no evidence, archaeological evidence that there was a flying craft or that there was ever
*  any technology that allowed people to leave gravity. Yeah, there's sometimes there may not
*  be evidence. Just like there's, let me show you, what was the guy's name Hill? Barney Hill. Barney
*  Hill. What's your evidence? He could just say, well, it's my own experience. I mean, he's just
*  relaying, that's a totally different thing. He's just relaying his personal experience. He could
*  have had some sort of a psychotic break. He could have had, I mean, it could have been mass
*  psychosis with him and his, I mean, with two people. Group psychosis with him and his wife.
*  I can say that there are things that make no sense
*  to me. Yet I sort of tried them anyway. And then after time, they made sense. Like, well, wait a
*  second, that does make sense. Or at different vantage points of my life, it didn't make sense
*  when I was 20, but at 50, that makes a lot of sense. So there are certain things that are
*  huge leaps of faith that I can't say, I definitely know that to be true. Just like
*  chanting on munchers. Made no sense. Made no real sense. But over time I realized actually that
*  helps in this particular way. But she has a state, a state of consciousness. We've known that forever,
*  that achieving, that meditation in general achieves certain states of consciousness.
*  And you can actually with fMRI, you can actually monitor the changes in the way the brain is.
*  See, this is what I like about you. You're one of those guys, you get into these very interesting,
*  like, subtle sciences, and then you find like hard evidence for these things. And just hearing that
*  thing with James Wilk and breaking all these things down. I'm more of a simpler guy. I find
*  people where I trust the way they live, and they've applied stuff and walked the... It's more like I
*  can tell time, but I don't know how to take apart a clock and put it back together.
*  Pete Slauson No, I think exactly the same way. I'm fascinated by watches.
*  Jared Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson But then you see all the gears behind a watch,
*  like a self-winding watch, and you're like, I don't know what the fuck is happening here.
*  I'm sure I can find it out eventually.
*  Jared Slauson I'm like that with a lot of things. And I'm always impressed when you
*  dig into it with people like this. But truthfully, if you want to know the honest truth,
*  I was like, oh man, I hope Joe doesn't dig into it with me because I'm not that kind of hard science
*  guy. There's people... Like even all the stuff I did in yoga...
*  Pete Slauson I'm concerned with you as a human being. That's why I asked you very specifically,
*  what do you think?
*  Jared Slauson Right. Well, I can say like the stuff that you
*  liked about me fighting was endurance, flexibility. I give all the credit to yoga.
*  Pete Slauson You did at the time too.
*  Jared Slauson Pranayam and fasting.
*  Pete Slauson I've told many people that you had crazy cardio.
*  And your cardio was, you never did cardio. You just did breathing exercises.
*  Jared Slauson Never did cardio. Just sat down.
*  Pete Slauson You always had great cardio. You always led
*  like really good endurance.
*  Jared Slauson And my cardio was even better. I remember being
*  at the bomb squad once on day 17 of a 21-day fast.
*  Pete Slauson Wow.
*  Jared Slauson Day 17. And I remember fighting, I can't remember his name,
*  he's like, what? And you know how jujitsu class ends when we're all tanked and we're all like,
*  and I just kept on going and he's like, man, what is up with you? I was like,
*  I don't know, I haven't eaten solid food in 17 days. So, it's not like I'm a genius. It's just that
*  these are sort of like yoga, fasting, deep breathing. I've just been doing them.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Jared Slauson And I'm sure there's people that can give you
*  a modern take on what the benefits are and break it.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, but that's not what I'm asking you. What
*  I'm asking is why you believe the Bhagavad Gita is real.
*  Jared Slauson Sure. So, my point is there's reasonable amounts of faith in these other
*  things that I've applied that have made me take a next step. So, whether I believe it's real,
*  I just believe the truths I can extract from it are real. Whether the war actually happened,
*  there's a leap of faith.
*  Pete Slauson The benefits of those, of following those scriptures you apply and you feel those
*  benefits. So, that's enough.
*  Jared Slauson That's enough to make me move forward towards those.
*  Just for example, the idea of faith. And because especially in America, we don't like the concept
*  of blind faith. But if I saw you walking in downtown, let's take it the other way, you saw
*  me, you're driving, you're Porsche, and you saw me walking in Manhattan, and you say, hey, Ragu,
*  how do you get to Times Square? And I said, so, the first step is I could lie to you.
*  People lie all the time when you ask them for directions. But you have some reasonable faith,
*  I know him, he's a friend, why would he give me bad directions? So, there's a reasonable
*  amount of faith. But even still, people get into their egos and they just want to be the
*  knower of directions. But I say, you go up to 14th Street and you're going to see a McDonald's,
*  you take a right. Then you're going to go down all the way to,
*  whatever, can't even remember Manhattan anymore, Union Square and take a left and go up third.
*  And then at Union Square, you're going to see a park. At that park, you take a hard left.
*  So, again, you have some type of extended faith towards me, not blind faith, but you'd go up to
*  14th Street and there's that McDonald's. As you go to McDonald's or that next signpost, you realize,
*  okay, maybe he does know where he's going. Then you go farther, there's Union Square. Okay,
*  I think he actually knows what's going on. And all of a sudden you see the Times Square in the
*  distance. So, faith isn't just like, I believe. And if anyone was to say, I believe this, I believe
*  these V-Manas, I believe in mantras, I'd start to question them. But it happens with small degrees
*  of things being just shown to you that you want to take. All right, what's the next step here? What
*  do they say about this? What do they say about that? And then you apply and see, well, does that
*  work with me? And like I said, sometimes things didn't make sense. I remember when I first met
*  monks and they said, question about, or not even monks, but people were just like following very
*  strict with their sexuality, even in family. And the guy said, I don't have sex. I was 17.
*  I was like, you don't have sex with your wife? Are you crazy? So, no, we do other things. And I
*  just couldn't understand that as a 17-year-old boy or 18-year-old boy. I couldn't understand why
*  would you be with a person if not for that?
*  Well, what was his answer? What was their answer?
*  Because they said, we're practicing detachment. We're practicing going internal to find our
*  pleasure. And he said, I said, what do you do for fun? And he goes, you go for a drive?
*  I was like, you go for a drive? Are you crazy? But it was where this person was on his path of
*  really controlling the senses and finding his pleasure internally. At different, at time in my
*  life, it made no sense whatsoever.
*  Maybe he really didn't like having sex with his wife.
*  Maybe, or that, or that.
*  Or some sort of an excuse.
*  Or maybe there was-
*  Going internal, baby. And she's like, what? What's happening?
*  Maybe there was trauma. We don't know the whole story.
*  Yeah. I see what you're saying, though. Applying this stuff, whether or not you break it down
*  scientifically and objectively and try to analyze each and every word and whatever the
*  translation is, you could actually apply those truths, air quotes, to your life and have real
*  benefits.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. And other things are just, does it make a difference if Vimanas exist or not?
*  Yeah, it makes no difference in my practical life. Could they exist? Sure. It could. All these,
*  yeah, it could answer a lot. I think a lot of these things we talk about, like life on other
*  planets and aliens, they all are very much explained. Or here's another good one. What do
*  these spiritual paths have in common? We train ourselves to find the differences in all of them.
*  And the Vedic teachings say, don't you understand? You should be able to walk into a mosque,
*  into a church, into a synagogue and say, how nice, these people are trying to connect.
*  Not that we got to win these people over to our team.
*  Because they're all an illusion and they're all going to hell forever.
*  Right.
*  Everyone's on a type of path and I appreciate them trying to surrender. And the only thing
*  that's going to get in their way, because people say things like this all the time,
*  it's religion that caused all the problems in this world. And it's not religion, it's the ego
*  that goes with joining a particular church, synagogue, ashram, etc., that we have it our way.
*  And everybody else, they're a problem and we got to fix it. That's what gets in the way.
*  Because you could say materialism causes lots of problems as well in the world. So I don't think
*  it's, the ego's sneaky, it'll sneak into your diet, it'll sneak into your God, it'll sneak in.
*  And that's why there's an appreciation instead of a condemnation of people that are different than us.
*  Let's wrap it up right there. Those three hours, man.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah. Isn't that crazy?
*  That is crazy. Time flies.
*  We just started, man.
*  We kind of did.
*  I hope that it wasn't boring.
*  It was great. It was great. That's it, everybody. Thank you and Hare Krishna. Goodbye.
