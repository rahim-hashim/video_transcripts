# Joe Rogan Experience #1413 - Bill Maher
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [January 17, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KQGZa773sI)
*  Hello, Bill.
*  Great to be here in the man cave.
*  This is the professional extension of the man cave.
*  This part is a, this is where real work gets done.
*  This is the only part in the building.
*  It's worth it just to see it.
*  No, really, I thought I was, and I did not expect this.
*  But you know, as I was just telling you off the air, I invited myself on this show.
*  Yes.
*  Well, you requested it.
*  And I did.
*  I said, I would have invited you.
*  We're doing, we're coming back on the air, real time's coming back in a few days.
*  And we always do something to promote it.
*  I said, let's, let's do that show.
*  You know, I like that show.
*  Why can't I do the shows I listened to?
*  Wow.
*  Got that in Mexico.
*  You should put that in a, it looks like it should be a ring for a, for a, for a roadie.
*  For a roadie.
*  What, what season are you guys coming into?
*  Oh, fuck.
*  I don't know.
*  Seasons, it's hard to, I can just go by years.
*  We started on HBO in 2003, but then we used to do, for the first few years, they
*  had us do two seasons.
*  They took us, took them a while to get the idea that this is not like the
*  Sopranos or any other show.
*  This kind of show is a habit show.
*  It has to be on most of the year.
*  We used to do a season from February to like May, and then we'd be off for four
*  months and come back for a few months in the fall.
*  That's not the way you can do it when you're following events, a live show.
*  So finally somewhere in there, they just, okay.
*  So then it was one long season as opposed to two.
*  So I guess they counted the early years as two.
*  We've been on HBO since 2003, but of course I started, you were on the
*  old show, politically incorrect.
*  Somebody sent me a clip of that.
*  Wow.
*  I couldn't even bear to watch it just from the way we looked.
*  It was too sad.
*  Time is cruel.
*  It's actually, we look better now just because we look douchier, younger, of course.
*  I mean, that's the trade-off in life is that you're douchier when you're younger.
*  But you do look more pristine, shall we say.
*  Less beaten down by time.
*  Yeah.
*  But that started in 93.
*  So I've already passed my, we did a 25th anniversary show about a year and a half ago.
*  Yeah.
*  And the fall of 18 it aired.
*  I couldn't believe that.
*  Do you know they're trying to bring back politically incorrect?
*  Who is they?
*  Whoever the fuck they are, they came to me.
*  Yeah.
*  That's so funny.
*  Cause I suggested that a while ago with it, not with me hosting it, of course, but
*  with somebody else hosting it.
*  But I'll have to ask my manager about that.
*  I thought we, I guess we sold it.
*  I think that's true.
*  When we moved to ABC, it must be ABC.
*  When we moved to ABC, I think we probably sold them the rights to the show, which is,
*  was probably stupid, but at the time it made sense and well, good luck with it.
*  I'm not doing it.
*  It was one of those questions.
*  My manager calls me up and says, you're not going to want to do this, but I'm obligated
*  to tell you.
*  Why wouldn't you want to do it?
*  It just doesn't seem like something I'd want to do.
*  No, I'm insulted.
*  No, I'm just kidding.
*  I would never want to take over your show after you did it.
*  And then you got it stripped away for saying something.
*  The whole thing was like, once someone does a show, leave it alone.
*  You know?
*  Right.
*  Leave it to their moment.
*  Yeah.
*  Like if you left and they started doing real time with Adam Carolla.
*  Right.
*  You know, which is exactly what they will be doing.
*  It's just, you come up with a new fucking show.
*  You know?
*  Right.
*  Do you feel constrained by the time?
*  By the, the hour format?
*  Uh, sometimes I was on with Howard Stern recently and I was saying that to him and I
*  feel the same sometimes when I watch or listen to you.
*  Um, it's, it's funny, America, I don't get America.
*  Like people's attention span is either seven seconds or three hours.
*  Yeah.
*  There's no in between.
*  Well, there's a lot of us.
*  That's what it is.
*  This, this, I could do.
*  A lot of people.
*  Yeah.
*  They're playing to the people, the shortest attention span.
*  You say, this is all they have.
*  This is all that's there.
*  That's not true, but it takes a big risk to play the three hours.
*  I mean, there are virtues and vices to both of them.
*  I mean, I do like, um, being forced to condense, uh, and for people, I always
*  think of the person watching my show as the person who is interested in current
*  events, but doesn't have the time to follow it during the week.
*  They've got kids and jobs and lives.
*  They are going to watch me to catch them up.
*  Uh, and it's my job to obviously entertain them, but also to point out what's
*  important, what, what happened this week that you should know about somewhere in
*  that live hour, whether it's in the monologue or in new rules or the editorial
*  I do at the end or in the panel somewhere, I want to cover everything.
*  I think you should.
*  It doesn't necessarily mean it's the things that the newspaper or other
*  outlets thought was important.
*  What I think is really important.
*  That's what I'm going to cover.
*  So there is something to be said for condensing.
*  There's also a lot to be said for letting it breathe.
*  You know, I mean, letting it breathe.
*  I do miss that sometimes.
*  I wish I could, and very often we're in the middle of a discussion
*  and I have to move on.
*  I feel like with way things are going now with streaming, like I know HBO has
*  their new streaming service, maybe they could just give you an option to let
*  some, some of those conversations lengthen out.
*  It just seems like some of them, you're just getting started
*  and you have to cut them off.
*  You're right.
*  And again, sometimes people just want the headlines.
*  Very often I'm reading something and it's too long.
*  I just think you just, you should have given me the New York
*  Times starts every article.
*  Not just tell me what happened.
*  Don't give me the background and on a rocky road in Afghanistan, as
*  Fran Lebowitz once said, and remember, just get to the part I care about.
*  Right.
*  Movies are too long.
*  Lots of stuff is too long.
*  People need editors, but these kinds of conversations lend themselves more
*  than most art forms to just letting it happen.
*  And yeah, it's more natural.
*  I mean, I like the fact that unlike my early days when you'd sweat backstage
*  and you'd hear the tonight show band playing and it's like, you know, Johnny's
*  going to ask you this, and then you're going to say that and you're going to
*  do this and don't fucking veer from this.
*  You get in trouble and this is good.
*  I didn't prepare anything.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, obviously you didn't prepare anything.
*  No, I did.
*  You really have no list of questions.
*  No, no.
*  So what happened?
*  I know you, I like you.
*  Right.
*  I'm sure I'm not going to run out of things to ask you or talk to you about.
*  But that's a talent in itself that you could do that off the top of your head.
*  I think you think it's not that much of a talent, but trust me, a lot of
*  people could not do that.
*  I don't know if I would trust myself.
*  If you said you have two hours with this guy, I would, I would, it would be in
*  the back of my mind like, shit, what if an hour and 10 minutes in, I'm like,
*  fuck, I can't take a one more thing.
*  I can't imagine if you and I were at dinner together for two hours, we'd
*  run out of shit to talk about.
*  That's probably true.
*  So that's this.
*  Okay.
*  It's the same shit.
*  Followed by Dead Air, why?
*  Complete dead air.
*  Listen, man, I've been a fan of yours for a long time.
*  I bought True Story.
*  And I have you.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  I bought that book way back in the day, man.
*  I was living in New York.
*  It was a great book.
*  Thank you.
*  Very underrated book on standup comedy.
*  I appreciate that.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a novel.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, it's a novelization of my early life.
*  Very accurate though.
*  Like you could feel like you lived the life and the names were
*  hilarious of the characters you chose.
*  No, I worked probably harder on that than almost anything I've ever done.
*  I would never write another novel.
*  Well, just to make every sentence, every paragraph funny or telling, no extra
*  words, to me, that's the kind of.
*  What year did you write that?
*  I, it's funny.
*  I started it in the early eighties when I was still almost living it.
*  And I would get busy and put it aside and I'd look at it for years.
*  And then, uh, I did, um, this is my old life in 1985 in December.
*  I went down to, uh, Zihuatanejo, Mexico to do the memorable TV movie, TV movie.
*  There, there's a phrase that dates you.
*  The memory of a TV movie club met.
*  I think we all remember it.
*  No, we don't.
*  Linda Hamilton was the star.
*  I think I do remember it.
*  I hope you don't.
*  I remember Linda Hamilton in a movie.
*  Right.
*  With you.
*  Now I'm picturing it.
*  It was a TV movie.
*  Um, and, uh, we stayed at the club mad.
*  Um, I was in, you know, it was kind of a low budget thing.
*  As far as the people in the cast and crew went, because we stayed at the club med,
*  which was not a club.
*  That is not a luxury hotel.
*  You know what club meds are.
*  You, you, you give up your money, you pay everything in beads, but you
*  don't really need money and the room for people who just, you're going to enjoy
*  the outside, that's why you're in Mexico.
*  So the room is monastic, right?
*  There's no TV.
*  Cause you're out all day.
*  You know, you're just going to be in the waves and then you're going to
*  fuck and go to sleep and whatever.
*  So I had a lot of free time because I wasn't in the shot every day, but I was in
*  Mexico eventually I got fucking cabin fever down there, you know, I couldn't
*  wait to get home, but I was there a long time and had nothing to do.
*  And I wrote a lot of the novel there and put it away again.
*  And then I was in a real career slump in the early nineties.
*  I had finished with acting mostly.
*  I didn't want to do that anymore.
*  I'd done a few sitcoms and I didn't want to be the office creep forever.
*  And so I was just like nowhere.
*  And that's when I finished it.
*  And also that's like the year I did cocaine, which I probably would
*  not have finished it without that.
*  It was only one year.
*  It was one year.
*  I was never meant to do cocaine when everyone was doing it.
*  I never wanted it.
*  You know, me, I'm a pothead like you.
*  I, I, it's not my drug, but you know, if you really insist.
*  You can get in, you can get into any drug.
*  And I, and I just happened to be at this point in my life where I was
*  vulnerable to any, I had nothing to do all day.
*  I wasn't working.
*  So, uh, and it helps you, right.
*  It helps you.
*  It's a productivity drug.
*  It's a productivity drug.
*  I was, it was never a drug that I liked because I wasn't social on it.
*  But I could, I used to like to have sex on it.
*  Really?
*  Most men did not.
*  I love that.
*  And, uh, and right, but I didn't want to talk.
*  Some people are like, you know, that, that guy, I don't know.
*  It was never that guy who did coke and talk a blue streak.
*  No, but, but it helped me, you know, concentrate and organize
*  and that kind of stuff.
*  And, you know, and then I was probably smoking pot too.
*  I was smoking cigarettes.
*  It was not a healthy year.
*  That was not a healthy year.
*  I, I, uh, I remember, you know, you'd, because cocaine, which is kids,
*  that is the worst drug.
*  It really is because you get a little honeymoon period and then that quickly
*  goes away and then you're chasing that high and you know, it's not healthy.
*  And then, you know, you're, you're trying to, at the end of the night,
*  take the edge off, you know, you're into that, put the edge, I
*  gotta put the edge back on.
*  I took it off too much by drinking Jack Daniel's.
*  Ah, damn, now I gotta take it off again.
*  I put it on too much.
*  It's, it's, that was, I never touched it.
*  I got lucky.
*  You're very smart.
*  I would probably really enjoyed it.
*  I think I would have really enjoyed it.
*  Yeah.
*  That's probably why I didn't.
*  I, at the, at the, again, at the beginning, it's very much like a relationship cocaine.
*  Good at the beginning, you know, I think trails off.
*  I always say, there is a time when relationships are good.
*  Spoiler alert.
*  It's the beginning for a lot of them, for sure.
*  Now, when you put that book out, um, is it still in publication?
*  Another great question.
*  I'm finding so much about my own life here.
*  I didn't know politically incorrect was being redone.
*  Um, comics from my era, like guys who grew up and got a hold of that book when
*  we were just starting out, there was a, it was huge.
*  A lot of guys pass it around.
*  A lot of guys talk about it.
*  Hey, you gotta get this book.
*  Yeah, no, I mean, and I tried to make it into a movie.
*  Uh, there was many scripts written.
*  I mean, it's my own fault for not pushing that through, I guess.
*  But I thought at the time it would really would have made a, a good movie, but
*  it's probably too late now.
*  And you definitely have to change the names now.
*  It's very hard.
*  Yeah, I did in the script.
*  It's very, yeah, it's very hard to depict standup comedy in a movie.
*  In fact, one of the original impetus to write the book was that
*  no one was doing that well.
*  I remember that movie came out with Tom Hanks.
*  Remember that punchline punchline.
*  Okay.
*  And Tom Hanks was good.
*  I mean, Tom Hanks could, could have been a standup comic.
*  He did it as good as you can.
*  Passable.
*  Passable.
*  But they just never capture the whole essence of it.
*  And also when you're trying to have someone, I see this on, um,
*  Maisel.
*  No, I haven't seen that yet.
*  Some show.
*  Oh, the one, I think it's Jim Carrey's show on Showtime about,
*  Oh, I'm dying up here.
*  Thank you.
*  Yes.
*  And, uh, I like the show, but whenever you're showing a standup
*  comic and you're, and it's acting, you're acting as a standup and then
*  the audience has to laugh.
*  There's something about it that isn't, it just, you can tell it's not real.
*  It's like a boxing scene in a movie.
*  Same thing.
*  A little bit.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes.
*  Rocky.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  But that's sometimes purposely over the top.
*  This just comes off as fake because one thing we love about comedy is
*  that laughter is involuntary.
*  Yeah.
*  It's in, you can't, as any giant comedy star knows, you can walk out at a
*  comedy club and you'll get the biggest ovation in the world.
*  Two minutes later, you can be dying because it's involuntary.
*  Yes.
*  They're thrilled to see you, but then if you don't say something funny,
*  they can't, they're not going to laugh.
*  It's also a very uniquely live thing.
*  It's like, you have to be right.
*  I always say that like, if you watch a special on TV, you're really,
*  you're getting 60% of the funny.
*  You're right.
*  You have to be there live.
*  You, if you're there live, you'll get a hundred percent of it.
*  So not only that, not only you watching it not live, right, because you've
*  got a recording of it, but now it's also a fake recording.
*  So it's a guy pretending to be on stage and an audience pretending to be an
*  audience and the whole thing is a disaster.
*  Yeah.
*  So maybe it's a blessing in disguise that it never got made into a movie.
*  Of capturing the marvelous Mrs.
*  Maisel does of capturing like the early scene in clubs, like of her going up
*  drunk and talking shit and then people telling her like, you could probably do
*  comedy, like it seems chaotic and real, but it gets a little less realistic as
*  time goes on, but you watch that show and you like it.
*  Yeah.
*  I liked the first two seasons, the third season.
*  I'm like, I hope they're not losing me here.
*  And it takes place in the fifties.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I would watch something like that, except there's just too much.
*  The first one is just too much.
*  Too many things to watch.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I put it on my list, but you know, I'm going to get to that.
*  And does everything have to be like a season?
*  You know, does everything have to be so drawing back to our subject?
*  Everything is either very condensed or way too drawn out.
*  And you have to follow it.
*  And you're not like an episode of friends where you don't have to know what the
*  fuck happened the week before.
*  And you just tune in to Seinfeld.
*  It's not dependent upon the week before.
*  Right.
*  It's all the things in arc and people binge.
*  I don't binge.
*  I never binged anything.
*  I have the opposite problem.
*  I have watching ADD.
*  I, when I, I love to watch TV.
*  It's the last thing I do before I sleep at night.
*  Um, but unless something is absolutely compelling, I don't watch more than
*  15 minutes of it.
*  I'll watch 15 minutes of this and then 15 minutes of that and 15 minutes of
*  Mel's thing, and then go to sleep.
*  You know, people are structuring their Netflix specials that way because of that.
*  People are doing their closing bit first.
*  I read that somewhere that you have to, we have to grab them.
*  That's why every fucking drama is something.
*  And then six months earlier, you know, we have to go back because you have to
*  grab them first.
*  And then, and it's such a tired trope.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, it's like now that we've seen it a hundred times, think of something else
*  or just go really crazy and do something linear.
*  Well, it's, you know, this whole thing that you were saying before, we have a
*  second, uh, seven second attention span, or we have three hours.
*  I would love to see someone try to make a movie like Steve McQueen's Lamans.
*  Cause if you don't remember that movie, the old Steve McQueen, there's
*  no kids.
*  There was a Steve McQueen before the very talented director.
*  Oh, I didn't know there was a director.
*  Steve.
*  Yes, you do.
*  Who is he?
*  Was he?
*  Do he direct what you know, right?
*  You heard him.
*  He directed, he's an African American.
*  He directed 12 years of slave.
*  I believe.
*  Are you, are you using your magic light box to Google him?
*  And what else did he do?
*  He's a big director.
*  He's, he's a major, major guy.
*  That's Steve McQueen.
*  Oh, there he goes.
*  I didn't know who he is.
*  Um, shame, hunger.
*  Widows.
*  Yes.
*  He just did widows.
*  Never saw that.
*  Um, widows 12 years.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Anyway, I remember the old Steve McQueen too.
*  Yes.
*  The one who died of cancer in 1980, I believe.
*  I remember him chasing cures in Mexico.
*  Oh really?
*  Yeah.
*  Lung cancer?
*  Uh, I think probably, I think he probably was a heavy smoker and, um, but yeah, he
*  was, uh, he was, what about him?
*  The movie Lamonts is a really slow beginning.
*  There's no talking for like the first, I don't know how many minutes.
*  It's just, you know, people going about their life on the racetrack, like
*  all preparing for things and there's no chat.
*  Oh, you ever try to watch a Hitchcock movie?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Same thing.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it just shows how different the audiences are and how we have
*  developed or undeveloped.
*  I don't know if it's that, or if it's that there's an expectation that people
*  have a short attention span and so that everything is made for that expectation.
*  No, they do.
*  They do.
*  I think they, I do think they really do.
*  I mean, the more you, I do, I, I must say as someone who grew up when Alfred
*  Hitchcock was still, was he still making?
*  Yeah.
*  He made a movie in 1972.
*  I was 16.
*  I saw it in the theater.
*  It was one of his last, he was on his last legs, but Psycho was
*  1960.
*  I was too young for that, but he was still very in vogue and a big director.
*  And I tried to watch, I did watch the one he made in 1956, the year I was born,
*  called The Man Who Knew Too Much, I think.
*  It's a story he made three times.
*  He liked that story about the innocent guy who's being chased by somebody and
*  he doesn't know why they're chasing him and the police are after him, but he's,
*  he's got to find the bad guys before the police find him.
*  It's Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day.
*  It is, I mean, they talked about the master of suspense.
*  I mean, Jesus Christ, it was like the master of keeping me from falling asleep.
*  It's really subtle, slow.
*  I'm sorry, but I think they've improved on that.
*  Maybe that's sacrilege to the movie community and Martin Scorsese will write me a
*  letter or something, but Jesus Christ, I'd much rather watch Salt.
*  You know, there's a thriller that moves or Jason Bourne, those movies.
*  I feel like they took what Hitchcock was doing and yes, they revved it up and I'm
*  glad they did.
*  Hitchcock's hard to get through.
*  We also have to realize when Hitchcock was making films, they've been only making
*  films for 50 years.
*  It was a really, even less.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, he started in the late thirties.
*  Right.
*  You know, I mean, talkies had only been around for like 10 years.
*  That's crazy.
*  Way back.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So I mean, there's something about that, like, even when you think about standup,
*  like if you ever tried listening to Lenny Bruce.
*  I certainly have good example.
*  Yeah.
*  I can't do it.
*  Doesn't work anymore.
*  It's just contextually we're in a different world, but any of those old
*  schoolers, that's a point at the set.
*  Funny.
*  It's, it's in true story where I talk about how those guys who are such, um, icons
*  couldn't make it today because they take too long.
*  You could take, you could take two minutes before you got to the punchline.
*  You could take two minutes to set something up.
*  The audience was perfectly okay with that.
*  You could never do that today.
*  Jack Benny and Bob Hope was more rapid fire.
*  But a lot of these old schoolers, you know, I mean, I have a never funny list
*  and being a friend of mine created years ago and some of them are on it, you know,
*  Danny Thomas and I don't know, Red Skelton.
*  I mean, there's some people I thought were never Bill Cosby.
*  I must say something was on that list.
*  Really?
*  Oh yeah.
*  You never thought he was funny?
*  Never thought he was funny.
*  Even when he was doing Bill Cosby himself, like back at the album days.
*  And I may have missed some stuff he did, but everything I ever heard, even when
*  I was a kid and I saw him on TV, I'm like, no, I don't like this shit's corny.
*  I know I feel very, very, uh, ahead of my time.
*  I never liked him.
*  Well, it was one of those things where if you had said any of this that you're
*  saying 10 years ago, people would have been furious at you.
*  Well, but now these been exposed.
*  Somebody told me he was a creep back in 1983.
*  Ah, okay.
*  Someone told me in 94.
*  Yeah.
*  So I, and it was somebody I liked, not somebody I was romantically involved
*  with, but a girl who he was horrible to.
*  And, uh, I never liked him after that as a person.
*  That makes sense.
*  I had heard from people on the set of news radio that he drugged girls.
*  It was like one of those weird things you heard as a room.
*  Like, what does he do?
*  He drug girls?
*  Like Bill Cosby, Bill Cosby, Bill Cosby.
*  We're talking about the same guy.
*  It's not like Steve McQueen, Steve McQueen would get them confused.
*  Right.
*  No, I mean, America's dad, America.
*  And you have to wonder why a guy who could, um, get laid, uh, even as a married
*  man, um, that's obviously a sick kinky head, but I also know, uh, a guy who was
*  a promoter and, and told incredibly ridiculous stories about things that
*  Bill Cosby did that were not sexual, but just informed me that what his kink is,
*  is part of a much larger sickness about control and making people do weird
*  things because he can.
*  Let me tell you what I heard.
*  You tell me what you heard.
*  I heard he makes people watch him eat curry.
*  He would make the whole staff come into his dressing room and watch him
*  eat.
*  I hadn't heard that exactly, but it's exactly in line with what I heard that
*  he would, uh, do things like make you, um, what was one of them?
*  Like he would order food and then he would say, you know, uh, scoop out the,
*  uh, the doughy part of the hamburger bun after you wash your hands and put it
*  back on the hamburger, or once he asked them to send him the soap that he hadn't
*  finished using in the dressing room, like send it to send it to, yeah, just like
*  crazy, crazy shit that again speaks to a pathology that's larger than what we know
*  about him sexually that that fits as a subcategory under that, because to need
*  to have the woman be unconscious.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a, that's a weird thing.
*  I can't, I can't, I can't get into, I, I, there's certain things I'd like, I
*  can't even imagine why someone would find it attractive to be with a child.
*  I can't understand why that would be appealing to you.
*  I can't understand this, you know, a lot of things I can't understand.
*  Um, I worked at a casino and he made the security guard, tuck him into bed
*  and shut the lights off.
*  Things like, I'm going to lie on the bed and I want you to tuck me in, shut the
*  lights.
*  He had like a whole routine that he wanted them to follow and he wanted them
*  to tuck him into bed.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I had a friend who had an interesting take on it and he said, there
*  is something that happens to some famous people, particularly famous people who
*  were famous a long time ago where they feel like they are better than other
*  people.
*  There is a giant gap between them and other people and they feel like they can
*  do things to people.
*  And they, that, what?
*  Yeah.
*  I don't think that's uncommon, but his pathology, but most people try to hide
*  that, hide that feeling.
*  They try to, but I think he did, you know, it's called acting.
*  Yes.
*  That's why when they are in front of the camera, they're so charming, but we know
*  that behind the scenes they're, they're not, but he seemed to wear it on his
*  sleeve.
*  Well, sort of sometimes, right?
*  But the other thing that he was doing in publicly, he was trying to chastise
*  other comics for using bad words.
*  And, you know, he had a lot of weird control issues with that as well.
*  But my friend's take on it was that he thinks that there are people that they
*  get to this position where they think that they're owed things.
*  And he thought about that sexually too.
*  He said, he probably felt like he was just so above those women that he didn't
*  even want to negotiate with them.
*  He just drugged them and fucked them because he's Bill Cosby and they should be
*  happy.
*  Yeah.
*  It's crazy.
*  It's no, I mean, there's no,
*  the human mind is the bottom of the ocean.
*  It's mostly unexplored, but a giant mystery.
*  Well, especially that kind of scenario.
*  I mean, how many human beings have ever experienced what he's experienced?
*  He's been famous since the 1950s.
*  Right.
*  He was an American icon, rich beyond imagination, groundbreaker, and a
*  legitimate world-class stand-up comic who toured the whole world, created this
*  Cosby show that was a groundbreaking television show.
*  So many factors, so many factors.
*  And then on top of that, a psychotic pervert and a creep and drugging women.
*  I mean, on top, who knows what other fucking shit.
*  Probably not just that.
*  No.
*  You know, when someone's that fucked up, it's probably not just, they might find
*  like 30 dead cats in his backyard.
*  Who knows the fucking guys into.
*  Well, I, somebody told me, it just may not be true that he was drugging people
*  with animal tranquilizers, that that's, he had a vet's license or something.
*  And that's how, that's how he was.
*  Cause people were like, how did he get the stuff that he was using for the
*  knockout pills?
*  Would this, would it offend you if I put my feet up?
*  Not at all.
*  Why would it offend me?
*  It is a man cave.
*  Well, it's a man cave.
*  I don't want to ask it.
*  It's your place.
*  I want you to feel good.
*  I put my feet up here all the time.
*  Oh, great.
*  You got some loafers on purpose.
*  Those are your choice.
*  You wore those today.
*  I didn't even think about it.
*  See, that's why I'm saying I'm glad I did this because I don't have to think about
*  who my wardrobe, what I'm going to wear and is Johnny going to like me?
*  Oh boy.
*  Did you do the night show with Johnny?
*  30 times.
*  Holy shit.
*  1982 to 1992.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  30 times.
*  Yes.
*  Which just shows you that show was, when I, when I started to do it, there was such
*  a proliferation of comics that you could do that show 30 times and that didn't make
*  me famous.
*  I mean, it elevated me to a degree.
*  It legitimized you in show business, but that at one point, just doing the
*  tonight show once made you a star.
*  But part of what true story is about was the comics frustration that they came
*  along at a time when it wasn't that unique a thing anymore.
*  There was too many comics.
*  You couldn't swing a dead cat without hitting a comic.
*  Well, I have like in my Sirius XM radio in the car, the comic stations and I love
*  them.
*  I would listen very often see somebody's name.
*  I've never heard of this comic.
*  I'll never see it again.
*  Uh, they're doing, you know, they play four or five minutes of their routine.
*  It's very professional.
*  It's funny.
*  I'm laughing.
*  And who is this person?
*  This just seemed like an innumerable supply of very competent standups who have
*  funny bits about the ketchup bottle.
*  And I don't know any of them and I guess they have followings and
*  they obviously work.
*  Do you go to the clubs though?
*  Club?
*  Fuck no.
*  I haven't been to the clubs.
*  It's like, you go back to high school.
*  No, I go to the high school every day.
*  You do?
*  Yeah.
*  I work at the clubs all the time.
*  So does Leno and lots of, Seinfeld, Chris, I don't get it.
*  I don't know why.
*  I don't know why you want to do that.
*  First of all, cause my friends are there.
*  I like going there and talking to the other comics that are there all the time.
*  And, uh, I like to do it cause it keeps me sharp.
*  I do that lineup at the store.
*  There's 13 other comics on the list.
*  But I work the road.
*  I do that too.
*  Yeah, but I'm saying, but that's my, how I keep sharp as I, or as sharp as I can be,
*  uh, is well, also I gave up on memorization years ago.
*  First of all, with all the pot I've smoked, it just wasn't going to happen.
*  I've used what I call the poor man's teleprompter for, oh, it's got to be 20
*  years, which is I have a music stand on stage and then I have my notebook, which
*  has my bullet points and I don't think the audience even notices it after.
*  I, it's very, every five minutes, I'm very discreetly moving the page.
*  And, but that way, I don't have to memorize anything.
*  When I get home from the gig, I go through it.
*  I redo it in the computer, print it out.
*  And it's, it's, it's just been the greatest thing because I can say, I can
*  get to exactly what I want to say.
*  I hate comics who stand up there and go, what else?
*  What else?
*  It's like, fuck that.
*  You should know what else.
*  You never hear me say what else to it.
*  I know what else.
*  And I'm going to tell you, I'm going to try to condense it.
*  I'm going to give you the best show I can for 90 minutes and then leave.
*  Look, you certainly can do it that way.
*  Yeah, we all have our own ways.
*  Yeah, everybody's got their own way of doing it.
*  Yeah, we all.
*  I, I like to be around a lot of other comics, like a large number of
*  very good comics all the time.
*  I think you feed off each other.
*  Like I'm, I'm on the road all the time when I'm on the road and with my friends,
*  I, you know, I go and tour with other very funny comics.
*  But when I'm in town, I just like to be around as many as I can.
*  You should do my Hawaii gig one year.
*  You know, I have a steady, well, I ran into Natasha and Moshe did it last year.
*  Yeah.
*  I ran into them and Maui.
*  I was like, what are you guys doing?
*  They go, oh, we're working with Bill.
*  Oh my God.
*  Oh, in Maui?
*  Yes.
*  You were there?
*  Yes.
*  I was there with my family.
*  We were just, uh, vacationing.
*  Next year is the 10th.
*  It was like, it was like, uh, new years, right?
*  Yes.
*  I started this 10 years ago.
*  Nobody would book it.
*  They, they all said, uh, Hawaii's a dead market.
*  And I found this promoter, uh, who was like, okay, I'll try it.
*  And it worked.
*  Of course, Honolulu is a big city.
*  They're smart.
*  More than a million people there.
*  Yes.
*  And Maui.
*  So we do Maui on December 30th and we do, uh, New Year's Eve in Honolulu.
*  And there's always surprises.
*  And, um, this year Sarah Silverman did it and Bobby Slayton.
*  And we have some, some, sometimes some very well-known musicians who join us.
*  Uh, Woody Harrelson is also in Maui and plays with us a little bit.
*  It just, it's just-
*  Stephen Tye was in Maui too.
*  Yes.
*  I saw him there one year.
*  Um, but maybe you'd consider slumming and it's a great fun trip and you're with comics.
*  And, uh, I've never performed in Hawaii.
*  Every time I go there, it's just a chill.
*  Well, I'm going to hit you up on that.
*  Okay.
*  I stopped doing New Year's Eve shows on my own.
*  That's the great thing about it.
*  I always hated New Year's Eve.
*  What a shit day.
*  And the show is at eight o'clock.
*  So, okay.
*  We-
*  So it's just a show.
*  It's a regular show.
*  Right.
*  It's a regular-
*  Reeeeeeee.
*  Right.
*  No, exactly.
*  It's a regular show, eight to 10 or maybe a little after 10.
*  We always, the whole group sings smile at the end of it.
*  I made that a tradition, the old Charlie Chaplin.
*  Smile, though your heart is aching.
*  You know that one?
*  Sure.
*  Well, you'll have to learn it.
*  And-
*  Jesus, what a weird gig.
*  And, uh, well it's New Year's Eve.
*  You got to do something as you send them off.
*  It's only an hour and a half left in the New Year, in the old year.
*  And I feel like that was the appropriate song because it was a song written by a
*  comedian, Charlie Chaplin.
*  It's a hundred years old.
*  It was a hit in the fifties for Nat King Cole.
*  Michael Jackson, uh, redid it in the nineties, uh, when he was on trial for
*  child molestation, chose to do a song by Charlie Chaplin, the most famous child
*  molesters, that was Michael's way of-
*  Charlie Chaplin was a child molester?
*  Well, Charlie Chaplin, I think back then they didn't call it that, but yes, he
*  married-
*  I didn't know anything.
*  Yes, he married like, it was like Jerry Lee Lewis.
*  He was like with 14 year olds.
*  Really?
*  Charlie Chaplin, yes.
*  I'm don't think I'm talking at a school about Charlie Chaplin.
*  Can you conjure something up there on your magic light box, Jamie, and see if,
*  uh, see if there's information that-
*  What are we-
*  I believe you, I just didn't know.
*  The audience says child molester.
*  Yes, Charlie Chaplin, famous for, for that.
*  And, uh, you know, back then, I don't think they got you for it, but-
*  What did they do?
*  What was the legal age back then?
*  Possibly none.
*  Right.
*  They probably didn't have a law.
*  I don't know if they even had such a concept.
*  I mean, we're talking about an era before women, they weren't letting women vote
*  in the teens.
*  They didn't, women didn't vote till 1920.
*  I don't know if they were child labor laws.
*  Um, I just don't know.
*  Well, Priscilla Presley, wasn't she like 14 when-
*  Correct.
*  Yeah.
*  And that was-
*  So Elvis was a child molester too.
*  And that was the fifties, right?
*  Right.
*  And that, well, he, he went into the army in 58.
*  So that's when he met her in Germany.
*  Her father was a Colonel and she was 14.
*  And of course he was 25 and a giant rock star.
*  And he says to the Colonel, would you mind if I took your
*  14 year old daughter back to America?
*  She can live with me at Graceland and it'll all be good.
*  And the guy says, enjoy.
*  What the fuck was wrong with people back then?
*  Those are different human beings.
*  So it's not just a hundred years ago.
*  No, no, we're, we're, we're so different.
*  Just, just are.
*  I mean, I'm a little older than, oh, what's that?
*  16 year old Harris met actor Charlie Chaplin.
*  16 is not as disgusting as 14.
*  That's not even, I don't think the worst one of it.
*  That's a famous one.
*  I mean, is there a, like a Charlie Chaplin, the pervert or
*  a child monster?
*  Yes, there definitely is.
*  But yes, people died young back then.
*  I was thinking recently people were just rougher.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I mean, you and I, I think walk the same path very
*  often talking about, we, I think are progressives, but we have
*  short patients with some of the fragile woke bullshit.
*  Yeah.
*  And some of that is just the way you're brought up.
*  I think kids are coddled, you know, I think they're
*  indulged and that's the reason why they freak out over
*  microaggressions and stuff.
*  And some of that is just, I was telling some in this
*  story, not a, not apropos of this, just talking about
*  something else, but it just reminded me that here I'm a
*  kid who had, I think a normal middle-class upbringing.
*  I consider it an idyllic time.
*  Um, I consider it an innocence you couldn't buy today.
*  I mean, first of all, I grew up in New Jersey, uh, in the 60s,
*  there was no racial issues because there was only one
*  race in town.
*  That's just the way it was.
*  I'm not saying that's good.
*  It wasn't, but that's so there weren't racial issues.
*  There weren't drug issues.
*  I didn't, I didn't try pot in high school.
*  I may have, maybe there was a rumor that a few kids were
*  doing it, but that wasn't even a thing.
*  There wasn't even any like divorce.
*  It was really the land that time forgot, you know, it
*  was leave it to beaver land.
*  And I was telling someone this time, my father who
*  grew up in the depression, uh, cheap, I, you know, love
*  them dearly, but I don't think that's the wrong word.
*  And sent us to an army friend of his as the dentist.
*  And this is 1964.
*  I was eight and did not use Novacaine.
*  And I remember vividly, like he, I had like eight
*  cavities that had to be filled.
*  He said, if it hurts, raise your hand, you know, as
*  the drill went into, okay.
*  So they're drilling into me and then I'm riding
*  home up this big hill.
*  It was cold on my bike with the tears freezing on my
*  cheek.
*  So get to the dentist yourself.
*  First of all, they wouldn't do that today.
*  They don't let kids just be on their own.
*  Like get your ass to the dentist on your bike, get
*  home after they drill into you with no Novacaine.
*  And I'm saying I wasn't raised by bad people.
*  People were just rougher.
*  It was just a rougher time.
*  And I wouldn't recommend these things exactly
*  necessarily, although getting someplace on your
*  own, I don't think is the worst thing in the world,
*  but a little more of that.
*  Have you ever had Jonathan Haidt on your show?
*  Yeah.
*  His book, The Coddling of the American Mind is
*  exactly about that.
*  And he believes that you should let your kids
*  roam around and let them find their way home.
*  And there is a movement for that.
*  Yeah.
*  We, that's how I was raised.
*  I came home from school, fly into the house,
*  change into my play clothes, fly out the door.
*  My mother never said, where are you going?
*  What are you doing?
*  And, you know, we're gone.
*  Yeah.
*  And again, in Leave It to Beaver Town, there
*  was a six o'clock whistle.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  At the firehouse.
*  The whistle went off.
*  Time for dinner.
*  And then you, right.
*  And then you got your ass home when you heard the
*  whistle.
*  We didn't have watches or phones or, you know.
*  I don't want, I mean, I don't want to compare.
*  It's a, it's a different world for sure between
*  the way we grew up and the way they're growing up
*  today.
*  Um, I don't know what's better.
*  I don't know which one's better.
*  There's certainly a lot of whiny cry babies today.
*  Yeah.
*  But there's also a thing today where we're,
*  we're, we're giving them access to information
*  way quicker.
*  So there's gotta be, and this is, this is not
*  something that's been studied, right?
*  Like what happens to a young mind when it has
*  access to almost anything.
*  As soon as you get a phone, you're given 12
*  year olds, 13 year olds phones, and then they
*  have access to everything in the world.
*  Everything.
*  Porn.
*  Porn instantly.
*  Which I, you know, you're talking to a libertine,
*  but I do not think porn is benign.
*  I do not.
*  It is not benign.
*  Not, not the way it is now on the computer.
*  I mean, it's, it's rapey.
*  It's, um, it's, it's a.
*  What sites are you going to?
*  Any, any site.
*  I'm not getting the rapey porn, but I think it's
*  not benign because it's not.
*  It's not, it's domineering.
*  Yes.
*  It's a lot of things that I am not interested
*  in, even in my fantasies.
*  I was doing a bit about that in my last special,
*  like even in my fantasies, I don't want to choke
*  anybody.
*  I don't want to come on your face.
*  I mean, come on, coming on your face.
*  That's not rapey or domineering or I mean, I
*  find that off putting and gross.
*  It doesn't, that doesn't move me.
*  And the thing I don't get it, but that's half
*  of what Pornhub is.
*  Well, I think what half of it is now is a lot
*  of stepsister stuff as like stepfather,
*  step sister, step brother.
*  Cause people are trying to be naughty and
*  there's nothing naughty left.
*  Cause like the idea of porn originally was like,
*  I can't believe these people are having sex.
*  Like go back and watch porn from the eighties.
*  So they're just having sex.
*  Ass fucking choking, come on your face, spitting.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's gross.
*  And it's, and so I'm not surprised that kids
*  have mental problems.
*  Fucked up ideas of sex.
*  Yes.
*  I mean, what, what's a first date, a first real
*  date like when you saw, you know, a team of
*  Japanese businessmen come on some schoolgirls
*  face when you were 10.
*  Oh, you saw that one, the bus?
*  That's a rough one.
*  I think it was a flight attendant.
*  I don't think it was a schoolgirl.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, the, uh, there was a squid.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, there's always squids.
*  They're into octopuses, tentacles and shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's, it's not necessarily benign, but
*  neither is alcohol, neither is gambling.
*  I'm not saying it's a lot of other behavior.
*  Yeah.
*  But I mean, if I was a parent, yeah, it's an
*  issue.
*  Keep it away from kids.
*  There's also an issue that you don't tell kids
*  about it.
*  So they don't, they find out from other kids.
*  There's no discussion of what it is.
*  There's no like real, like no one in their right
*  mind would ever sit down and watch porn with their
*  son and say, this is what I want you to avoid.
*  Like, this is why I want you to avoid this.
*  But it's probably not the worst idea.
*  I mean, look, there, there comes a legality issue.
*  Like, uh, I mean, I don't even think it's legal
*  to watch porn with a 13 year old kid.
*  But if you, if you have a son and he's 13 and you
*  know, he's going to be exposed to these things,
*  you almost have a responsibility to talk him
*  through it and just give him some, to give him
*  some understanding of what it, what is the
*  landscape?
*  Here's a big one.
*  Why are these girls doing this?
*  Okay.
*  Here's something that people don't like to admit
*  that enjoy porn.
*  The vast majority of them have been molested.
*  The vast majority.
*  Of who has been molested?
*  Porn art, porn actors, porn stars.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  There was some study they did on, um, girls who
*  get into porn who've been sexually abused,
*  mentally abused and physically abused.
*  And it was overwhelming.
*  It was overwhelming.
*  I mean, obviously it's just anecdotal.
*  It's based on one group of people that they, I
*  don't know if it's the largest study.
*  It's not, not surprising at all.
*  No.
*  So they're, they're searching for acceptance
*  and they're, they're willing to do something
*  that's way outside the norm.
*  I'm sure there's just some girls are just really
*  promiscuous.
*  They're into sex and there's nothing wrong with
*  them.
*  They just love it and they love performing.
*  Right.
*  I think there's less of them than there are of the
*  girls who were probably abused.
*  And you know, maybe they turn a negative into a
*  positive.
*  I'm not saying they shouldn't do it.
*  I'm not casting any judgment, but I am
*  saying that you should understand what this
*  thing is.
*  Like what this, why, how come some people like to
*  fuck on camera and everybody else is afraid
*  the, you know, that you're going to see their
*  genitals.
*  I don't know about the watching porn with your
*  son, Joe, but
*  yeah, I wouldn't suggest it either.
*  I'm just saying, I'm kidding.
*  But, uh, what I would tell a kid, especially a
*  boy, um, is son, what you're seeing in porn,
*  don't think that women really like that because
*  they don't, they don't want to have somebody
*  come on their face.
*  Someone must.
*  We were talking, of course, someone likes
*  anything.
*  That's one of the bad things about the internet
*  is that you could, in the old days, if you were
*  some sort of weirdo pervert, you thought, and it
*  was, the world was better because you thought that
*  you were completely alone in the world.
*  Now, whatever your kink is, you could put it on
*  the internet.
*  You could write, you know, I want a hooker to shit
*  on me while I play with electric trains and
*  people in two minutes who are saying me too.
*  Yeah.
*  And that, I don't know that now you have a
*  community of electric train shitter on it.
*  Echo chamber.
*  Yes.
*  They're all enjoying shitting on you with
*  electric chains.
*  So that's all unhealthy, but, but I just don't
*  think that that would be my main lesson to a, to
*  an adolescent boy.
*  Okay.
*  We can't keep the porn away from you.
*  Just don't think that's real the way real women
*  are or what real women like.
*  I don't think they like Tinder either.
*  In fact, I watched some documentary.
*  I can't remember what it was called.
*  I think it was on HBO about dating on social
*  media.
*  And that was the main theme of it was women are
*  doing it, young women, but they don't like it.
*  And it's not surprising.
*  They don't like it.
*  Guys are of course wired very differently and
*  they just want to hook up and move on.
*  I read also an article about it and the, I think
*  it was in vanity fair and the, the woman says,
*  okay, she did it once.
*  She tried Tinder.
*  She goes to a hotel or meets a guy she had just
*  met over the phone and they fuck.
*  And then she said, as I was getting dressed, I
*  turned around and he was sitting on the bed
*  looking at Tinder.
*  Whoa.
*  You know, so he had just come and here he is
*  looking for the next fix victim and victim.
*  This is this is willing participant.
*  I would say, I'm not, I'm not saying how dare
*  you with the victim.
*  No, I'm not.
*  I don't mean I didn't mean, no, you're right.
*  She's the next, he's a predator.
*  She was a willing predator.
*  How dare you?
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  He's out there hunting.
*  Yeah.
*  Trying to get gals, but it's just what his
*  gals try to get the ladies.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, but women, it's not designed for women.
*  Sensibilities.
*  No, it's just not.
*  They had member Ashley Madison was the
*  cheating site and it was like, uh, 12,000
*  women and 126 million men.
*  It was like some crazy number like that.
*  And most of the women on it were hookers.
*  There's a lot of them that were fake.
*  They had like fake accounts.
*  Yeah.
*  That was hilarious when you have a, when
*  you have a dating site set up just for
*  people that want to cheat and then they all
*  get busted because someone hacks into it.
*  Like, do you fucking dummies use your real
*  name?
*  Like, Jesus Christ.
*  I mean, just, you ever read that book
*  Sapiens?
*  Yes.
*  Such a great book.
*  And he goes into the fact that monogamy
*  probably not what, what is wired in us.
*  It's the reason why there's so much
*  misery about relationships is it probably
*  wasn't that way in early man.
*  And I'm saying early man, like human,
*  homo sapiens, which haven't been on earth
*  that long.
*  There's no primates that are monogamous.
*  They've never found one.
*  Right.
*  And we are primates.
*  Right.
*  And, um, we probably had a system, system is
*  just how we were that was closer to the
*  chimps and where it was like communal
*  fatherdom, you know, you didn't really know
*  whose kid it was.
*  So there wasn't this possessiveness because,
*  you know, I guess the women fuck different
*  men in the grouping and there wasn't that
*  feeling of I own you.
*  Right.
*  And this pussy's mine and all that bullshit.
*  You had sex at dawn?
*  No.
*  It's basically about that.
*  Okay.
*  My friend, Dr.
*  Chris Ryan wrote it.
*  Okay.
*  Interesting.
*  Uh, that's, it's basically about that.
*  It's about how people behave, the
*  polyamorous relationships they had in
*  these primitive cultures and that before
*  DNA testing and before they understood
*  paternity, that's really what it was all
*  about is about the community would raise
*  children and everybody would rate and they
*  would, there was a lot of like shared sex
*  in between different people.
*  So much, so much of love is, I think,
*  possessiveness.
*  What people think is love.
*  It's not love, you know, and, and also you
*  make me feel good is not love either to me.
*  And they always say love is the thing that
*  has never been able to be defined.
*  I don't think it's that hard.
*  It's it's selflessness.
*  It's when I care for your happiness more
*  than my own, that's love in any kind of
*  relationship, man or woman, whatever.
*  At least as much as my own.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  And if, if you, if being without me would
*  actually make you happier, then I'm for that.
*  That's love.
*  That's not, that would not characterize most
*  of my early relationships, how I felt and
*  what I thought, what love was.
*  Well, it's interesting when we look at other
*  animals, right?
*  Because you blow me great.
*  Monogamy in other animals.
*  In other animals, monogamy isn't a choice.
*  Like the animals that are monogamous, they
*  don't have any desire.
*  Like it's naturally built in, wired into
*  their system.
*  It's not like they choose.
*  Like swans.
*  There's a bunch of them.
*  Penguins, for instance.
*  Penguins.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a few.
*  Penguins are gay.
*  We know that.
*  They all look the same.
*  They might as well be gay.
*  Aren't there gay, wasn't there a big.
*  Thing about gay penguins?
*  Well, there was a story I feel like about
*  gay penguins or.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  There's something, cause I feel like the
*  usual suspects on the right.
*  Yeah.
*  Look up Charlie Chaplin, gay penguins.
*  Fucking.
*  Fucking kids.
*  Smile.
*  There's something, they were, maybe it was a
*  story, something that made the evangelicals mad.
*  About penguins?
*  Yeah, about penguins.
*  I think it's penguins.
*  Maybe it's they were in.
*  My point would be that any of these animals
*  that are doing this, they're not doing this
*  because they have a choice.
*  They understand what it is.
*  Oh, New York Times.
*  Gotcha.
*  Gay penguins and their hope for a baby have
*  enchanted Berlin.
*  Two male penguins at the zoo Berlin have adopted
*  an egg.
*  That's it.
*  That's what it is.
*  Two male penguins adopted an egg.
*  People are upset.
*  Delighting Germans, but upsetting Pat Robertson
*  big time.
*  Oh, was he bummed out about that?
*  Yes.
*  Somebody like that was, or all of them were.
*  I'm sure the family council, those types, you
*  think they want to have the example of penguins
*  being gay?
*  I wonder if that leads to.
*  Even give a fuck or if it's just a hustle at
*  this point.
*  Do you think they really give a fuck about
*  these penguins being gay?
*  I think they have to say something because it's
*  some new thing to talk about and it gives them
*  fuel.
*  For outrage.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a juicy story in the news.
*  They could jump on.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, Pat Robertson is it that he's still on TV,
*  right?
*  He's a, he needs material like you and I do.
*  Yes.
*  That's what I'm thinking.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You never know with these people.
*  Gay penguins.
*  That's where, that's where you draw the line.
*  It's where I do.
*  That's enough.
*  Their, their, their agenda has moved over to the
*  penguins.
*  Such a strange time.
*  So the strange time where like, where I feel
*  like if you read Steven, Steven Pinker stuff and
*  talks about how this life has never really been
*  easier than we have it today.
*  Right.
*  But it's also probably one of the reasons why
*  people are so outraged about things today is
*  just, there's, it's so, there's less real shit
*  that's dangerous in this world.
*  There's less, there's still is real danger.
*  It's still is real murder and real rape and real
*  robberies, but there's less of it than ever
*  before.
*  But yet there's more outrage than ever before
*  about nonsense things.
*  Well, when societies get too successful and you
*  could make that claim about America, that's when
*  they become a feat and that's when they become
*  soft.
*  Yes.
*  And that's when they fall.
*  This is a story that goes back to ancient Rome
*  and other societies.
*  You, you're, you're a victim of your success in a,
*  in a large way.
*  We're, we're that because yes, people don't, we're
*  just talking about how people were rougher.
*  Yeah.
*  No, novocade, you know, that wasn't even the
*  roughest thing.
*  We don't know hardship except for that sliver of
*  the country that fights the wars.
*  Those people know hardship.
*  Of course we do have poverty in America, but
*  there's also a fairly substantial safety net
*  that this country has.
*  I mean, nobody.
*  In comparison to other parts of the world, but
*  you know, there's parts of the world that are
*  really with crime and gangs.
*  Oh, those, those people deal with real hardship.
*  Oh, real hardship.
*  Those are the people coming from central, those
*  central American countries that they always are
*  freaking out about the Trump administration
*  because yes, when gangs rule the country in El
*  Salvador and Honduras, those places, life is
*  precarious and easy to lose.
*  Yeah.
*  But I know Steven Pinker's point, you know, which
*  is a great point is like, let's not forget that
*  in the last 20, 30 years, the amount of people
*  we've risen out of extreme poverty, the people
*  who used to live on a dollar a day.
*  Um, it wasn't that long ago when I read this, that
*  a billion people defecate in the street, you know,
*  that's where they poop.
*  That's all improved greatly.
*  Now part of the reason why Trump people are upset
*  about jobs and stuff and going overseas.
*  Well, that's part of the reason why is because
*  we lifted out of extreme poverty, people all over
*  the world, but they took those manufacturing jobs.
*  That's why they're not living in extreme poverty
*  and why they're not pooping in the street
*  because they're making Trump ties as opposed to
*  somebody in Ohio.
*  So pick your poison.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, this is like what we're talking about
*  with us growing up that life was rougher and life
*  is easier today, but you have more access to
*  information.
*  So maybe it could be better.
*  And then things seem to be moving in a better
*  direction in terms of things being safer, less
*  violence, less crime, less rape.
*  And then people also get upset at you bringing up
*  those statistics.
*  That's where it's really interesting.
*  If Pinker gets attacked for just stating
*  statistical facts, just say, and he's not making
*  value judgments.
*  He's just saying, Hey, things are, if you look at
*  the overall numbers of things, this is the
*  safest time to be alive ever.
*  It's and the people know, but what about this?
*  What about that?
*  Like, it's a horrible hallmark of our era that
*  we live in that facts almost always come second.
*  Yes.
*  Your political agenda comes first.
*  Yeah.
*  And if it doesn't fit in, then we don't want to
*  hear those facts.
*  And that's the left and the right.
*  It is the left and the right.
*  It's both.
*  And it's, it's, it should be, it should be
*  something that everybody rejects.
*  It should be something that angers everyone.
*  It shouldn't be tied to one party or another
*  party.
*  And it really should be something that if there's
*  a, there's a real problem with communication in
*  this society, one of them is the denial of actual
*  facts and information.
*  If we, we, if we know things, we have rock
*  solid statistics, whether it's about climate
*  change, whether it's about war, the budget,
*  whatever the fuck it is.
*  If you have a real number and you want to spin
*  and deny and like that, that's a giant problem.
*  It's a giant problem.
*  Right.
*  I get madder at the left because I want them to
*  be better and they should be better.
*  And they're the, they're the science party and
*  they're supposedly the fact people.
*  I expect this shit from the right, denying
*  climate change and so forth.
*  They've been doing that for a long time.
*  The left has this dirty thing.
*  If you disagree with them in any way, you become
*  an alt right person.
*  Like, I mean, it's obviously a small sliver
*  or a race is doing this.
*  Yeah.
*  Boy, I got stuck in this alt right category.
*  I'm like, you guys are out of your fucking mind.
*  I've never voted right in my life.
*  Right.
*  I know, but there's a, there's a, I feel like I'm
*  sure as you do sometimes a man without a country
*  and there's a group of a Sam Harris, people you've
*  had on Jordan Peterson, Barry Weiss, you know, I
*  just, we're all progressives, but sensible
*  progressive, real progressive, real
*  progressives.
*  We're not blindly ideological to our party.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  And we don't chase these virtue signalers who are
*  always, as a friend of mine said, they wake up
*  offended.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, and I, I'm always reading a story like
*  daily, I read something and what goes through my
*  mind is this country now is completely binary.
*  There's only two camps.
*  We're totally tribal.
*  You're either red or blue, liberal or
*  conservative and everything that one side does
*  that anybody does that represents that side has
*  to be owned by that entire side because people
*  will go, you will, you're the party of, so
*  whenever there's something on the left that's
*  cuckoo crazy, we all own it.
*  And that's one reason why Trump won.
*  Sure.
*  Because people, you go through the polling, his
*  fans are not oblivious to his myriad flaws.
*  What they love about him, what they all say they
*  love is he wasn't politically correct.
*  It's, it's hard to measure how much people have
*  been choking on that political correctness.
*  They do not want to walk on eggshells.
*  Yeah.
*  They do want, do not want to think that one
*  little misstep and it'll get fired or it'll be
*  castigated.
*  And these are not just famous people.
*  I mean, these are just regular people.
*  And I think when someone reads the kind of
*  stories you see every day and it's an eye roll
*  and it's a eye roll at the left, that's when you
*  lose people.
*  I'll give you an example.
*  I was about two weeks ago, the giants, my football
*  team, the New York football giants cut, I think
*  his name is Janoris Jenkins.
*  Are you using the R word?
*  Yes.
*  We have to say the R word?
*  No, you can say retarded.
*  Okay.
*  Well, we're just, we're not saying it.
*  I don't know what the fucking rules are.
*  Yes.
*  And he, he, okay.
*  First of all, I don't understand why that
*  generation feels the need to engage with their
*  fans on Twitter, but he was, and some guy.
*  Someone needs to teach him social media.
*  Some guy was criticizing him and he's a good
*  cornerback or safety, whatever he is.
*  And the, was criticizing him and he answered
*  back again, I don't know why, but saying, here
*  are my stats.
*  I'm pretty good.
*  I only can do my job.
*  Right.
*  And the retarded.
*  Okay.
*  Wait, you missed the point.
*  You missed part of the story.
*  I'm going to explain.
*  So then the guy, the fan says, well, what does
*  it matter?
*  The team is losing.
*  And that's when Janoris Jenkins said, I can
*  only do my job retard and cut.
*  Like cut from the team.
*  Cut.
*  Like the next day.
*  And first of all, I think he said it's something
*  that I thought it was a hood thing, you know,
*  maybe Janoris Jenkins didn't get the memo
*  because he's not, you know, like on Twitter 24
*  7 and living with the wokesters that we don't
*  do this anymore.
*  I think they offered him a chance to apologize.
*  And he said, I think he did.
*  Did he?
*  I think he did.
*  He did after they cut him.
*  But yeah, I don't think he like stood, I
*  insist on saying this where, but you know, there
*  seems like there's no room anymore for someone
*  just to go, oh, sorry, I didn't realize this was
*  such a thing because, you know, they do move the
*  goalposts often and they like to because it's
*  easier to catch people that way.
*  So how about just, oh, sorry, I guess, you know,
*  we don't do this anymore.
*  My bad.
*  And move on with our lives instead of no, you're
*  canceled, you're cut, you are irredeemable.
*  Yeah, it's hard.
*  It's ridiculous.
*  It's ridiculous.
*  And what I'm saying is like every day there's some
*  story like that.
*  And it just all goes into the bin left wing.
*  And that's when people go, you know what?
*  Trump's an asshole.
*  I don't like him, but I don't want to live in that
*  world.
*  These people are even fucking crazier.
*  Yeah.
*  And that is the great danger of reelecting him.
*  And they're very well may do it.
*  Yeah, it very well may.
*  Yeah.
*  This over correction, overreaction and things
*  like that infuriates people and they, they love it
*  when Trump says crazy shit because it sounds like
*  something that they would say.
*  It's trolling.
*  Like he had that one speech where he's talking
*  about China.
*  This is the way you talk to China.
*  They say, listen, motherfuckers.
*  Yeah.
*  Everybody went, yeah.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Like just that alone.
*  Like I even laughed and clapped.
*  I was like, that's fucking hilarious because that
*  is what you would hope some crazy version of a
*  president would say that would never really exist.
*  But all of a sudden he exists.
*  He sometimes he says something that I totally do
*  not want a president to say, but if he wasn't
*  president, like for example, when he was
*  confronted may have been by Bill O'Reilly when he
*  was still extant about Putin killing journalists
*  or something.
*  And Trump said something like, well, we're not so
*  innocent either.
*  Yeah.
*  Now I don't think the president of the United
*  States should say that, but you know who else says
*  that?
*  Noam Chomsky.
*  Yeah.
*  That's like something Noam Chomsky says.
*  America's guilty of also doing these horrible
*  things.
*  We're not innocent either.
*  Yeah.
*  He would be a little bit more articulate about it,
*  but yeah.
*  Right.
*  But the point is that no one judges anymore by the
*  content of what they say.
*  It's just by whose team are you on.
*  Yeah.
*  So if you liked it when Noam Chomsky said it, you
*  shouldn't hate it that much when Trump said it or
*  vice versa.
*  If you hated it that Noam Chomsky said it, then you
*  should hate it that Trump said it.
*  But that's not how people react.
*  Well, the team thing is so prevalent that even when
*  he does something militarily, like backs out
*  of a country, you see people on the left
*  criticizing him for not going in or not engaging.
*  Like, Jesus Christ, you guys are supposed to be the
*  people that always don't want war.
*  And when someone who's the president does something
*  that's not a move towards war, we should all be
*  saying, yes, please, more of this.
*  He's got a good thing.
*  Here's a good thing.
*  It's not like we want to categorize people as being,
*  like you said, one or zero binary, irredeemable,
*  like either chosen or irredeemable.
*  And you have to be very careful with how you talk
*  or you get labeled in one or two of those categories.
*  And people are so scared now.
*  Communicate.
*  It's I had a conversation with a friend a while
*  back and he was crazy conversation.
*  It was alcohol involved, but he said something
*  really ridiculous.
*  He was saying that maybe it's good that women get
*  so much money in divorce because of all the shit
*  they've been through from men over the years.
*  And I was like, what does that have to do with money
*  and divorce?
*  Like, if that's an individual person that's getting
*  money from another individual person, is she
*  getting, is she collecting?
*  Is this like reparations for all the horrible
*  things that have happened for women?
*  And he goes, well, and so he starts getting
*  defensive.
*  He goes, well, what about income inequality that
*  women have to deal with?
*  I go, oh, Jesus.
*  I go, well, you know, that's not real, right?
*  And he goes, what do you mean?
*  I go, it's not like they have the same jobs.
*  It's not like both women, the man and a woman are
*  both male men.
*  They both do the same amount of houses, but the
*  man makes a dollar when the woman makes 70 cents.
*  He goes, that's exactly what it is.
*  I go, the fuck it is.
*  That's not what it is.
*  It's illegal.
*  It is illegal.
*  We've already passed that law.
*  Everybody walked on eggshells.
*  Everybody was like, oh, Jesus, what are you saying?
*  Right.
*  You're saying income inequality is not real.
*  Right.
*  No, it's not, not, not that it's not real.
*  There's so many of those mic drop phrases that
*  they use, you know, kids in cages, which of course
*  we don't want kids in cages, but there's a whole
*  discussion to be had about immigration as opposed
*  to just kids in cage or Islamophobia.
*  Of course, that is a real thing.
*  It exists, but there's a whole other discussion.
*  But just these, look, the left often uninformed.
*  Yeah.
*  They just are.
*  But they have these bullet points that they feel
*  like they definitely can shut a conversation down.
*  That's what I mean.
*  They don't feel like they have to learn a lot about
*  a subject because you have these mic drop sayings
*  or phrases that just stop people from talking.
*  Well, I'd fortunately known the actual statistics.
*  And so when we were talking about it, I was saying
*  they'll know they choose different jobs.
*  And also they negotiate for themselves differently.
*  Yes.
*  They need to negotiate for themselves better.
*  Well, that's one of the things when people
*  accuse Jordan Peterson to be in sexist, you know,
*  Jordan Peterson literally counseled and coached
*  women how to be more assertive in their jobs to
*  get better raises.
*  Sure.
*  It was really explaining how to do this and just
*  even maybe possibly against your better instincts
*  to assert yourself and show that you understand
*  your value.
*  And this is what men do.
*  And this is why men get raises.
*  And oftentimes women just kind of keep it to
*  themselves and they're a little nervous about it.
*  But it is amazing.
*  I mean, you mentioned divorce.
*  Yeah.
*  They don't assert as well going for a raise, but
*  boy, the divorce thing.
*  I mean, that can go both ways if the woman is the
*  one who has more money.
*  Yeah.
*  But when the fuck does that ever happen?
*  That's like women who beat up men.
*  You know, women beat men up too.
*  Like when I hear that, I'm like, Oh my God.
*  Go to the gym.
*  Yes.
*  You should go to the gym, man.
*  It's like these fucking men's rights.
*  Assholes are like, there's so much to make fun of
*  men's rights guys.
*  But I had one of them on my, one of my comedy
*  specials had a bit about it where they were saying,
*  do you know that men get raped more often than
*  women?
*  I go, yeah, by other men, you fucking idiot.
*  Exactly.
*  Like, I remember that.
*  Yeah.
*  Chicks are out there raping dudes.
*  What do you think?
*  Cheerleaders are out there, raping cops.
*  Uh, have you had Christina Hoffs-Somers?
*  Yes.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah, I love her.
*  Yeah, I love her too.
*  She was on our show recently and you know, we
*  were talking about the fact that also they don't
*  bring up a lot of the time that most of the
*  horrible dirty jobs in the world are done by men.
*  Yeah.
*  They're the ones who are up on the telephone
*  pole.
*  Most likely to die on the job, most likely to be
*  murdered, most likely to go to jail.
*  Yeah.
*  Most likely to get a much longer jail sentence
*  for the same crime.
*  So we're not crying about being men.
*  We're just saying, as she says, life is a complex
*  mixture of advantages and disadvantages.
*  Yeah.
*  I think the pendulum is swinging the other way
*  though.
*  I think really dumb statements like fuck all
*  white men, like we used to hear on Twitter and
*  people used to like applaud and retweet it.
*  I think people are now like, oh, come on, what
*  the fuck?
*  Well, that's a little out there, but I have heard
*  when now it's going in the other direction
*  because the race is winnowing.
*  But at the point of say six months, a year ago,
*  when lots of people were getting into the race,
*  at some point there were 24 Democrats in there.
*  And when a white guy would get in, it was very
*  common to hear, do we need another white guy?
*  Yeah.
*  And that was completely okay.
*  Yeah.
*  On the left.
*  And it's like, okay, but then we are saying that
*  we're using race to judge whether someone is
*  qualified.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Exactly.
*  We are using race and gender to say whether
*  someone is qualified, just so we understand what
*  we're doing here.
*  Because I don't think that's exactly what Martin
*  Luther King meant when he said judge by the
*  content of their character and not the color of
*  their skin, which seems to elude a certain segment.
*  What's the dumbest form of identity politics and
*  it's really ridiculously dumb when they don't
*  realize that that same sort of strategy is going
*  to come right back around at you.
*  It's like people that think that, oh, that guy's
*  pissing me off.
*  I'm going to go fucking punch him.
*  Well, guess what?
*  He's going to punch you back.
*  Like this is not, it's not that simple.
*  When you, if you go around judging people based
*  on their gender and their color and their race,
*  guess what?
*  They're going to do that to you now.
*  Like this is, it's a terrible strategy.
*  I want to, I want to know how the divorce laws
*  came to be.
*  I do.
*  I want to know, I, somebody must have written a
*  book on it.
*  I just want to know how we got to this place where,
*  um, you know, first of all, this idea that you
*  have to live in the style of which you've become
*  accustomed.
*  I can help you here.
*  I can help you a couple, couple ways.
*  Here's the big one.
*  Lawyers make a lot of money if there's a large
*  settlement.
*  So it's lawyer.
*  Yes.
*  Lawyers don't make a lot of money if there's no
*  settlement.
*  You know, Phil Hartman, when he was getting
*  divorced, one of the things that he said to me, I
*  go, dude, just fucking give her half.
*  Come on, man.
*  You make a lot of money.
*  He goes, it's not half.
*  It was crazed.
*  He's like, it's two thirds.
*  He goes, the fucking lawyers get a third.
*  It's goddamn scam.
*  And I've had friends that have gotten divorced.
*  And even though they were, they had come to an
*  agreement with the X like let's listen to this,
*  this, and you'll get this and I'll get this fine.
*  Then the lawyers jump in, he's trying to fuck you.
*  And this is another, they're trying to fuck you
*  over.
*  You deserve more.
*  That's exactly the plot of the movie marriage.
*  Have you seen marriage?
*  No, I haven't.
*  Oh, it's terrific.
*  I was again at, at the beginning because it was
*  about an actress and a theater director.
*  And I was like, Jesus fucking Christ.
*  Can't you at least pretend that there are people
*  in America, not outside of your exact circle.
*  There've been so many big movies, you know, that
*  are just about your world of show business.
*  Have a little creativity.
*  Make them something else.
*  But okay, I got over that.
*  And then it's just a terrific movie about it.
*  There's no bells and whistles.
*  It's just, we're married.
*  We seem very happy and then, well, we're not happy
*  and we're going to get divorced.
*  And then, um, we're going to, let's just do it
*  amicably and not getting lawyers involved.
*  And then it all falls apart.
*  And once it goes down that path that you're talking
*  about, it just becomes as vicious as anything
*  without guns.
*  Well, I had a friend who got divorced and no, no
*  family.
*  Okay.
*  No children.
*  They didn't have children.
*  And, uh, it dragged on for more than I think almost
*  three years.
*  And even though they had come to some sort of
*  conclusion, he was paying for his wife's lawyer.
*  I go, it's like you're paying for the general of
*  the army that's trying to kill you.
*  You're paying for someone to fuck you in the ass.
*  Yeah.
*  You're getting fucked in the ass.
*  It broke him.
*  It's, I have seen so many men.
*  Broken by every time somebody says, uh, you
*  know, they, people unfortunately get a horrible
*  disease like cancer.
*  And they say, I couldn't have gotten through it
*  without my wife.
*  I always think, yeah.
*  And maybe she gave it to you.
*  I don't mean, of course, literally, but I just
*  mean that when you're in a bad relationship, the
*  stress, uh, we don't know what contributes all the
*  things to cancer, but, uh, that certainly is, I'm
*  sure one of them.
*  And then going through a divorce like that, I've
*  seen people like, like you say, just broken.
*  They get wrecked and it's a system.
*  The reason why the divorce laws are set up the way
*  they're set up, people think, oh, we're
*  protecting women horse shit.
*  They're doing it so that they can extract the
*  maximum amount of money out of the mail.
*  That way the lawyer gets the biggest chunk that
*  they could possibly get.
*  Most lawyers have a, they're working on a
*  percentage basis, especially if a woman doesn't
*  have as much money or if she's, you know, the, the
*  loyal come to her.
*  Look, we've got a deal here.
*  We'll, we'll figure this out.
*  Don't pay me now.
*  We're going to make sure we get, get you the most.
*  We'll, we'll take care of it all in the end.
*  And this is what has happened to several of my
*  friends that have been divorced.
*  And you know what it is.
*  Once you see it, what I get and I understand and I
*  accept and I, uh, I support is child support.
*  I mean, I've, I grew up with a deadbeat dad.
*  My dad never paid for shit.
*  And I have many friends that have also
*  experienced a lot of financial hardship growing
*  up because their dad was a piece of shit and, and
*  didn't want to pay for their children.
*  But people are very close to me, including my
*  wife, but when there's a big difference between
*  that, a man taking responsibility for his
*  children, there's a big difference between that
*  and alimony.
*  Alimony is creepy.
*  There's something creepy about like my friend,
*  like I said, didn't even have a child with this
*  woman.
*  He is still paying her by the way.
*  This is the same guy, very good friend of mine has
*  been divorced for 14 years, has been married for
*  12 to a new woman, still paying the old woman.
*  And my joke was like, you fucked her so hard.
*  She can't work.
*  Right.
*  Like she literally can't work because he he's a
*  wealthy man.
*  He made good money and he works really hard.
*  He's a, he's, he's not in the business.
*  He's a, he, you know, he has a real job and he
*  works, you know, long fucking hours every day.
*  And he has his own business and he has to pay
*  hundreds of thousands of dollars to someone he
*  doesn't even talk to anymore because he used to
*  fuck her.
*  Guys couldn't jam.
*  I knew of a guy who was a doctor who went to jail
*  every night because he couldn't make the payments
*  and they would like let him out on weekends to do
*  rounds and stuff.
*  But he was, it's,
*  I got a better one for you.
*  Want to get in great?
*  Yeah.
*  Hit me.
*  Dave Foley, who was on news radio when he was
*  getting divorced was when he was on news radio.
*  So it was a very, a financial peak.
*  You know, he was the star of the show.
*  He's making a lot of money.
*  And so his payments were set up for that.
*  Sure.
*  So this is in Canada, right?
*  And he, the judge tells him, he tells the judge,
*  I don't make that kind of money anymore.
*  That was an extraordinary time in my life.
*  It's very hard to make that kind of money.
*  You know, I'm an actor.
*  I just, the doctor, the judge rather says your
*  ability to pay has no relation to your obligation to pay.
*  Wow.
*  Think of that.
*  Just pause here for a moment.
*  What a statement.
*  You're where else would we say that?
*  It's insane.
*  And we're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars,
*  hundreds of thousands, like as if he's supposed to conjure this up,
*  like his career is supposed to magically resurrect itself in some
*  really financial viable way.
*  Is usually the man still who probably has the more money and is paying the woman.
*  Yes.
*  It's very anachronistic to how we have come to think about women as equal
*  and strong and able to do everything we can do.
*  But when it comes to this, it's like, Oh, we got to take care of them.
*  Well, they're suddenly they're, they're very dependent.
*  I think it's a scam that's set up because the men in general are in control of
*  the finances or make more money and they can extract more money from them.
*  That way turning it down.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, that's, that's why the system I think is set up the way it's set up.
*  It's, it's dark, man.
*  I mean, the only time it's happened the other way that I know of is Tom Arnold.
*  Tom got a great clean.
*  Sure.
*  Yes, it does.
*  It does happen the other way.
*  He's one for the males.
*  We got one on the board.
*  There's like, if the board was like here, it was, it would be a fucking
*  billion scratches on one side and four lines and the one through it.
*  And then next to it is like Tom Arnold.
*  That's why I never, I never understood the concept of marriage because when
*  people would say, why don't you want to get married?
*  I'd say, why would I invite the federal and state government into my love life?
*  It's very important.
*  Well, you have to have it.
*  Otherwise it's not real.
*  If you don't get it, a signed piece of paper, what the fuck do you have?
*  Just your feelings for that other good enough.
*  Well, how should I tell her friends?
*  She's got to tell her friends that he really cares.
*  You've been brainwashed by.
*  He really cares.
*  You think I'm serious?
*  I can see she's trained you to say the right answer.
*  Well, I think that's how crazy, I think that's a crazy backward way to look at
*  it, that without the piece of paper, it's not real.
*  It's not real.
*  Whatever you have with this, I'm an emotionally, uh, that's what's real.
*  The paper is what's fake.
*  The paper.
*  You shouldn't be worried about divorce because we're never getting divorced.
*  So I don't know what the fuck you're doing.
*  Like why, why are you getting so upset about this Bill?
*  Just sign the paper and get married.
*  We're going to be together forever.
*  I don't know what you're worried about.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  You're freaking out about, don't you love me?
*  You're freaking out about a divorce.
*  We're not getting divorced.
*  We love each other.
*  God sign it.
*  Sign it.
*  And then when you sign it, the darkness clouds roll over.
*  Ha ha ha ha.
*  But also like humans change.
*  It's like, we, it's so funny when you're, you could say about anything else.
*  Oh, I'm not married to it.
*  You know, do you want that thing there?
*  I'm not married to it.
*  But with a human, the thing that's most malleable, we're like, uh, yep, I'm going to marry it.
*  Well, but you know, for some people it works fantastically.
*  I think it's some countries, they actually have term limits.
*  They actually have marriage terms.
*  I don't think that's a real thing.
*  I think it is.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Google it.
*  Some countries have like a term.
*  We did this before, right?
*  Yeah.
*  It's real.
*  Some countries have like, you could get married for like seven years.
*  Oh, I see.
*  And then you have to re-up.
*  Yeah.
*  And you can decide at the end of it.
*  You're like, look, I think we're good.
*  Let's get out of here.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, but that's putting a level of logic into it.
*  That's probably not going to really obtain when the moment comes because by that time
*  you're so codependent.
*  Girls are not going to tolerate that.
*  They're going to let me ask you this.
*  How long have you been with Phil?
*  And he wants a fucking term limit.
*  Right.
*  My God, you guys are going to be together forever.
*  What are you doing to get the fucking term limit?
*  Cause if you stuck with Dave, I bet Dave wouldn't ask for it.
*  Dave's not like that.
*  Like Dave might be a little boring.
*  Maybe he's not as funny, but he's a fucking solid guy.
*  And you would assign the contract.
*  You'd be fine girl.
*  It's really fine.
*  It's like when agents are competing to sign you and they're like, you didn't read for
*  that?
*  Oh, I could have gotten in on that.
*  As soon as there's a financial incentive with anything, things get squirrely.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  Yeah.
*  But it also, you know, I remember you, it's funny you mentioned Tom Arnold.
*  I had him on the very first episode of Politically Incorrect.
*  I think with Roseanne and they were talking about marriage and he said, the
*  great thing about marriage is when you have a big fight and somebody says, I'm
*  leaving, you can go, you can't, we're married.
*  And I got what he was saying.
*  Some people like that, that you have this, this self-imposed barrier that makes it
*  more difficult.
*  It's like a waiting period with guns, you know, or when they make you look at the
*  sonogram, when you want an abortion in some states, look at your fucking baby on
*  the computer screen there and tell them, come back tomorrow and tell me you want to
*  kill that kid.
*  You know, you have a waiting period, you have to cool off.
*  You can't just leave.
*  Whereas if you're not married, you can.
*  Unless you live together, that's more complicated or kids are more complicated.
*  But yeah.
*  And, uh,
*  the other one we got on the board is Kevin Federline.
*  We got him too.
*  What do you mean?
*  Oh, right.
*  Britney's baby daddy.
*  Yeah.
*  He's, uh, he's driving a Ferrari right now.
*  Absolutely.
*  Absolutely.
*  He did.
*  Yeah.
*  Plus he got the fuck Britney Spears, which is a double fist pump.
*  Is that a good thing?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I'm a great, he hasn't said one thing the whole time.
*  You've been here for 16 hours.
*  She has not said one word.
*  And that was the one thing that made a sound come out of Jamie.
*  She's got two things that men men enjoy.
*  She's hot and she's crazy.
*  She's probably fantastic in bed.
*  Is Britney.
*  But still hot.
*  There was a photo of her recently on Instagram.
*  She still looks hot as fuck.
*  I thought she was in a bikini.
*  I think she fell apart.
*  Okay.
*  She might be.
*  I've never seen her in real life.
*  You don't know until you see him.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  I mean, I, I didn't, yeah, I guess I haven't.
*  That's her right now.
*  I haven't.
*  That's her right now.
*  Yep.
*  Well, that's a lot of makeup, no filter.
*  That's a lot of that picture right there.
*  That's a lot of that one looks crazy.
*  Well, she got some crazy videos recently.
*  I do not find.
*  Oh, she's crazy as fuck, man.
*  That, that one right there that we're saying is so great.
*  Upper left.
*  No, no, the right.
*  The one in the middle.
*  I do not.
*  Oh, listen, if it's two o'clock in the morning and you're both drunk, that's what you want.
*  Well, I'm never drunk anymore.
*  And now I go to bed at midnight, which is quite a.
*  She's talking to you.
*  Don't bill wake up.
*  It's Britney.
*  I'm here to fuck.
*  And my dad's here with me because he has to be wherever I go.
*  I see that controversy.
*  Yes.
*  Well, she's like 36 years old now too.
*  Do you think she's tell us to do that?
*  Well, she does that.
*  There's a whole free Britney movement from people who have nothing better to do with
*  their time.
*  And there's no more issues of all the issues in the country that you could adopt as something
*  to take to care about.
*  But people are saying, because yes, she still is under that order that her father has to
*  run her life because remember when she went.
*  Yeah, she went crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I think she's probably always crazy.
*  She just expressed it in a way that made people concerned.
*  And also, I think she's a sweet Southern girl who show business will make you crazy.
*  For sure.
*  I mean, they said the paparazzi chased her like they chased Lady Diana.
*  She couldn't leave her house.
*  Yeah.
*  And yeah, that level of fame is almost unmanageable for anybody.
*  It is.
*  We saw Elvis go through or Michael Jackson go through or any like, right.
*  Do they get you get to that super pop star level?
*  Like, no one can handle it.
*  No.
*  And it's it.
*  Yes, there is a point where it's fame, I think we know is terrific.
*  Mostly unless it gets to that point.
*  Right.
*  I mean, when it's the people trying to help you, when your other people are just looking
*  at like, you know, salespeople and people at airline counters and people who just look
*  at you like, what the fuck do you want?
*  Oh, I don't know.
*  I just for you to do your job.
*  But if they recognize you, then suddenly you get a smile.
*  I always say being famous is like living in a small southern town, you know, in the 50s.
*  Hello.
*  How are you doing?
*  It's so good to see you.
*  You know, they're just friendly in a way that they aren't anymore in big cities.
*  Well, you know where they're still friendly like that?
*  Dallas, Texas.
*  Oh, yes, the South Texas is crazy.
*  South is all the South is still a friendlier place.
*  I love playing the South.
*  Yeah, I'm always in the South.
*  I never considered Texas the South.
*  It's kind of its own thing.
*  It's sort of the South.
*  It is.
*  It's the West as much as it is the South.
*  It's everything.
*  It's a world.
*  Because we're the South.
*  What?
*  We're the South.
*  If you look at the South of the country.
*  Well, we're the West.
*  Southern California.
*  We're the West, but we're also the South.
*  Texas is a weird thing.
*  But we know what we mean when we talk about the South.
*  We're talking about the Southeast.
*  The old Dixie.
*  Yes.
*  And, but Texas is so big.
*  Austin, to me, is not Texan enough.
*  I might as well be in New York.
*  You know?
*  It's more like San Francisco, like a slice of San Francisco.
*  It's too liberal.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes, I do.
*  I want the.
*  You want real barbecue.
*  Yes, I like, well, not barbecue, but I like that Texas flavor.
*  Houston, I love.
*  I always had a better, went back when I used to go out after a show.
*  Always had a better time in the South than the North.
*  Much rather party in Houston than, I don't know, Boston, which is a beautiful city.
*  And I love it.
*  And I love performing there, but I never found the party, but you can't miss it in Houston.
*  Yeah.
*  You know?
*  They're a little more, more jovial.
*  Yeah.
*  Jovial.
*  It's interesting how we think of the South too.
*  Like Arizona is not the South, but it's fucking for sure the South.
*  I mean, it's bordering Mexico.
*  Yes.
*  Well, Arizona.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, they're, they're, they're bringing up the rear a little bit.
*  That's a strange spot.
*  On certain civilization wise.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, there, there's some very concerned.
*  I mean, it's the conservative bastion.
*  I mean, this is Barry Goldwater country and.
*  Yeah.
*  Arizona is a sheriff.
*  Joe Arpaio.
*  You know, I mean, there's some real, real cavemen in Arizona, but I love Arizona.
*  It's an open carry state.
*  Yeah.
*  But when you stick to cities, which we do, you know, we're not playing theaters in the
*  sticks, it doesn't matter what state you're in, you're always going to be and get a liberal
*  audience.
*  Look at the election map every year.
*  There's a lot of red, but any place there's a city, it's a blue dot, especially if
*  they have a college town.
*  I played Birmingham, Alabama.
*  It looks like any place else, at least the crowd coming to my show.
*  I once was, I think it was Birmingham.
*  It was somewhere in Alabama.
*  Must've been either Birmingham or mobile.
*  And, um, there was a bass fishing contest or.
*  Award show tournament, something going on.
*  Like at the same time as my show or maybe my show was starting and it was letting out,
*  but there was this, I was driving up to the theaters, long crowd of people coming to my
*  show who looked like dressed like anywhere else.
*  Normal.
*  And then on the other side of the street, going the other way, a bunch of people in
*  flannel shirts and trucker hats.
*  And it couldn't have been a more obvious example of two Americas, but within the city
*  of Birmingham, Alabama, but it's still a city.
*  And, you know, we see that electorally, the divide Trump does super well among people
*  who never left the town they were born in rural people, people out in the sticks.
*  Um, and does terrible in the cities and now much more increasingly in the suburbs,
*  the suburbs are the swing vote, the suburbs.
*  Last time in 2016, there was a lot of people in the suburbs who don't follow politics
*  that closely and they just said, boy, things suck in America.
*  Let's let the dog drive for a while.
*  Let's see what happens.
*  Let's see what happens.
*  And they didn't, you know, they want to, he's a businessman.
*  He must know how to run the economy and all this stuff.
*  We'll try something new.
*  Those people, I think, first of all, a lot of them have peeled away already.
*  Those are the gettable voters.
*  Those are the people, if the Democrats want to win, I think that they have to
*  target and they already have, but that's why it's so risky to run someone far left.
*  I think if you run Amy Klobuchar, you're going to run a lot of people.
*  I think if you run Amy Klobuchar, as much as people say, Oh, she's, you
*  know, dull and she's this and she's that and no one's excited.
*  Yeah.
*  But again, binary at the end of the day, when there's only two choices, Trump or
*  her, I think it would be hard for her to get the nomination, I think as far as
*  like winning the election, I think she would do it fairly easily.
*  Do you think that Bernie's two left?
*  Do these two left for a lot of the country?
*  Yes.
*  Do you think that's real?
*  The media asked the wrong question.
*  Yeah.
*  The media asks, and that those are debate tonight, the media asks the wrong
*  question, which is what would you do?
*  This is a question that only makes sense if you're running for king.
*  The question should not be, what would you do?
*  The question is, what can you get through?
*  What can you propose that Mitch McConnell will not either block or you can override
*  with votes because that's a very different discussion, what Bernie Sanders wants to
*  do, we shouldn't even be talking about because it's not going to happen.
*  The free education, paying back student loan debt.
*  Medicare for all.
*  Medicare for all.
*  You know, all these, as long as the, unless the Republicans self-deport, even if the
*  Democrat wins the election, there's still going to be half the country that's
*  Republican and half the Congress is going to be Republican.
*  And there's just a lot of Democrats are not for this stuff.
*  You know, when the Democrats took over the house in 2018, it was moderate
*  Democrats who won their elections.
*  It wasn't the far left.
*  So, so you get four years of spinning your wheel in the mud.
*  You get, hoping to get some traction.
*  Yeah.
*  If he gets in.
*  Again, it's what can get through Congress?
*  What can you get a consensus on?
*  What, what can you make possible?
*  Obama, when he did healthcare said, yes, if we were starting from scratch, it would
*  make sense to go for a single payer system, but we're not starting from
*  scratch, we're starting from a system where most people already have health
*  insurance through their employer.
*  It's a crazy story, how that happened.
*  It was world war II and they couldn't raise wages because that was the law.
*  So they had to find a way to give employers something else.
*  So they gave them health insurance, but that's what we have now.
*  And a lot of people like it or say they like it.
*  I don't think a lot of people like arguing with their insurance company, but
*  they're afraid of something worse.
*  And I don't blame them.
*  You know, if you're going to tell me the government and I'm a Democrat, but if
*  you're going to tell me the government is going to smoothly handle taking over
*  something that large, I am going to be a little skeptical.
*  Well, it should be, they don't smoothly handle anything.
*  There's no evidence they smoothly handle anything other than maybe delivering
*  the news or delivering the mail.
*  Look again, as an old school progressive, when you go down the list of things that
*  the progressives have accomplished, especially in my lifetime, I cheer them
*  all social security.
*  Well, that wasn't my lifetime, but they improved it in my lifetime.
*  Medicare, Medicaid.
*  These are great programs.
*  I mean, before social security, the senior poverty rate was like in the 28%
*  or something, and then it went down below 10.
*  It was a success.
*  But when you look at what the government really, what their big successes have
*  amounted to, it's passing out money that very often they don't have.
*  That's what they're really good at running a giant healthcare system,
*  especially when the politicians who are proposing these systems will not, A,
*  talk enough about, we've got to cap the gouging.
*  You can't pass out all this money with, if you're, if you're going to allow people,
*  hospitals, pharmaceutical companies to charge anything they want when the price
*  of an EpiPen can go up from $12 to 1200 overnight, that just can't happen.
*  And also they don't ask the people to lift a finger to take care of their own health.
*  Nobody's healthcare system is going to work unless you involve, people have
*  some skin in the game.
*  You can't like not tell the people, look, you can't keep eating as much as you
*  want and as shitty a food as you want and expect us to cover the bill.
*  You just can't.
*  That is not something that anybody wants to hear though.
*  Oh, I know because I did that editorial.
*  I know. I remember that people got upset.
*  Well, people, here's the story.
*  People did not.
*  People loved it until James Corden said something.
*  Oh, that's right.
*  He had that whole, first of all, he did that and in doing that made fat jokes,
*  which was, which I did not, by the way.
*  Yeah.
*  Mine, mine was cheap on morbid people, morbidly obese people.
*  First of all, he missed a great opportunity to literally save lives.
*  If he had taken the opposite approach, he took the easy way out.
*  Of course you can always get applause for saying, oh, let's, let's boo the
*  mean man who's told the truth.
*  That's not brave.
*  Um, first of all, my point was a, that you can't solve healthcare unless you
*  ask the people to participate in that.
*  That was one.
*  And also that we've gone to this place where we're proud of it.
*  We're proud of being unhealthy.
*  Weight watchers had to take the name weight and watchers out of their title.
*  It's WW now.
*  It's like, wait, what?
*  It's see being fat.
*  That isn't bad.
*  What's bad is someone pointing out that fat is bad.
*  But I mean, I read the statistic in that editorial, 40,000 people a month, a
*  month die from obesity.
*  That's a crazy number.
*  That is a crazy number.
*  We have to somehow reverse this idea that we have in this country, not just
*  about obesity, but about a lot of things where I'm perfect the way I am.
*  I am just perfect the way I am.
*  And if you say different, you're a very bad person.
*  That's not a good place to be.
*  It's not healthy for anybody.
*  It's you're, you're protecting people's emotions, but shielding them from a
*  possible moment that might make them realize that they are eating themselves to death.
*  Right.
*  I mean, look, I said it also in the piece, beauties in the eye of the beholder.
*  That's fine.
*  Whatever you think is beautiful.
*  That's your deal.
*  But health is science.
*  Yeah.
*  That's science.
*  And when we get apoplectic, when there's 50 deaths from shootings or something a
*  month, yeah, it's very bad and we should be serious about that problem.
*  But 50 versus 40,000 every month.
*  And that's just what they're counting from the big ones, cancer, diabetes,
*  and heart disease.
*  There's literally nothing about your health that is improved by being overweight.
*  So, you know, I said we shouldn't taunt people, but you know, compare it to
*  anything else.
*  I also owned up to the fact that I used to drink too much and I smoked, but I
*  didn't defend it when someone said, you know, you went kind of hard last night
*  with the drinking.
*  I didn't say, how dare you drunk shame me.
*  Well, the weird thing about Gordon, I did.
*  Weird thing about Gordon too is he's not that fat.
*  Like he could fix that in a couple of years.
*  That's not that hard.
*  No, he took it up.
*  It was a, it was opportunistic.
*  Yes.
*  I felt like that too.
*  I'm saying he could have, he literally lost an opportunity to save lives because
*  as someone who does struggle with weight, he could have taken the opposite approach
*  and said, you know, he, Bill makes a really good point and we should, we should
*  look at how we are dealing with this.
*  I noticed Jillian Michaels, the fitness expert.
*  Still got to go.
*  For Lizzo.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know, if you want to be whatever weight you want to be, that's fine, but
*  it's wrong to shame a fitness expert for saying this isn't healthy.
*  Well, it gets even crazy.
*  It's not going to be that amazing when she gets diabetes.
*  Yeah.
*  And people want not diabetes has nothing to do with weight.
*  Uh, diabetes has everything to do with it.
*  For sure.
*  Also they, they, they lie.
*  They say things like, well, it's the fat gene.
*  It's the, it's the, it's the, it's the, it's the, it's the, it's the, it's the
*  there, you know, there's not, it's not that.
*  Or here's another one.
*  And look, this is valid.
*  It's valid that in this country, it is a lot harder to eat right.
*  If you're poor.
*  Yes.
*  And we should totally address that.
*  Yes.
*  Doubt if it's on any candidates top 10 list, but the way the food situation and
*  subsidies are done in this country is horrible, but given that let's not just
*  throw up our hands and say, we're the can't do country.
*  And because it's harder, let's not even try.
*  Yes, it is harder to eat right on a budget, but I'll tell you something,
*  something you never need to have with your food soda, which is a large part of
*  it, okay, and you'll save money.
*  You don't have to have soda.
*  You don't have to have a Snickers bar.
*  A banana is 19 cents.
*  So it's not impossible.
*  Adele got shit recently because she got, yes, because she got healthy.
*  That's was also a part of my thing was fit shaming, not fat shaming.
*  People go eat something, eat something.
*  I'm fine.
*  What?
*  So you can feel better about your weight problem.
*  I should eat and get fat too.
*  Well, when heavy people have a fan or have someone that they're a fan of, that's
*  also heavy, like James Corden, like, so he's heavy, he's got people in the
*  audience that love him and they love him standing up for other heavy people.
*  Yeah, we're fine.
*  We're fine.
*  He's one of us.
*  We're fine.
*  I think they felt like that with Adele.
*  That Adele was this fantastic singer, super talented, extremely popular and
*  overweight, like, yeah, it's fine.
*  It's fine.
*  I'm like Adele.
*  Everyone's fine.
*  It wasn't.
*  Then she loses weight.
*  Like you feel like she's betraying you because one of the reasons why I liked
*  you is because you're fat.
*  Now you're not fat anymore.
*  It wasn't that long ago that we were applauding people when they lost weight.
*  Yeah.
*  I remember when, remember when Oprah came out that time, was she was, oh, this was
*  like in the eighties, I think, but she had lost a whole bunch of, well, there's
*  a picture, it's a very famous picture.
*  I think she's, she's like in jeans and she's got a like really thin waist and,
*  you know, she was raising her hands and triumph and everyone was applauding.
*  I guess that's bad now because again, you have to be perfect the way you are.
*  And if you criticize that, then you're a bad person.
*  I, my take on this is just that there's too many voices that you hear because of
*  social media, you hear so many nonsense voices and they stand out just like
*  everybody else's voice.
*  There's so many people just screaming into the void because there's so many
*  social media accounts, so many people that are tweeting about things and
*  Facebooking about things.
*  And, and it gets people confused is that this is like a rational perspective.
*  And again, with these echo chambers, they're all just hop on board and support
*  James Corden or support, you know, Adele needs to fatten back up and you'll,
*  you'll get thousands of likes.
*  Everybody will go crazy.
*  That's the key word.
*  Yeah.
*  That's just what I didn't understand until about a year ago that so many people
*  are saying things on social media, not because they really believe it to get the
*  likes.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's really scary.
*  That's weird.
*  We had a billboard once when we were coming back on the air in January, just
*  like now, about four or five years ago.
*  And the tagline was he's not in it for the likes.
*  And it's my favorite piece of promotion that anyone has ever done for me.
*  That's great.
*  He's not in it for the likes.
*  Yeah.
*  Advertising that as this is why you watch this show.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, but obviously that's not the way a lot of people feel.
*  They are in it for the likes and they will take a position that they don't believe
*  in because they know it'll get likes.
*  And I've heard this from people I actually respect and I'm like, wow, you
*  have an addiction.
*  That is an addiction.
*  Addiction to likes.
*  Addiction.
*  Yeah.
*  There is absolutely that.
*  And they calculate their posts based on the kind of response they think it's
*  going to get.
*  It's not like a free expression.
*  It's not like they're, they're making a post saying, how do I feel about this
*  thing?
*  Okay.
*  This is a, they're writing it down going, how are people going to react to this?
*  How am I going to get people to really think that I'm awesome?
*  How am I going to get people to really think I'm progressive, really think I'm
*  an open-minded person.
*  Hmm.
*  Hmm.
*  The male feminist perspective.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  I was just talking to Jimmy, my friend, Jimmy door about that, about male
*  feminists, about that.
*  That's like a wholly false perspective and you never see it in gay guys.
*  Like there are no male feminist gay guys, cause they're not trying to fuck the
*  women.
*  So it's like the, it's not a position they would take.
*  Right.
*  It's, it's, they'll, they'll support you.
*  They'll be your friend.
*  Right.
*  This whole idea.
*  I'm, I'm an ally.
*  I mean, like you're trying to fuck man.
*  It's so clear.
*  It's such an obvious perspective.
*  You know, it's just such a weird sneaky thing.
*  Yeah.
*  But that's a, that's a, it's a version of the same thing people are doing for
*  likes on social media.
*  It's a calculated expression in order to get, uh, you know, what, what the kind
*  of response you're hoping.
*  You know, it's greasy.
*  Right.
*  It's greasy.
*  It's not the word I would have thought of, but perfect.
*  Whenever I read male feminist posts, I get angry.
*  I just get, I just, not that I don't want equality for women.
*  I just, I, you're a greasy man.
*  I know what you're doing.
*  Do you read your Twitter?
*  No.
*  Me neither.
*  Never.
*  Because why would I, exactly.
*  And, and what I read about people very often who've killed themselves.
*  Oh yeah.
*  You know, responses that yet this is a big thing.
*  How about this guy losing his fucking job for saying retard?
*  Couldn't you just.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Could you just stop?
*  Well, he got a job with the saints.
*  Did he?
*  Oh, that's fine.
*  Like he was a great football player.
*  Which is a better team.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, I mean, I asked some people who I know, like Barry Weiss, who's like brilliant person.
*  And she's like, oh, my, it's like so depressing.
*  My Twitter, it's like, don't read it.
*  Oh yeah.
*  She came out here.
*  That generation cannot stop reading even when it's going to kill them.
*  I don't understand that.
*  Well, it's, it's very impulsive, right?
*  You see your name and you see someone, what did they say?
*  Oh, Barry, you're brilliant.
*  Oh, thank you.
*  And then you go a little further.
*  You fucking don't.
*  Died you.
*  Oh, Jesus Christ.
*  And then there's a bunch of them liking that response and then a bunch of people piling on.
*  And you gotta realize this.
*  So first of all, they don't even know you're a real human.
*  A lot of people have never met anyone famous.
*  They have no, they, they are looking at, and a lot of them are 15.
*  Like when I, I always say that if I had a Twitter account when I was 15, I would've
*  said horrible shit to famous people.
*  Right.
*  Just to get a rise.
*  Right.
*  Just to get a reaction, see if I can get them to react.
*  It's not even things that they necessarily mean.
*  They don't know you, but unless they meet you, they don't even really know you.
*  But that people take it to heart so much that they killed themselves.
*  You know what?
*  Uh, a few of these K-pop stars have killed themselves.
*  Really?
*  Look that up from social media.
*  Yes.
*  I think so.
*  I think that's the main reason.
*  And they're, and these are, you know, pop stars.
*  Yeah.
*  I can't imagine.
*  Top of the world.
*  Bobby Sherman, you know, 1968 reading his fan mail.
*  This one hates me too.
*  Elvis had a Twitter account.
*  Hey man, fuck you give a shit.
*  Priscilla's 14.
*  We like each other, man.
*  Yeah.
*  Come on.
*  What the fuck?
*  I ain't a pervert.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, maybe he could have used social media back then.
*  That's it.
*  Right.
*  That's the balance.
*  Like you don't want Jerry Lee Lewis marrying his cousin and drowning his wives.
*  And you also don't want Elvis fucking 14 year olds.
*  Maybe it'd be better.
*  I, yeah.
*  Maybe a little bit.
*  I often wonder what my life would have been like as a teenager with this stuff,
*  because maybe it would have made me kill myself, but I was painfully shy.
*  Couldn't really talk to a girl.
*  If I had been able to text them, I think I would have done exactly.
*  I think I could have done really well with that.
*  I would have had a lot of dick pictures floating around a hundred percent.
*  I would have sent it to everybody.
*  When you're fucking dumb and young, you have no idea that's going to last forever.
*  I thought that was a humble brag about his dick.
*  No, no, it's a regular dick, but it was just any old dick.
*  I'd send people other people's dicks, but I would just think that the whole idea.
*  Yeah, because young boys love dick picking.
*  They draw it.
*  Yeah, they're crazy.
*  Remember that scene in, what was the fucking movie?
*  Superbad.
*  That was one of my favorite scenes in a movie ever where he's just drawing
*  dicks in class all day.
*  It's fucking hilarious.
*  Because it's so true.
*  That's so true.
*  Yeah.
*  We got real lucky that we are not held up to the standards that kids are today
*  because everything they do today that they put online, they're going to put a
*  lot of things online, it's permanent forever.
*  I couldn't imagine something that I said when I was 14 being permanent.
*  And that points me back to this thing about this football player and things
*  that people write on Twitter.
*  It's something that Louis CK said to me recently, we were talking about this.
*  He said, people look at stuff when it's written down, like it's different,
*  but it's just talk.
*  It's talk, but it's written.
*  Like people say, oh, she's a fucking bitch.
*  I'm tired of her shit.
*  And then you see her, you're like, oh, I'm sorry.
*  Like, but that's talk, right?
*  But when you see it written, it's like, oh my God, did you see what he put on Twitter?
*  Do you see what he wrote?
*  Like you're talking to the whole world now and you got to realize this is a
*  different thing and then people get a screenshot of it.
*  You can never take it back.
*  You said it.
*  We're going to keep it forever.
*  We're going to archive it.
*  Look, he said it.
*  He said, she's a fucking bitch.
*  And you can't, there's no just talk anymore, but we're wired for just talk.
*  People are wired for gossip and, and nonsense talk, especially when you're drinking.
*  But if you're drinking and then you get on Twitter, oh, you could, you could say
*  the dumbest shit ever, you could tank your life.
*  And people have.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, Justine Sacco, that famous case.
*  That was one of the first ones, the one who was on, as soon as she got off the flight.
*  Her life was upside down.
*  Right.
*  She gets on a plane.
*  I mean, it's almost comical, except for her.
*  It's comical.
*  You know, she gets on a plane and tweets it.
*  She thinks something is funny.
*  And then by the time the plane lands, her life's over.
*  By the way, family guy did a hysterical version of that where Brian, the dog
*  goes into the theater, he tweets something going into a theater and it's semi-racist,
*  but it's, and then by the time he comes out of the movie, his life is destroyed by
*  the Twitter mob is literally a mob outside his house.
*  We're not designed for permanence like that.
*  The, to be able to just express yourself loosely.
*  It's like, if you're going to write something in a book and publish that book, and
*  you're going to carefully consider every word, and then you put that book out and
*  you go, okay, we've gone over it.
*  We've read it.
*  That's a different thing than fuck this guy.
*  So what do you think should go on with Louis CK?
*  You mentioned him.
*  Um, I know more about it than most people because I've talked to Louis about it,
*  but what happened versus what's being portrayed is what happened.
*  There were, uh, there's a lot of stuff that's just not true.
*  Like he was never blocking anybody's door.
*  And what's, and what's unfair is that he cannot say it.
*  He can, if you, if you engage and defend yourself and correct the record, then you
*  make it worse.
*  Yeah.
*  So you're in this sort of purgatory where if you hear things that are not true, you
*  also cannot say anything about it.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a, that's an unfair place to be.
*  And also like, is everything a hanging offense?
*  My problem with some of the me too stuff.
*  And of course, I think like every right thinking person, it was a great thing that
*  happened that men have been put on notice that you're playing with five fouls.
*  And you just can't get away with a lot of the shit you use.
*  Particularly men in positions of power in the office place.
*  Right.
*  I mean, I think let's, let's, let's also extend it to the fracking industry and
*  McDonald's and every other place in America where probably it's very prevalent.
*  Nobody ever hears about it, but there is just no consistency.
*  Charlie Sheen.
*  Well, I'm not picking on, I like them, but.
*  Well, I'm not picking on, I like them, but he got a Superbowl commercial last year.
*  Well, he did way worse things than Louis CK.
*  Why worse?
*  You couldn't get Louis CK.
*  So people would like Louis CK is in a Superbowl commercial.
*  That is ridiculous.
*  Charlie Sheen.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause Charlie Sheen has no shame.
*  And I know, but he held a knife to his.
*  Did he?
*  Didn't that time in Aspen wasn't that he was with the third wife or something.
*  And I seem to remember, but he's done crazy being sued for giving people AIDS.
*  And I mean, there's just this litany of things that are way worse than whacking
*  off in front of people, which is not cool either.
*  Of course it's, but Louis did apologize and own up to it.
*  And I just think the there, where is the consistency?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, and also where is the, is it a, is it all, is everything a life sentence?
*  Louis is a horrible person forever.
*  Or is there some point where we used to go?
*  Yes.
*  A person pays his debt to society in some way.
*  Uh, and then, you know, I, you know, you're allowed back.
*  I feel, I just feel bad for him.
*  I mean, I feel like he did weird shit that he shouldn't have done for sure.
*  And I think he knows that I know he knows that, but what is the proper,
*  uh, punishment and is, and who decides it?
*  Well, he's definitely working again.
*  So all the people that are complaining and bitching about overseas.
*  No, he's working here.
*  No, he's doing a lot of theaters.
*  He's doing, he's touring again.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  When you selling his tickets to his fans.
*  Yeah.
*  Sure.
*  But he certainly can't do everything he wants to do.
*  Right.
*  And he can, he can still tour.
*  But even if he wants to do a special boy, who's going to take them up on that?
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, who's going to jump, jump the line.
*  And maybe, maybe the proper punishment is another five years before you can have a
*  special, but that's a long time.
*  Well, I'm just saying, I'm just pulling it out of my ass.
*  I'm just saying what we need some sort of, it's been more than two years, some
*  sort of me to court that will end down a fair and just, just to find judge.
*  Rose McGowan presiding.
*  Yeah.
*  How would you, how do you decide when, you know, a person has been punished enough
*  and what, and what is the crime?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, he's, he's got some hilarious bits about it.
*  He goes, so the problem was, uh, I like jerking off and I don't like being alone.
*  Right.
*  And I wanted to, the rest of the material he does about it, but you know, he asked,
*  he asked, can I jerk off in front of you?
*  When they said, yes, he did it.
*  It's not a good thing.
*  Nothing's good about any of it.
*  But, and he knows it and no, I'm not defending him.
*  But people are portraying it as far worse than like, he went up at skank
*  fest in New York and people went crazy and cheered and, uh, I reposted the video
*  of it and someone posted on Twitter.
*  One of the rare times I look, fuck you, Joe Rogan.
*  He assaulted women.
*  Yeah.
*  No, no, he didn't know, but he didn't, you're going to, you can't
*  change what assault means.
*  Right.
*  He asked if he could jerk off in front of people and then he did.
*  There's some question as to whether or not he jerked off on the phone with somebody.
*  I don't think that's assault either.
*  It's kind of creepy.
*  Not even kind of it's, I'm sure he would say it's creepy, but we're not talking
*  about someone assaulted people.
*  Like you, you can't just change the definitions of the word because it makes
*  you feel better about hating someone.
*  Now I also read, but I don't know if it's true.
*  If his management, I think, um, threatened women who were going to talk about this
*  or prevented someone's career from moving because of this, if that happened,
*  that to me is almost worse.
*  Yes.
*  That's really bad stuff.
*  Agreed.
*  I don't know if that's true and he's not allowed to talk to straighten that out.
*  Well, it's not that he's not allowed to talk.
*  Well, it would be, he's considered talking about it a few times.
*  And I think he just, he decides at the end of the day, it's just better
*  to just keep pushing ahead.
*  Right.
*  And his new hour, apparently I'm not advertising for it, but from everybody
*  that I heard it's fucking amazing.
*  Cause all the pain, all the craziness, he apparently has a talk about new
*  material, talking about something to talk about.
*  Do you have to get out of here?
*  Cause they said you got two hours.
*  I do.
*  Cause it's like a work night for me.
*  All right.
*  Well, wrap this bad boy up.
*  Tell people when is it?
*  Uh, when's the new season air?
*  Uh, Friday, this Friday.
*  Yeah.
*  The 17th of January.
*  Um, same bat time, same bat channel, HBO at, uh, 10 Eastern.
*  And I guess you can figure out the other time zones from that.
*  And, uh, we're going to go back at it again.
*  Plenty to talk about.
*  Plenty to talk about always.
*  See.
*  Congratulations by the way, on making this such a big stop and such an iconic place.
*  You did good.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  I don't know what the fuck happened.
*  Just stumbled into it.
*  Will you do my show?
*  Sure.
*  Okay.
*  I asked you before and you were very squirrely about it.
*  People, they're all talking over each other for soundbites.
*  You know, I heard you say that once when you were laughing at some guy doing a
*  terrible impression of me and, and it's a very,
*  Kyle Kalinsky.
*  He does a great impression of you.
*  I didn't know who he was.
*  Have you ever seen the face off the face swap version that he does of you on Instagram?
*  No, I don't know.
*  Find that before we leave.
*  What's that?
*  Kyle, that's a Klinsky.
*  Sorry.
*  Sorry, Kyle.
*  We don't have to look at this.
*  I'm leaving.
*  It's amazing.
*  To you, it was amazing.
*  It wasn't.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't, I don't, man, people have done me and I can laugh at it.
*  It's not that it was your face.
*  He's got your face and he's doing an impression of you.
*  You've never seen this.
*  I saw what, anyway, the point.
*  Yeah, it doesn't matter.
*  The point was, what was the point?
*  Uh, point was there's not too many people talking over each other on your show.
*  Correct.
*  It feels like it is to me.
*  It's very difficult to have a conversation when there's so many different people talking.
*  That's such a fundamental criticism of my show.
*  It's not your show.
*  It's just that format.
*  That's the size.
*  But that's, that was, I think you're thinking of politically incorrect was that way.
*  I'm thinking of your show right now.
*  Well, I'm there every week.
*  Okay.
*  And I monitor it pretty closely.
*  Of course, when you have a panel, which we do, there can be those moments, but we
*  don't book that kind of person and that kind of show.
*  It's not the old, let's get them fighting thing.
*  We don't want that.
*  And honestly, the number of times when people have been shouting over each other
*  and you can't hear them is very little.
*  It's not even that they're shouting over each other.
*  It's that if you have a point and you want to talk about something, you got to let it
*  roll around the side of your head.
*  Yeah.
*  But you would be the mid show guest to my left and it would be a one-on-one.
*  You know, I do a one-on-one twice in the show.
*  Have you seen the show?
*  Yes.
*  Okay.
*  In the middle of the show, I bring out more of a celebrity usually to my left.
*  I watched the one where Sam Harris started going at it with Ben Affleck because of that.
*  Sam was your one-on-one.
*  That's right.
*  Okay.
*  Well, that's, you know, you picked the one example where somebody, that's what you
*  were talking about.
*  I think he's seen one show.
*  No, I've seen several.
*  I saw the one with Milo.
*  I've seen Jordan Peterson.
*  I've seen many, many shows.
*  We've done over 500.
*  I think that's good.
*  I just think, I'm glad we got, glad we, I only, I don't demand that anyone be a
*  fan.
*  I just like honesty.
*  One of my favorite ones was when Christopher Hitchens went after
*  most deaf.
*  Well, he's been dead for like 10 years.
*  So once again, we're establishing your knowledge of this show is very limited.
*  So I watched a bunch of episodes.
*  I hope you don't watch any.
*  I don't need you.
*  But I have.
*  I have lots of fans.
*  I don't need one more.
*  What I'm saying is I like you to do it because I think you'd be good and I like
*  listening to you and you'd be to my left one-on-one.
*  There would be nobody shouting over you cause they wouldn't be involved.
*  Okay.
*  So you wouldn't have that problem.
*  So will you do it?
*  Yes.
*  Great.
*  All right.
*  And then we'll work on it.
*  Shit.
*  Then we'll work on Hawaii.
*  All right.
*  All right.
*  Bill Maher, ladies and gentlemen.
*  Thank you.
*  Appreciate you being here, man.
*  Bye everybody.
