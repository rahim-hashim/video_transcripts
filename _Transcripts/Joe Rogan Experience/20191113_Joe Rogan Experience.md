# Joe Rogan Experience #1383 - Malcolm Gladwell
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 13, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Okg2LH6XKzY)
*  Hello Malcolm. Hey Joe. How you doing? I'm doing very well. You sound like you. Good, good. That's
*  always a good sign. It's through headphones. It's very interesting because I've been listening to
*  talking to strangers. I like that you narrate your books. It's very frustrating when someone
*  who's a great speaker does not narrate their books. So thanks for doing that. No, I actually,
*  I kind of enjoy, I used to hate that process with my first one and then I've grown to enjoy it
*  because when you say your book out loud you see it in a different way. Like oh, you get a little
*  bit of a different perspective on it. Well I'm a giant fan of your work man, particularly Outliers.
*  I really love that book. It's very illuminating and sort of peels away the mystery of talent.
*  And so tell me what you're doing. What is this talking to strangers I'm into about,
*  I'm in the second chapter right now. Oh I see. Well that was a book about, I was struck by how
*  many of the kind of high profile cases that we got obsessed with were at their root about the
*  same thing, which is that individuals were two people who didn't know each other well,
*  had an exchange and they got each other wrong. So you know everything from Amanda Knox to Bernie
*  Madoff to Larry Nassar at Michigan State to Jerry Sandusky at Penn State and then to the signature
*  case which the book is organized around which is the Sandra Bland case. Remember the young
*  woman in Texas who gets pulled over by the side of the road. They're all at root fundamentally the
*  same problem which is there's an exchange between and the exchange just goes wrong and the question
*  is why? That's what I began to get really fascinated by is you think at this point in human
*  evolution we would have got this thing about talking to strangers down and we clearly don't
*  and we're being pushed to talk more and more to strangers right in a kind of globalized world and
*  if we're bad at it that doesn't bode well does it? Well I think there's also an issue today with
*  people not learning the necessary skills and how to talk to people because so much communication
*  is done digitally. Yeah. It seems to be a giant issue with young kids. They're more awkward
*  initially talking to people than I think I remember. Yeah, yeah. I think that's probably, you forget
*  how much I mean adolescent adolescents used to be this one long rehearsal in how to be a normal
*  human being in conversation and now the rehearsal it's like the rehearsal got cut in half and you
*  know instead of getting to the point where we play basketball with basketballs we're still just
*  doing wind sprints or something you know. Right, you never get to actually playing a game. You know
*  playing a game I'm butchering the metaphor. I know what you're saying though. The Sandra Bland case,
*  how does that one fit in because that one that girl was pulled over the cop was, she was failure
*  to signal right? Yeah I mean it's a bullshit thing. It's a bullshit thing and she started lighting
*  a cigarette he told her to put the cigarette out and it all escalated from that she said she
*  doesn't have to put the cigarette out and then he says he's gonna light her up he's screaming
*  at her he pulls her out of the car he rests her and then is there controversy about whether or not
*  she committed suicide in jail? There is. I don't get into that. Okay because it seemed that seemed
*  unlikely. That she was killed? Yes it seemed likely that she was killed versus she committed
*  suicide. I didn't think that someone would commit suicide being in jail for three days especially
*  one of the things that you highlighted in the book and you actually played in the audio version of
*  it her little sort of affirmations you know and she was she sounded very positive and upbeat and
*  calling everybody kings and queens and it was in thanking God and being very thankful and being
*  aware of life and humility and just graciousness and gratitude it didn't seem I mean obviously you
*  don't know I mean what kind of dark things can happen to a person when they're incarcerated for
*  three days for a bullshit reason like how maybe that's the straw that broke the camel's back but
*  she did have you know she had a complicated emotional history she had previously I tried
*  to commit suicide and she had she was emerging from a quite a difficult period in her life and
*  went to Texas to start a new leaf and so there is an interpretation like I said I don't really have
*  strong feelings on this particular part of the story but there's an interpretation that says
*  here's a woman who's emerged from a very difficult period in her life goes leaves she was in Illinois
*  she drives half across the country to start over and on the first day that she arrives in Texas to
*  start over she gets pulled over by a cop and by the way she had thousands of dollars in outstanding
*  tickets so she had a history of this bullshit stuff with cops where you know the the same
*  trap that many poor people in this country get into which is they get the police use
*  people as an ATM right they like set them up for untrivial things and when they can't
*  find when they can't pay the fine they get another fine and when you know you how that
*  goes she was part of in that trap so here she is trying to start over after difficult time gets
*  first day she gets to Texas she gets pulled over again and she in her mind it's the same she's like
*  oh my god I tried to start over and I can't you know and then she's in jail and she can't make bail
*  and you know there's a scenario where you can see that she just began to despair don't they take
*  away your shoelaces and do small town Texas yeah are they doing things by the book right I mean I
*  find the whole thing about I went to that town when I was reporting the book and you know the
*  it's kind of hard to be to kill to kill someone and get away from get away with it requires a
*  level of expertise and forethought that struck me was not present in that little town in Texas I mean
*  it's just not I don't they're not like they're not thinking this these are not people playing
*  chess right I think they it's just encountered it with this cop and he's not very good at his job
*  and he gets way over his head and he completely misreads her and he pulls her off to jail probably
*  deeply regrets the whole incident and they're all embarrassed and sitting around and hoping
*  it'll just all go away and meanwhile she's all alone in a prison cell spiraling deeper and deeper
*  into depression I mean it's I think it's almost more tragic um that she commits suicide it's insane
*  that you can keep someone in jail for three days for failure to signal it seems like there should
*  have been an initial review of the circumstances that led to her getting pulled out of the car in
*  the first place and the cop should have been fired immediately they just like you're screaming at her
*  because she lit a cigarette yeah in her own car meanwhile this is fascinating and I feel like
*  I don't know you and I are probably the same age there's this so the cops 29 if you grew up with
*  cigarettes you have a different understanding of the meaning of lighting a cigarette so what's
*  happening in the encounter is he pulls her over what he does is he sees her coming out of this
*  university campus and while she's still on campus property she rolls through a stop sign and then he
*  notices that she's got out of state plates and she's a young black woman and she's driving
*  Hyundai like not a not a Mercedes-Benz and he thinks ha I'm gonna check this out so he she pulls
*  onto the road and he drives up behind her aggressively he speeds up behind her so what does
*  she do well what any of us would do she gets out of the way thinking oh he's he's going to he's going
*  to you know the scene of an accident or something I better get out of his way she pulls over to get
*  out of his way and he goes oh he didn't use your turning signal and he pulls him pulls her over and
*  pulls him behind her now by the way whenever I hear a fire department truck or a police car coming
*  and I pull over to get out of the way I do not use my turning signal right you just get out of the
*  way it's reflective right so her immediate thought is what he does is is like oh this is
*  bullshit and he tricked me and he knows what he's doing that's exactly what he wanted he wanted to
*  get her in a situation because it's all a pretext he just wants he thinks oh maybe there's something
*  weird with her so then he we have this all on tape of course because this is in this is one of
*  those incidents that was captured entirely on the dashcam the officer's dashcam he goes up to the
*  window and he says he looks at her and he realizes she's agitated why because she's pissed off and
*  he goes mam is there something wrong and she's like well you know I want to know why I'm pulled
*  over and then he goes back to his car and he comes back to her and he later says in a deposition
*  that when he goes back to his to his vehicle to check on her license and registration he begins
*  to develop suspicions that she's up to no good she's got drugs or guns and so she comes back and
*  they commence to have this increasingly heated conversation and she lights the cigarette because
*  she's trying to calm herself down and this is my point you and I who grew up in an era where people
*  smoked all the time know that one of the principal functions of lighting a cigarette was to calm your
*  nerves and in her mind I think in her mind she's trying to signal to the cop let's de-escalate this
*  and I'm one of the ways I'm going to show you that I want to de-escalate this is I'm going to take a
*  moment and light a cigarette and just take it down a notch and let's have a real conversation
*  he doesn't understand the meaning of that gesture and he thinks oh she he thinks several things he
*  thinks one she's messing with me she's defying my authority by lighting a cigarette she's going to
*  blow smoke in my face or something you know nefarious or she's going to like take the lighted
*  cigarette and put it out of my he has all these kind of weird crazy fantasies this is what he said
*  in the deposition oh yeah he so even on the level I try and identify in the book all of the different
*  ways and this when I come back to the case at the end of the book I go through this in more detail
*  all the different ways in which he completely misunderstands her and one of them is he doesn't
*  understand the meaning of lighting a cigarette in a moment of tension and that's you know still more
*  evidence why you need if you're a cop or anyone dealing with a stranger you need to slow down and
*  not jump to any conclusions because there's so much you can miss what it seemed to me when I
*  listened to it initially and then I listened to it again in your audiobook there's a thing that
*  happens with police officers and I've never been a police officer but I was a security guard for a
*  brief period of time and I recognized it in myself and I recognized it in a lot of people that I work
*  with is that you start treating the other people like the other like it's us and them it was us
*  I worked at a great great woods it's a performance center in Mansfield Massachusetts like this so
*  and we would catch a lot of people smuggling booze in things like that and there was an attitude
*  that you got and I was only there for one summer but there's an attitude of they were they were
*  the bad people and you were the good guys it was us and them and we stuck together and they weren't
*  us and cops get that a hundred times worse because there's guns involved and they can get
*  shot at we've all seen videos of cops pulling people over and he says can I see your hands
*  please and the guy pulls out a gun and shoots at them we've all seen those videos those are
*  this is all always in the back of the mind of cops yeah and I think that was just a guy who as you
*  said 29 years old is a young guy he's not that bright not good at communication and he is this
*  attitude that he's a cop and that you have to listen to the cops because he's them and you're
*  you yeah and that that's like when he's telling her to put the cigarette out and she's saying I
*  don't have to do that and he's saying get out of your vehicle and she's saying I don't have to do
*  that and then he's screaming at her I mean that's that's all right there I mean that's what it seems
*  like to me he wants compliance he wants her to listen he does yeah he does want he gets it's funny
*  the what's remarkable about that tape which I must have seen 50 times and which has been viewed on
*  YouTube you know even a couple million times is how quickly it escalates yeah the whole thing is
*  it's insanely short yeah you you would think if I was telling you the story of this you would think
*  oh this unfolds over 10 minutes and it doesn't it unfolds over a minute and a half and that
*  what I remember years ago I wrote my second book blink and I have in that book a chapter about a
*  very famous infamous police shooting in New York case of Amadou Diallo I remember that remember
*  that one where he was shot like 40 times by cops yeah and one of the big things I was interested in
*  uh talking about in that case was how long does it take how long did it take for that whole
*  terrible sequence to go down so from the moment the police develop it uh suspicions about Amadou
*  Diallo to the moment that Amadou Diallo is lying dead on his front porch how long how much time
*  elapsed and the answer is like two seconds it's boom boom boom it's like and I had a conversation
*  with um actually here in the valley with uh uh Gavin De Becker um has he ever been on your show
*  no oh fascinating guy we were security expert security expert incredibly interesting guy
*  he's friends with Sam Harris I know that he is yeah yeah um and he was talking about this question
*  of time that when you're a security guard guarding someone you know famous a lot of what you're
*  trying to do is to inject time into the scenario instead of you don't want something to unfold in
*  a second and a half where you have almost no time to react properly and what you want to do is to
*  want it to unfold in five seconds if you're gonna add oh I'm making this up I can't remember his
*  exact term but basically what your job is is to add seconds into the the encounter so that you have
*  a chance to intelligently respond to what's going on and so he was hit this great riff about um
*  how good Israeli uh secret uh secret service guys are and one of the things they do is they're
*  they're uh they're either not armed or they don't they're trained not to go for their weapons in
*  these situations because his point is so say you're guarding the president you're a body man for the
*  president you're walking through a crowd somebody comes up to you like pulls a gun wants to shoot
*  the president his point is if you're the secret security guy and your first instinct in response
*  to someone pulling a gun is to go for your own gun you've lost a second and a half right your
*  hand's got to go down to your your whole focus is on getting to your own gun and in the meantime
*  the other guy whose gun's already out has already shot you've lost you need to be someone who
*  forgets about your own gun and just focuses on the on the man in front of you right and protecting
*  the president but it was all in the context of time is this really crucial um variable in these
*  kind of encounters and everything as a police officer you should be doing is slowing it down
*  um wait uh you know analyze what's happening and that's what he doesn't do the competence
*  instance speeds it up right he goes to DEFCON you know she lights a cigarette and within seconds
*  he's screaming at her this is a you know a parent shouldn't do that i mean let a little police
*  officer by the side of the highway right but the difference is he knows she's not a criminal
*  i mean he must know it's bullshit he's pulling her over because he's trying to write a ticket
*  and the way he's communicating with her when she lights a cigarette it's like she's inferior
*  like he this is not someone who's scared he's not scared of a perpetrator he's not scared that
*  there's a criminal in the car about to shoot him he's not scared of that at all he he wants
*  utter total complete compliance and he's talking to her like like he's a drill sergeant but can't
*  can't both those things be true how so well in so in the deposition he gives which i get to the end
*  of the book and i got the tape of the deposition it's totally fascinating it's like he's sitting
*  down with the investigating officer in looking into the death of sandra plant and he's got i
*  don't know how long it is two hours and he's walking them through what he was thinking that day
*  and he makes the case that he was terrified that he was convinced he he says he goes back to his
*  squad car he comes up and there's some there's some evidence to support this so he pulls her over
*  and he goes to the passenger side window and leans in and says ma'am you realize why i pulled
*  you over blah blah blah and is he okay because he she doesn't seem right to him she gives him
*  her license he goes back to his squad car and he says while he's in the squad car he looks ahead
*  and he sees her making what he calls furtive movements so he's like furtive movements also
*  he thinks she's being all kind of jumpy and you don't know he doesn't he just says i saw her
*  moving around in ways it didn't make me happy and then when he returns to the car he returns
*  driver's side which is crucial because if you're a cop you go driver's side only if you think that
*  you might be in danger right he doesn't if you go driver's side you're exposing yourself to the road
*  the only reason you do that is that when you're driver's side you can see the it's very very
*  difficult if someone has a gun to shoot the police police officer who's pulled them over if the police
*  officer is on the driver's side right you have an angle if they're on the passenger side so why
*  does he go if he thinks she's harmless there's no reason for him to go back driver's side i think
*  this guy i think these two things are linked i actually believe him he constructs this ridiculous
*  fantasy about how she's dangerous but i think that's just what he was trained to do he's a
*  paranoid cop and then why is he so insistent that she be compliant for the same reason because he's
*  terrified he's like do exactly what i say because i don't know what the what's going to happen here
*  right and she's you know i i don't know i i i don't think those two uh those two strains of
*  uh of interpretation are mutually exclusive that's interesting it didn't sound like he was scared at
*  all it sounded like he was pissed that she wasn't listening to him yeah i didn't i didn't think he
*  sounded even remotely scared i felt like he had i mean we're reading into it right right i have no
*  idea but from my interpretation was he had decided that she wasn't listening to him and he was going
*  to make her listen to him yeah that's what i got out of it i didn't get any fear and i thought that
*  version of it that he described just sounds like horseshit it sounds like what you would say after
*  the fact yeah to strengthen your case well the so there's another element here that i get into
*  which is i got his record as a police officer so he'd been on the on the force for i forgot nine
*  ten months and we have a record of every traffic stop he ever made and when you look at his list
*  of traffic stops you reason you realize that what happened that day with sandra bland was not an
*  anomaly that he's one of those guys who pulls over everyone for bullshit reasons all day long
*  so i think i forgot an exact number but in the hour before he pulled over sandra bland he pulled
*  over four people for other people for equally ridiculous reasons he's that cop and he's that
*  cop because he's been trained that way right that's a kind of quotas strange strain of modern policing
*  which says go beyond the ticket pull someone over if you if anything looks a little bit weird
*  because you might find something else now if you look at his history as a cop he almost never found
*  anything else his history as a cop in fact i went through this i forget how many hundreds of traffic
*  stops he had in nine months if you go through them he has like once he found some marijuana on a kid
*  and by the way the town in which he was working is a college town so i mean how hard is that
*  i think he found a gun once misdemeanor gun but everything else was like pulling over people for
*  you know the the light above their license plate was out that that's the level of stuff he was
*  using he did this all day long every day so he's like to him it's second nature yeah pull her over
*  like who knows what's going on she's out of state she's young black woman was this comparable to the
*  way the rest of the cops in the force in his division did it well i looked at i didn't look
*  at the rest of the cops on his force what i looked at were state numbers to the wherever there
*  several american states give us like north carolina for example will give us precise
*  complete statistics on the number of traffic stops done by their police officers and the reasons for
*  those stops so when you look at that so i have the i look at the north carolina numbers for example
*  in the north carolina how i patrol it's the same thing they're pulling over unbelievable numbers
*  of people and finding nothing like nine you know one percent less than one percent hit rates in
*  some cases of being hit right being finding something of interest so like they're pulling
*  over 99 people for no reason in order to find one person who's got you know a bag of dope or
*  something in the car you cannot conduct policing in in a civil society like that and expect to have
*  decent relationships between law enforcement and the civilian population yeah no question but
*  doesn't that sort of support the idea that he's full of shit that he was really concerned that
*  she had something he had never encountered anything well or or this was the one the fantasy in his
*  head is so what so the question is why does he keep doing it if this is a guy who day in day out
*  pulls over people for no reason and finds nothing and continues to do it now there's two explanations
*  one is he's totally cynical and thinks this is the way to be an effective police officer
*  explanation number two is this is a guy who has a powerful fantasy in his head that one day
*  i'm going to hit the jackpot i'm going to open the trunk and there's going to be
*  15 pounds of heroin and i'm going to be the biggest star whoever lived i think there's also
*  a rush of just being able to get people to pull over this the compliance thing which is another
*  reason why he was so furious that she wasn't listening to him yeah and she kept a cigarette
*  lit yeah or she was listening but not complying yes yeah um what are the laws i mean are you
*  allowed to smoke a cigarette in your car when a cop pulls you over how does it work like that
*  yeah i mean of course yeah they can't stop you from engaging they can't tell you to put out your
*  cigarette there's no law that no he could have said i mean no there's no law i mean the car though
*  two things the courts historically give enormous leeway to the police officers in a traffic stop
*  as opposed to a person-to-person stop but uh but no i mean this is about what he should have said
*  is he could have said um ma'am do you mind um i would prefer if you put out the cigarette while
*  we're talking or i'm allergic to smoke or whatever i mean he's a million ways for him to do it nicely
*  he's a jackass about it yeah but he's i mean he's basically doing the job like a jackass he's doing
*  a jackass version of being a cop well so this is so this is one of a really really crucial point
*  in the argument of the book which is i think the real lesson of that case is not that he's a bad
*  cop he's in fact doing precisely as he is was in trained and instructed to do he's a he's the ideal
*  cop and the problem is with the particular philosophy of law enforcement that has emerged
*  over the last 10 years in this country which has incentivized and encouraged police officers
*  to engage in these incredibly low reward activities like pulling over 100 people in order to find one
*  person who's got something wrong that has become enshrined in the strategy of many police forces
*  around the country they tell them to do this i have a whole section of book where i go through
*  in detail one of the most important police training manuals which is you know required reading for
*  somebody coming up and which they just walk you through this like it is your job to pull over
*  lots and lots and lots and lots of people even if you only find something in a small percentage of
*  cases why that's what being a proactive police officer is all about right so they are trained
*  that phrase go beyond the ticket is a is a term of art in police training like you got to be
*  thinking you sure you pull them over for having a tail light that's out but you're looking you're
*  thinking beyond that is there something else in the car that's problematic that's what you're
*  trying to find so there he was being a dutiful police officer and the the answer is to re-examine
*  our philosophies of law enforcement not to not i mean you can't dismiss this thing by saying oh
*  that's just a particularly bad cop it's not great but i don't know if he's any worse than
*  you know he's just doing what he was trained to do that's the issue he should be trained to do
*  something different right that is the issue right the issue is there this is standard practice
*  to treat citizens that are doing nothing wrong as if they're criminals and pull them over and
*  give them extreme paranoia and freak them out yeah i hope you find something i was home i'm
*  canadian and i was home in canada small town canada a couple weeks ago and i saw on the back you know
*  how these cars always have their often have their slogan on the side of the car the back of the car
*  so in my little hometown in southwest natterio sleepy you know farm country the the slogan on
*  the back of the police cars is people helping people so canadian right it is so awesome
*  and like the next now understand that this is a country with very very low levels of
*  gun ownership which means that a police officer does not enter into an encounter with a civilian
*  with the same degree of fear or paranoia that the civilian has a handgun right which is a big part
*  of this regardless of how one feels about gun laws in this country the fact that there are lots of
*  guns mean makes the job of a police officer a lot harder and every police officer will tell you that
*  in canada you don't have that fear but it's also canada and it's small town canada and so when you
*  encounter a police officer in my little town he's like he's people helping people he's like he's
*  like driving like a camry and he's you know he's like this genial person who was it really a camera
*  i mean i i forgotten exactly what they're driving they're not like they're not driving
*  cop cars yeah explorers painted black with like big bull bars at the front right uh and then you go
*  you know i was you go i mean even in la you know i like the cars are painted black and white they
*  look so they look ferocious i mean the whole thing is that what it is they look ferocious
*  do i just look they identify as police to canada to a canadian looks to me it looks a little why
*  do they have to paint them black for that's not the oakland raiders i mean it's like what do you
*  think they should paint them something mild and like bright yellow something lovely something
*  warm lovely like a nice can you imagine like a teal or okay lime green well that would be
*  yeah because there's a lot of black cars a lot of white cars not a lot of teal cars let's go with
*  so it would yeah it would stand out like oh it's a cop this pink car but you know this kind of
*  symbolism right matters right right you're projecting an image sheriff joe arpaio who
*  makes all of his prisoners wear pink yeah yeah that's kind of thing well i mean to
*  against his point though how many women shoot cops isn't that an insanely low number yeah i mean
*  insanely low i mean what what are the numbers i mean it's probably almost non-existent yeah when
*  guys pull over women i don't think they're worried about being shot i really don't
*  i think it's horseshit i think it's all after the fact yeah he was trying to concoct some sort of an
*  excuse something's going to excuse for um is he still in the force uh no he was he's either
*  he's kicked off for i've forgotten the precise language they use but for basically being impolite
*  to a civilian but um yeah i don't think there's a lot of um uh but i don't know whether i mean
*  i i still think we're saying the same thing which is the thing that's driving him his motivation is
*  not rational right and if you were a rational actor you would never engage in an activity where 99.9
*  percent of your police stops resulted in nothing right you he's he is often some weird kind of
*  fantasy land for a reason which is that's what in certain jurisdictions in this country that's what
*  law enforcement has come to look at look like um that's that's problematic it's a huge problem
*  yeah the the power trip aspect of it i mean you know i've often said what would they do
*  you know because there's certain there's certain areas where police officers do have quotas where
*  they have to write a certain amount of tickets what would they do if no one broke the law for
*  six months welcome to see that's what small town canadians yeah right that's right what would they
*  do i mean i would really be curious like what would happen to the numbers like because what
*  you're saying that they use people as an atm they really do i mean people are they're glorified
*  revenue collectors they're pulling people over trying to write huge tickets and i believe it's
*  north carolina where you're talking about that's got this creepy law that they've recently i think
*  they've recently changed it where you're allowed to just confiscate people's money because if you
*  see like i pull you over hey malcolm why do you have three thousand dollars on you yeah you have
*  three thousand dollars in cash what are you doing with three thousand dollars give me that money
*  and they take it and you have to prove that you weren't going to buy heroin or buy illegal guns
*  or whatever and then most of that money wound up going to the police department so they used it to
*  like build a fucking gym for the cops or whatever i mean it's literally they had an incentive to keep
*  the money and is that north carolina that they did that there's a number of states it is north
*  carolina that have those confiscation laws civil forfeiture laws yeah yeah and they're really
*  gross do they still have that or is i mean i know it's extremely controversial and people are up in
*  arms and furious that you know their money has been stolen people on their way to buy a car
*  for instance you know and they get pulled over and the cop will just take all the money this is what
*  um uh i talk a little bit about the ferguson case in my book later on and i this is what
*  ferguson was ultimately about the focus in the ferguson case was whether the officer in that
*  case is darren wilson what he did and didn't do to michael brown but the real story when the
*  department justice investigated the real story is not the encounter between those two it is that
*  that's that the police department in ferguson was being run as a revenue generating arm of
*  the city government and people in city government were directing uh the activities of law enforcement
*  to maximize revenue and this is incredible stories of there's one a story where uh there's a guy
*  who's just been playing basketball and he's sitting in his car parked by the basketball court like
*  cooling off after playing basketball cop rolls in pulls up behind him and ends up writing eight
*  tickets including accuses the guy being a pedophile gets him for uh one of the things he gets him is
*  putting a false name on his driver's license when his driver's license his real name was like
*  michael and his driver's license said mike like that's the level of eight tickets right that was
*  routine practice and so you you know you there's a reason why a kid like michael brown in ferguson is
*  he gets really angry at law enforcement because law enforcement was a completely discredited
*  institution in that city for years and years and years and years and years they had been
*  basically praying they'd been praying on the on the lower income community of that town so of course
*  relationships between the population and the cops had reached a low ebb that's a real you know there's
*  a it's funny the um one of the reasons i wanted to write this book was then the kind of conversations
*  we have around these things ferguson's a great example 95 of the conversation about ferguson was
*  just about trying to break down what happened between a cop and michael brown and the issue
*  when we finally look at it in a systematic manner we realize oh no no it's not about that it is
*  about a system that had been in place for years and years and years and years in which the the
*  the african-american population that town had been preyed upon by the police department that
*  is the broader and you cannot come to an understanding of what happened with michael brown
*  until you're willing to engage that case on that much more broader systemic level
*  when you make the title of this book talking to strangers are you do you have a goal that
*  you're trying to achieve are you trying to illuminate a certain aspect of communication
*  are you trying to highlight issues that people have had with these stories like the
*  michael brown story or yeah i mean i'm trying to i wanted to sort of start with the premise of why
*  are we so bad at you know like i tell the story in a book of the larry nasser case at michigan state
*  which one's that's the guy remember the doctor for the gymnastics team oh it turns out to have
*  been sexually molesting yeah huge pedophile so there you have a case where everyone thinks they
*  know this guy he's their friend he's this gifted doctor the parents are willingly bringing their
*  kids to to be treated by him the parents are in the room while he is abusing their kids and they
*  don't see it the kids are saying something weird happened and the parents are dismissing it
*  so i wanted to that's a good example of a phenomenon that i wanted to try and explain
*  which is how is that possible how can we think we know someone and be so completely
*  wrong how can you take your kid to a doctor and think the doctor is the greatest possible doctor
*  and in fact what he's doing is abusing your child in front of you right and that's a very similar
*  kind of problem to bernie made of people invested their life savings with this guy
*  not not little old ladies in debuque sophisticated savvy incredibly intelligent investors handed over
*  millions of dollars to this guy who was not even true i mean the made-off fraud was so outrageous
*  he didn't even bother to him he didn't even put it in t bills i mean he just spent it it was just
*  like crazy what's t bills treasury bills oh i mean he wasn't even he was he was a 100 percent
*  uh sociopath fraud yes and people over the course of 20 years wrote check after check after check
*  after check to him thinking was this brilliant investor you know it's like that's a puzzle that's
*  what i wanted to get like people did recognize that something was wrong right there were financial
*  analysts that were saying that this doesn't make sense a few of them but it's funny there's a
*  my favorite story um on the in the made-off chapter is the greatest hedge fund in the world
*  is renaissance technologies these are the guys out in long island who have had like
*  30 returns for 25 years they're like all phd are you know ai genius literally geniuses
*  and they found themselves years before bed off was busted they found themselves with i think 30
*  million dollars in a made-off fund because of some complicated transaction and they're all
*  geniuses so they look at what made-ups doing and they're like i don't look good like that doesn't
*  make any sense to me and so like what should we do we have 30 million dollars stake in a fund and
*  we don't understand what the guy's doing and you would think logically they would sell their stake
*  they don't because it's returning no in fact it's not even returning that their own legit returns
*  are twice his illegitimate returns they're making they actually make the point that his returns are
*  really low for us like there's no reason for us to keep their money but they don't sell well so
*  that's what i was trying to understand like they can't even you know there's this notion i talk
*  about this called default to truth which is this idea it's from a researcher called tim levine
*  which is as human beings we're trusting engines we are evolved to give people the benefit of the
*  doubt and once you understand that and why do we do that because it's the right move 99 percent of
*  the time most people are being truthful and if you have as your strategy i'm going to believe what
*  people say it makes you a fantastic friend a wonderful person to work with it means that you
*  can you know escape through the world with a minimum of fuss if you're the paranoid person
*  is a person whose life is a nightmare right because they are suspicious of everything that moves
*  so we evolved to be trusting engines because that makes your life easier that's the best part of
*  human people want to mate with you like if you want to talk in evolutionary terms about who passes on
*  their genes nice people pass on their genes given the choice between having a child with a crazy
*  suspicious paranoid person or a loving trusting person you choose a loving trusting person
*  100 percent of the time so multiply out times a million years of human history you realize
*  trusting genes beat paranoid genes every day of the week right so that's what we are we're credulous
*  by by by evolutionary choice so those guys that in the uh at renaissance they're they're no different
*  they may be smarter than the rest of us but they're not constructed differently their inclination
*  is to believe people and like well i don't know guy says he's a good investor meh why not let's
*  hang on to it see what happens right that's their motive they don't they don't you don't get to to
*  run a organization as successful as renaissance technologies if you're some crazy paranoid person
*  right how would you even invest in anything if you were crazy and paranoid there was a lot of
*  people that were really intelligent that invested in bernie made off's hedge fund too stephen
*  spielberg was one of them he lost a shit ton of money oh yeah i mean look at the roster list
*  there isn't a you cannot point to an unsophisticated investor on the list of people who lost the most
*  money from every one of them is smart that's strange it's so great it is crazy like think
*  about it like and by the way getting a decent return in the market is super easy you you go
*  to you know vanguard and they you know they'll give you the market return you're in your ass
*  not that hard but these people are like they wanted to do something fancier and they and that's
*  what happened well he when you realize what a sociopathy actually was is in the interviews
*  after he's caught or he's demanding certain things and complaining about certain things he doesn't
*  seem to have any remorse none and he wants better treatment he wants better food he doesn't seem to
*  have any remorse that he's you know literally robbed people of their retirement yeah ruin the
*  last part of their lives where they thought they were going to have a considerable sum of money to
*  sit back and just enjoy their grandchildren no now they're broke now they're poor yeah now they have
*  to figure out a way to get by and eat he doesn't give a shit he does he doesn't in fact what's
*  weird there's so many things weird about the main off case um one of them is we forget that he doesn't
*  get caught he turns himself in right and he turns himself in because uh not because he's screwing
*  up but because he's quote unquote so good because remember the financial crisis hits in 2008 and his
*  clients are losing so much money on their legit investments that they go to man up and say can
*  i have some of my money back from you i got to pay off all the stuff i've done that has gone sour
*  so like in effect no one ever caught him he gets caught by a once in a you know one in a million
*  circumstance where he's the only one making any money for his clients so they come after him my
*  point is if you if you're totally rational and you look at this you say here's a guy who managed to
*  bamboozle the most sophisticated people in the world to the tune of billions of dollars for 25
*  years and only gets caught because we had a once in a lifetime financial meltdown isn't the rational
*  lesson of that that we should all be bernie madeoffs right it's like super easy it's like not that hard
*  i could all i have to do is you know he dressed really nicely i get really nice office space
*  on the east side of manhattan what what did he actually do nothing really didn't invest in
*  anything he just moved other people's money around and he ran a ponzi scheme he spent a lot of it
*  and how did his sons not catch on to this it's a good question because they're not being well one
*  of them committed suicide right that's right um and then so it's an open question of how much they
*  do how much anyone else knew um i you know the older i get the more i believe in the powers of
*  particularly within within family denial is something now i don't find hard to believe
*  so your ability i've now heard so many stories of you know a parent is some kind of monster
*  and family members just won't see it they just can't bring themselves to go that so did they
*  know something everyone knew there was something slightly fishy in what bernie was doing but they
*  never went so far as to think that he was just making it up so they knew something was up but
*  they didn't know it was 100 horseshit they thought that he was so there were some people thought that
*  he actually had investments but he was there was a suspicion for example he was front running that
*  because he had a larger business um uh sort of managing the the deal flow in the nasdaq
*  that he would get advanced word of where money was flowing and he would jump ahead of the queue
*  buy stocks before other people did and profit off the when the stock would rise he would just
*  have that difference so there was a feeling that he had a dubious kind of illegitimate strategy
*  that nonetheless legitimately made him a lot of money so people were like well as long as he can
*  get away with it and i could profit off it i'm fine but the truth is he wasn't doing that at all
*  and truth is he was just he was he had his he had some confederate in the attic of his company
*  essentially making up trade orders from scratch i mean they were just making shit up did how many
*  people got arrested i forget i think they took i can't remember the exact number i think they got
*  he had two confederates i think who went down with him that's it i think that's what it was
*  in retrospect it's a really it's one of these crazy it's one of these crazy you'd think it you
*  know that whole institutions would have fallen yes no did you ever hear the conversation that he had
*  i believe it was recorded somehow on a phone or something or maybe it was after he was in jail
*  where he was talking about trying to get money back from one of his biggest investors the guy
*  had gotten like a billion dollars from him over the years right that's right yeah he's like you
*  got to give the money back he's like fuck you i'm not giving you shit yeah and you know there's this
*  crazy conversation where he's basically telling this guy look you knew this was bullshit and you
*  were making money off this and now you know yeah yeah so so this is like the clever so if you think
*  about this that guy i know exactly what you're talking about yeah so so game this through let's
*  let's let's do a let's do a um a uh a hypothetical scenario okay you have a friend who is an
*  incredible salesman and has gone around europe into saudi arabia and raised a 20 million dollar fund
*  20 billion dollar fund and they're promising a 20 return a year on your investment right so you
*  give them a million you're getting 200 000 a year back from this thing you know it's all bullshit
*  but no one else does what is the rational thing for you to do the rational thing for you to do
*  is to take your on your million dollar investment is to take the 200 000 that is made made in
*  quotation marks every year out of the fund so you say most people you know when you invest in
*  stocks not only what you do is you check the box i want my i want any dividends or earnings
*  reinvested in the fund don't check the box take the real cash so if you're investing with this
*  phony friend of yours for 20 years you're going to get 200 000 a year for 20 years that's four
*  million dollars you will make four million clear of your out of your one million initial investment
*  in uh in 20 years right that's smart if you know what's going on so that's what some people did
*  with made off they're like yeah i don't know what he's doing these returns are pretty fantastic
*  i'm just going to take all my earnings off the table every single year so they are the ones who
*  the real winners of this whole thing with those people because this money's not real that money's
*  coming from other investors is nothing's being made actually what happens with them like if a guy
*  does make all these millions of dollars like that one guy he had to so he had to give some of it
*  back yeah so what happens is they appoint remember they appoint a after the scandal breaks and made
*  up is invested they bring in a kind of supervisor financial supervisor who has the power to claw back
*  winnings from money from the people who took who took cash off the table so but not everyone had
*  to claw back and the question was how far back do we go so if you were investing if you were
*  investing with made off 25 years ago and you took you know 10 million off the table between
*  1990 and 1993 do you have to give that up too like it gets complicated also how can you prove that
*  he was doing the same activity back then exactly exactly oh it's a conversation i really wish i
*  could remember where i was hearing this conversation but somebody had recorded made off talking to this
*  guy telling him look you got to give that money back yeah yeah yeah my Schwab fund looks better
*  and better all the time it's just so scary to me that i mean finances and the stock market and all
*  that stuff has always looked like magic like what is going on there what are they doing they're
*  moving these numbers around like when you see the ticker tape roll by like what what is all that if
*  you don't have any understanding of it it's like a foreign language yeah and so you're hoping that
*  all these geniuses can't be duped all these people throwing their tickets up in the air and
*  everybody that's like a buy sell they all know what's going on you don't know what's going on
*  but hey there's a lot of things you know that they don't know and this is just how the world
*  works yeah turns out no turns out the people that were involved in this crazy very difficult to
*  understand thing didn't know it either yeah like they barely can understand it and this guy was
*  just stealing money in some weird way and if the stock market didn't crash if we didn't have some
*  sort of a depression who knows how long he might still be in operation today he would so without
*  without the crash of 2008 there's a very very strong possibility that birdie madeoff would
*  still be going gangbusters all he has to do to keep surviving is to take in enough money to cover
*  withdrawals yes so there's some like we say there's a some portion of people who are withdrawing their
*  winnings he just needs to make enough to get new enough new money to cover the withdrawal so
*  he's got a 50 billion dollar hedge fund and let's imagine there's a billion in withdrawals coming out
*  every year he's got to raise a billion now if you're burning you already have 50 it's not that hard
*  to raise another and particularly because he had people all around the world and he was giving them
*  these huge fees to raise money for him so that's the other way the people who really made money
*  from him were the people who had i forgotten what it was but you would be say you're you're
*  you're joe the financial guy in zurek you have a whole bunch of wealthy european clients bernie
*  would let for every for every million you raise for bernie bernie would let you keep i forgot what
*  it was 100 grand that's a nice business that's real money so you just kick back 900 to bernie
*  and keep 100 grand and that you're free free and clear no one's clawing that back right those guys
*  got very very very very very very wealthy oh that's weird money you're sitting in your house that
*  stealing built god that's got to be strange so what can be learned in terms of communication
*  from the bernie made-off story well the the bernie made-off story and uh all you know all of these
*  ways but this one in particular goes to this question of we really think we're good at spotting
*  liars and we're not so virtually every profession that is invested in you know in in investigation
*  of human beings has some belief that you know we know how to figure out who's lying yes and the
*  truth is nobody does and if someone tells you they are good at spotting liars there's a 99
*  chance that they're lying so the the evidence the the so you could think if we did an experiment
*  here where i had a hundred people parade through this office right now the studio right now and
*  every one of them made a statement in front of you and some were lying and someone's telling the
*  truth and i asked you joe tell me who's lying who's not your accuracy rate your success rate
*  would be uh 52 to 54 percent in other words slightly better than chance you might as well
*  flip a coin um slightly better if you don't and that's not about you anyone in that chair
*  watching these people parade in front of us is going to do a slightly bit better than chance
*  and the reason we're slightly better than chance is there are a small fraction of people who are
*  such epically bad liars that there's just we're not going to lose those people like we those are
*  obvious one thing that you can tell though is if it's an area of your own personal expertise right
*  like if someone tried to talk to you about what it takes to write a book and get a book published
*  and get a book on the new york times bestseller list and they were just making things up you would
*  you would okay so that so this is oh so now you're talking about a separate thing here specialist
*  that's content based so if i pretend to be a ufc fighter you're going to spot my liar my lies in
*  five minutes because you know more about the content than i do but let's remove but there
*  you're not catching me because i look like i'm lying you're catching me because i'm saying
*  something that's bullshit i have a good story about that i have a good story i used to think
*  that i was really good at spotting liars and then i met this guy i met him through a friend and that's
*  i'd given myself a pass and then i met him through this friend he was a friend of a friend so i just
*  assumed he was okay because my friend is a very good friend um and this guy was claiming to be
*  this brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt and he was writing for this online um magazine that was like
*  a well-read magazine in the martial arts world and it was the abu dhabi combat club they were
*  responsible for this big uh the abu dhabi submission world championships this is the
*  biggest championships in the world it's very highly regarded high prestige um this guy was
*  talking about these uh fights that he had had and you know people bullshit a little bit so you give
*  people a little bit of room for that but then he was talking about this particular move that he had
*  pulled off in a fight that he had just learned from my friend and it's a very difficult move it's
*  called the twister it's basically a guillotine from wrestling and it's set up from a position
*  called side control it's really complicated you have to wrap someone's leg around you have to roll
*  onto your left shoulder you have to get behind them you have to grab their arm put it over your
*  shoulder grab a hold of their spine and it's essentially like a spine lock it's a very
*  difficult move to pull off and it takes a long time to master the steps it takes a long time
*  to understand the position so this guy learned it and then a couple days later claimed to have
*  pulled it off in thailand and it was like it's like one of those scenes in a movie with a record
*  scratches and everybody just goes what and i remember we were like what's going on
*  so then uh my friend winds up uh rolling with him rolling is sparring it's uh you do jiu-jitsu
*  rolling and he comes back to me and he goes there's no fucking way that guy's a blackpout it doesn't
*  even make sense he goes he's like he doesn't know what the fuck he's doing like this is really weird
*  so um he winds up having this confrontational conversation with him on the phone while i'm in
*  the car he's talking to him and he goes i want to know what you are because you're not a fucking
*  blackball so tell me what's going on he says no no no i'm a black belt in japanese jiu-jitsu it's
*  different this time goes on he tells this guy to go fuck himself time goes on the guy winds up
*  killing someone he winds up murdering this girl that he's having sex with murdering her husband
*  and he gets caught driving around her his car the guy's car after he's killed the guy
*  and then he winds up trying to recruit a friend to kill someone it's like this whole big thing
*  and he winds up going to jail and he's in jail now but i remember thinking okay you don't know
*  shit about catching and spotting liars because you didn't you didn't spot that guy as being
*  completely full of shit like i thought he was a little full of shit but i didn't know he was a
*  like a complete sociopath and a murderer yeah yeah so this is an interesting question using
*  that scenario would you have done a better job if all i gave you was the transcript of this guy
*  speech so there's this is a there's a lot of interest in this question in the community
*  of people who study deception so there's many different i can suppose i'm trying to improve
*  my ability to spot lies i can we can do three things i can listen to you face to face as you're
*  telling me something is either true or false i can we could do this entirely on the telephone
*  so i don't see you i just hear you or i can just read the transcript of what you say and try to
*  decide whether it's true or false and it seems to be the case that we're better when we just when we
*  remove sight and sound and all we have are uh this the word the plain words on the page there
*  was the there is what being present does um is it introduces all kinds of um uh of noisy information
*  that just distracts us from the core question of whether the truth is being told so maybe it was
*  maybe if all you have was a transcript and as this guy is describing this particular what was the
*  name of the move it's a twister the twister maybe as you're looking at the way he described
*  and all you're doing is focusing on the precise way in which he describes this very very intricate
*  move and you would realize oh he actually doesn't understand what he's talking about and you would
*  have seen it clearly in that moment if you but maybe there was something about his presentation
*  that threw you off the scent it was the move itself it's see because if he just said oh i
*  got it i got the guy in an armbar well a lot of people catch people in armbars it's it's a very
*  common move you learn it first day of jujitsu yeah you can catch someone someone makes a mistake
*  in your white belt and they reach up and you grab their arm you can catch an armbar yeah twisters
*  very difficult to pull off very difficult yeah it's only been done in the ufc
*  maybe once i think chan sung jung the korean zombie pulled it off once he may be the only guy
*  yeah this guy was delusional it was horse shit and the only thing that we were taking into
*  consideration like he was supposedly fighting in thailand which turns out there was no fight at all
*  he's a complete liar yeah um the only thing that we were taking into consideration was maybe this
*  guy fought a scrub like he could have fought someone who really didn't know anything he said
*  let me try the twister on him but then that's like you'd have to be beating the guy so badly
*  you just would end the fight you wouldn't do a twister on him the only time you do a twister is
*  if you're a highly skilled grappler and you think you could put someone in a position that they
*  don't understand it's a confusing position it's a position that there's a common position called
*  back mount where you would choke someone or you would transition to other moves from there
*  and he was almost there but not quite there because you're kind of on the side so even
*  seasoned grapplers occasionally make mistakes and get caught in the twister but you have to be a
*  fucking wizard to pull that off on somebody it's not something you have to be really good
*  it's not something that you can just do so when he said he did it we were all like what
*  it was if he said he head kicked the guy and knocked him out oh well that well that happens
*  all the time he said he punched the guy hit him with an elbow and cut him the referee stopped
*  the fight all that stuff is real that happens all the time he chose this one signature move
*  of my friend eddie and we were both like there's something wrong here man yeah something wrong
*  here there's a hilarious version of this on i'm a runner and i'm on all the the running message
*  board there's one called let's run which is this and they're constantly catching people who lie
*  about their marathon times it's it's a hilarious little catch them well there's all kinds of
*  reasons but a lot of it is it starts with the eyeball test so there'll be a you know because a
*  lot of marathons have they take pictures of the marathons and they're like oh my god
*  of the participants at various points during the race and someone will claim to run like
*  a 240 marathon now 240 you do really good to run it's not world class running but it's very good
*  to be serious to run 240 so they'll eyeball someone who claims to run 240 they'll say no
*  i mean just looking at them 10 you know 10 15 extra pounds right there they should be they should
*  look like they've been running they look totally fresh as a daisy right now they're what are they
*  doing wearing those shoes no 240 marathon it's like is that kind of process and then there's the
*  second order where they do complicated analysis of splits and they do all this kind of thing
*  but it often begins with the same thing it's like you these guys trying to claim to be this and it's
*  like no no no that's not working that's like a i love those insider-y well i have this thought
*  about how much culture has shifted through the internet and how much culture will shift again
*  in even more astronomical way once we can read minds and i don't think we're far away from that
*  i think we're a few decades away from some technology that allows people to establish
*  intent and to see thoughts and i think they're very there's some sort of theoretical work they're
*  doing on this right now and there's there's different models that they're trying to achieve
*  i think that's going to eliminate a lot of the bullshit of communication and i think it's going
*  to happen really quickly just like google sort of eliminates a lot of the bullshit of people telling
*  stories about something and someone goes what what happened wait a minute what year and they
*  google it that didn't happen and they can find out like almost instantaneously i think we're going to
*  be able to figure that out with people i think there's going to be a way where you can where we
*  can see intent and we can read minds i don't think we're far away from that yeah i mean i know
*  this neural link thing with elon mush is very elon's very hush hush about these different sort of
*  electronic brain interfaces that they're trying to uh experiment with yeah but wouldn't wouldn't
*  your worry be that if we read we're able to read someone's thoughts intentions what we would in
*  fact discover is uh even more confusing than what we know now in other words maybe what's inside my
*  head right now are 35 different thoughts and intentions warring at with each other murder
*  scenarios yes murder scenarios then malcolm just sort of keeps everything everything on the surface
*  super normal i think it's totally true think about it most of us there's any number of things think
*  about the yes the list of the list of possible things that could come out of my mouth at this
*  very moment is infinite right it is infinite there are at this very moment god knows how many
*  scenarios swirling around my head about what should i say next right and why is my intention
*  to try and make you laugh to impress you to piss you off to disagree with you to agree with you i
*  mean we can go on and on all those are in play so you really want to look inside my head and
*  not going to get clarity it's going to be a mess or we're going to realize we're all a mess
*  yes like it'll make us feel a little bit better like oh everybody's out of their fucking mind
*  but would you want that yes you would yes i'm endlessly curious about i know my mind is such
*  a mess and there's so much chaos going on there i want to know what's going on in other people's i
*  want to know how fucked up am i or am i normal is it standard here's my fear i have many fears
*  about this kind of thing but my fear would be as follows that um i cannot count the number of times
*  when i have had reactions to things that people have said in the moment that turn out to be wrong
*  deeply and badly wrong and one of the things that i have learned as an adult is to deeply distrust
*  those kinds of reactions and to wait and very often what will happen in my case sometimes the
*  waiting takes a long time i'm the kind of person who sometimes a month will pass and i will think
*  back on a situation and i'll think oh my god i totally misunderstood that this person who i
*  thought was a jackass is actually someone you know a lovely person who i should give a second chance
*  to or whatever that comment that someone made that i thought was stupid is in fact extremely
*  thoughtful and insightful this will happen weeks months later whatever if you were able to read my
*  mind in the moment you would judge me for my mistake and not give me an easy way to correct it
*  in other words you would trap me in like what if this would have had a reaction to something you
*  said in this conversation in which i've said jesus i can't believe that that's dumb and then i'm
*  driving back to la tonight and i think oh actually oh that's really interesting i hadn't thought
*  about the time i don't want you to short circuit my learning process about you i want i want to
*  give me the privacy of my my six hours of thinking about what you said and allow me
*  give me that kind of time to come to a reasoned and insightful conclusion about how i feel that's
*  interesting but we're talking then about only one person having the technology because if you both
*  have the technology then there wouldn't be any issue it wouldn't be confusion as to why someone
*  was saying something you'd you'd you have a much clearer path to understanding their thought
*  process and their intent behind it really yeah just get i mean if one person has it right then
*  yeah i get it yeah if i can read your mind oh i said something and malcolm thinks i'm a retard
*  like you know there's that but there's another there's another possibility that both people have
*  it and this is also one of the things that would be fascinating about this is one one of things
*  about forbidden words is forbidden words carry with them intent they have automatic intent right
*  but you can say the exact same word and have different intent behind it if we could understand
*  clearly what your intent is then taboo words would automatically become meaningless it wouldn't mean
*  it's not about sound you make it's not about forbidden sounds what it's about is thoughts
*  yeah and what you're trying to convey and what's happening to you as a human being who are you like
*  what what what is your process for the way you communicate what is your process for the way
*  you're trying to uh develop these thoughts in your mind and express them to people well well part of
*  the problem with that is language right and part of the problem with making certain aspects of our
*  language forbidden is you limit people's ability to colorfully communicate and express themselves
*  in certain ways i think that alone just eliminating that alone eliminated in confusion and also
*  highlighting you know you could highlight real problems with people's thoughts and the way people
*  communicate but also eliminate many problems so you'd say oh he doesn't mean that like you
*  could see what he means like this is what this is where his mind is you could see you could literally
*  see the thoughts yeah yeah i guess i would also let me let me get let me throw another complicating
*  factor it still leaves the question of cultural context yes so of course one of the things i
*  got really interested when i was writing my book was how our kind of cultural frames of reference
*  um profoundly um complicate our attempts to understand other people and so in your scenario
*  where i have some kind of window into your thinking and intention i still need to know
*  in order to make sense of you i still need to have a very clear idea of the the cultural kind of rules
*  of the road that you're using and they're likely to be different from mine sure particularly if
*  you know i mean i'm a canadian and you're not um but imagine if the difference between us was
*  more profound if i was you know then you you're still like like i was there's a really cool thing
*  i've i've been obsessed with um uh with memory i'm doing things on memory in my in revisions history
*  this coming season and i was reading about this really fascinating experiment which is done with
*  korean and american college students adults essentially and what i do is i give you three
*  circles paper circles and one is past one is present one is future and i say those are three
*  concepts represent those three concepts um uh with these three circles so the american kid has
*  passed here present in the middle future over on the right right three independent circles
*  the korean kid puts all piles all three circles on top of each other now what does that mean i
*  don't know what that means it means something interesting right it means that they don't they're
*  not separating these three modes the way that we are they're certainly coming at experience
*  with a very different set of assumptions so maybe so i think of the civil wars a long time ago but
*  if i'm korean maybe the civil war is as present in my kind of consciousness as something that
*  happened last week is that maybe that's what that means i'm not exactly sure i'm sort of guessing
*  because i don't know the i haven't fully investigated but the point is there are i've
*  just given you one random example there are way way incredibly different rules that different
*  cultures use to organize experience so if i'm looking at you and reading your thoughts i have
*  to know those rules because those rules are sorting out how people so this is only this is not i'm not
*  to i'm not dissing this notion of that you're talking about i'm saying that it needs to have
*  another layer as well a cultural layer a cultural layer which kind of alerts me to how you're
*  organizing experience no that certainly makes sense it's it's interesting when you think about
*  like the tower of babel right like this this idea that at one point in time everyone spoke the same
*  language and god sort of set it up so that it was we're never going to be able to really communicate
*  with each other because everybody has a bunch of different languages and we'll we'll we'll never
*  figure it out that's the sort of crunched up version of it if there was a way to
*  change the way like all languages are essentially little symbols that are written down on paper
*  are typed out and then sounds you make with your mouth and they convey intent if there was a way
*  to do another version of language a universal version of language that's eventually adopted
*  like i'm reading this book about these people that were kidnapped
*  by native americans and they were assimilated into the tribes they learned the the language
*  and this happened over a course of a couple of years and i was thinking like what would that be
*  like if you you know that's how you learn a language you're kidnapped by you know what i mean
*  but if there was a new language how long would it take for adults to learn a new language if someone
*  came up with a new language of completely universal characters and this language is
*  conveyed through this technology rather than through your mouth so it's your your your thoughts
*  your thoughts interface with some sort of technology it creates whatever hieroglyphs some sort of
*  visual language that we all agree upon and then this is universal this is universal throughout
*  all cultures yeah and the only thing that we we'd be confused about assumptions and rules as far as
*  like what's okay what's not you could do that can't can't we kind of do that already in a sense that
*  we could have a universal language and then we have a device you know sitting on our phone or
*  something yeah that when we i'm in you know i'm in some for i'm in bulgaria and i'm ordering coffee
*  i speak in the device and it simply translates either translates me directly into bulgarian
*  that's actually not that hard no um or it translates this into this common language that the
*  bulgarian translator services and if you think of the technology at a slightly more advanced level
*  than it is now it could be done in a very seamless um uh way like it doesn't have to be some bulky
*  it could literally be that um i am speaking in english and what you're hearing is there's a
*  filter and what you're what you're hearing is this other language i mean well don't don't google
*  buds or whatever they are there's the air you know the airpod version of those google things i think
*  there's something some technology that actually enables you to instantaneously translate that
*  yeah google will do it for you yeah although you hate for google to have one more thing over us
*  right it's like not enough that they should control nine tenths of our life yeah we're also
*  going to let them control our communication i remember as a kid reading i used to love
*  dunesbury did you read yes and there's a hilarious thing in dunesbury where i forgot who uncle duke
*  or somebody is going to china and the was uncle duke hunter s thompson yeah he was and he was
*  appointed ambassador i think he was appointed american ambassador to china and and that was a
*  joke and he would go and he would meet with like the head of you know the president of china and
*  he would say the most incredibly incendiary outrageous things and the translator never
*  translated what he said would turn he would say this outrageous offensive thing and the translator
*  was saying you know the flowers are blooming today i just thought it's hilarious yeah jamie had a
*  thought once that hieroglyphs for 2019 are essentially emojis oh yeah yeah it's kind of
*  i mean that what you're sort of saying is yeah like the internet you have to translate english
*  into bits in order for the computer to translate it into an emoji it's almost i feel like that's
*  almost what you're saying although it's not exactly it's a being it's a beginning step yeah it's like
*  step one to the competition but it just seems like this is not the best we can do
*  north noises with your mouth and then you know learning english is incredibly complicated for
*  someone who speaks mandarin and vice versa yeah you know it's all very what if we we all said hey
*  look this is some new version of a language like whenever there's a whether it's contact or whenever
*  there's some movie about extraterrestrials there's always a team of scientists and linguists and
*  geniuses to get together and they go look we're going to establish a universal language they
*  communicate with these people in close encounters the third kind it was music do do do do do that
*  they would figure out some way we're going to figure out a way to talk if we had some enormous
*  financial incentive or some enormous crisis was in play and we had to all communicate with the same
*  language and so remember when they were trying to push them well you're from canada the the metric
*  system was actually real over there it was real you know when i was in high school they were trying
*  to push the metric system yeah and i remember there was like a concerted effort they're like
*  we're gonna have to learn the metric system because the universal system that the whole world uses and
*  they gave up the united states gave up why did why was this possible in canada not possible in
*  the united states because we're assholes you guys are 20 less assholes at least 20 percent there i
*  don't know how is that possible i've always thought because i grew up in boston which is also cold
*  i've i always thought cold weather made assholes because it's like you just like fuck it's cold
*  fuck this fuck you fuck you because boston is filled with people that want to get drunk and
*  fight and then a lot of them are really mean which is a great place to grow up you develop a thick
*  skin in particular like as a comedian it's a great place to start out and do comedy you learn how to
*  do it right i don't think boston is mean because of the cold i think yeah i think is canadian's
*  the coldest parts of canada like the you know i know lots of people lots of members of my family
*  are from winnipeg which is seriously cold nicest people nicest people yes it doesn't make any sense
*  that's what i said it does my theory sucks i think it's the children of very rough immigrants and
*  they stayed in these communities and irish and italians yes exactly that's what i am and so the
*  immigrants of these people that were willing to take a risk and get on a boat when there wasn't
*  even youtube videos to watch these are savage people that made it over here and they're really
*  rough and they had rough childhoods and they raised rough children and the echoes of that
*  persist on the east coast of the united states the amount of drinking that went on in irish
*  immigrant communities is there's it's funny because i stumbled across years ago i was i've
*  always been obsessed with drinking and alcohol in fact i have a chapter that on it in this book
*  but um so years ago turns out that the place in america where alcohol studies as they're called
*  were really birthed was new haven which makes perfect sense so in the 50s a bunch of people
*  get really really interested in understanding how drinking works and in new haven of course you have
*  the perfect model because you have two very large groups of immigrants you have irish italians right
*  in all of new england you've got those two to work with and of course they could not be more
*  different in the way they drink so even in immigrant italian communities in the 50s these
*  are people who are in terms of volume of alcohol consumed way up at the top they're drinking with
*  every meal they're making you know wine and in their backyards they are but the levels of alcoholism
*  are infinitesimal the amount of like social dysfunction associated with drinking can't i mean
*  it's just not it's negligible these are the healthiest drinkers you can imagine side by side
*  are the irish and i don't need to tell you that the story is very different
*  why is that it's super interesting question you've got so they're not one group's not richer than the
*  other they come to america not at the same time but they're in 19th century early 20th century come
*  to america in large numbers there are some you know irish culture looks a lot but it was catholic
*  right now there may be catholic in different ways but there's a sort of on the surface these are you'd
*  think that they would use the bottle in the same way no the irish are the the irish the men are
*  slinking off to the pub and in italy everyone's gathered around a steaming bowls of pasta and
*  drinking like one and a half glasses of wine mild homemade wine with your dinner it's like
*  night and day yeah it's unbelievable is it because one is a whiskey culture
*  because whiskey is rough stuff i mean you really can't have much before you're off the rails
*  yeah there there's some of that yeah the the attachment to wine in the italian community
*  probably saves them a good deal of their of alcohol related heartbreak i don't know too much
*  about the actual what is there a difference between the way different alcohol effects is
*  does the wine alcohol actually affect you by volume by by by the actual percentage of alcohol
*  does it affect you differently than beer or differently than whiskey or differently tequila
*  because that's what people always say oh if i drink tequila i get crazy like people always have
*  these stories but is that true if you have you had a certain percentage of alcohol we equalize
*  yes we equalize the the alcohol concentration is it all the same in the end yes because for me
*  wine makes me warm and friendly and it makes me sleepy and it i mean it doesn't make me energetic
*  whiskey makes me crazy like i think it's a crazy drug i think when people drink shots of jack
*  daniels they just want to go whoa they they want to get crazy they want to do dumb shit it makes
*  them want to do dumb things shots in particular makes people want to do dumb things makes people
*  get crazy makes people loud that makes people irish right yeah yeah it's better you saying
*  well i'm quarter irish i can get away with it for a little while only a quarter that's it
*  yeah mostly italian oh i see you're at the cusp of these two drinking traditions yes yes oh i see
*  but rogan you're fooling us you're fooling us with rogan yes yes because we would think that
*  you were majority irish with that yes yeah and i could be dark irish if you looked at me if you
*  were yeah i'm well i'm you know i am um reserved uh english and jamaican jamaican's not big drinkers
*  you know in the same kind of uh uh the difference actually fascinatingly of the many weird alcohol
*  facts if you look at uh young people it's like it's like a college-age young people in america
*  and look at their drinking habits the uh uh black students drink and get drunk markedly less
*  than white kids real differences in drinking behavior by race in that age asian students
*  don't drink much either drinking is like a it's like a it's like a white thing it's a crazy white
*  thing increasingly in or problematic drinking i thought that was fascinating it is fascinating
*  i don't know i don't know i don't know why that's so it's revered in our culture more
*  it's uh yeah i mean getting fucked up is celebrated in white culture well this you know in the alcohol
*  chapter in my book the i talk about all the strange things that have happened with drinking patterns
*  on campus and i was struck in doing that chapter i was interested in the connection between drinking
*  and drunkenness and sexual assault on campus because all of those the overwhelming majority
*  if you talk to people who study sexual assault on campus they will tell you that you almost
*  never see one of these cases where both parties aren't drunk right it's um which doesn't explain
*  them entirely but it's a huge factor in making sense of what happens and when you dig into that
*  you see these like really weird patterns first off when i was in college i did not know and i
*  went to college in canada not a teetotaling population i did not know a single person who
*  had ever been black blackout drunk and then now if you talk to a 20 year old college student in
*  america they will name friends of theirs who get blackout drunk on a weekly basis what is the
*  drinking age in canada and what was it when you were in college when i was in college was 18 yeah
*  i think that might be a big factor i've been talking to friends about this about europe about
*  how in europe uh particularly in italy and france you're allowed to drink wine at a very young age
*  and the taboo aspect of it the forbidden fruit all that goes away it's a just it's a i don't think
*  young kids should be drinking because i think it's terrible for your brain development
*  but i think there's a thing in keeping them from drinking or making it illegal
*  where it becomes so taboo and so intoxicating that they can't wait until they can legally do it or
*  they try to get a hold of it before it's legal and it has a certain excitement to it that just
*  doesn't it doesn't have in parts of europe yeah you've given it a kind of so there's all kinds of
*  the things that are new are way less beer and way more hard liquor so hard liquor when i was in
*  school in canada in the 80s 95 of what we drank was beer it's just not there wasn't any whiskey or
*  even um or tequila or a vodka in our parties such as beer beer kegs keg parties yeah really hard to
*  get blackout drunk on beer i mean blackout to get the blackout you've got to be you got to get to
*  like i forgot what the exact number that's ten drinks or something well it's point you got to
*  blow like 0.18 or something i forgot what there's a sort of magic number where people is that for
*  everybody because some people they just get gerbilized like there's some dudes they'll have
*  a couple of drinks and they get shark eyes you know those those dark like expressionless eyes
*  like hey man you still here yeah like they're just wandering around like like a like a person
*  with doll eyes there's nothing there with issues back it is just at what point is your hippocampus
*  shut down and you cease to have the ability to make memories so that's just that's a very narrow
*  clinical explanation of so there may be a whole different set of manifestations of drunkenness
*  that have to do with alcohol's effect on other parts of your brain right but blackout is just
*  about your hippocampus and past a certain blood alcohol concentration your hippocampus just goes
*  offline essentially you just pull the plug on them and then so nothing that's coming in is being
*  stored wow so you can continue to communicate i could be blackout drunk right now but does it
*  vary with people does it the number well so yes it would it would it would vary depending i think
*  on drinking history and yeah but i mean as a there is it's there's a kind of a there's a consensus
*  figure where most people i i wish i it's in my book i wish i could remember i think it's something
*  like uh 0.16 or something like that if you think of the if the the level the legal level for drinking
*  for for driving is 0.08 i think it's roughly 2x that level and most people at that level will be
*  at risk will have at least the beginnings of memory impairment so that feeling when you get really
*  drunk at a party and the next morning you can only remember little bits and pieces of what happened
*  that night that's because your your hippocampus was at your moment of peak intoxication your
*  hippocampus was starting to shut down it just wasn't taking in new new memories it's really
*  interesting too because some of our most interesting minds and some of the best
*  communicators relied on alcohol heavily like and it made that like hitchens made it made him a more
*  interesting communicator when he was drunk when he would have a drink you know i mean right like
*  he would be on bill maher you could tell he was he was lit and and and he was so eloquent and so
*  articulate but that beautiful phrasing so remember though that's an interesting point
*  and a crucial point about blackout which is your hippocampus doesn't necessarily control your
*  uh your how articulate you are how fluid your speech is it's just about memory so hitchens could
*  have been the most articulate person in the world in just and but the next morning he would not have
*  remembered a single thing he said on bill maher i mean i'm assuming if he was i don't think he was
*  blackout no it wasn't no but but you don't know there's fascinating stories in the literature
*  about um when people were discovering blackout in the 50s and they would there would be these
*  stories like they would some guy would come in he would wake up in las vegas and he would say
*  what am i doing in las vegas like and he would go and he would see his clothes hanging in the closet
*  and he would say what what's going on and then he would like go down to the desk and say what
*  and he said oh you checked in last night and he would look in his wallet and he would see he had
*  a plane ticket from cleveland and they would reconstruct and there's a in fact this very
*  story was told in the you know one of the big medical journals in the 50s the guy reconstructs
*  he's a salesman living in like st louis who gets really really drunk and then his hippocampus shuts
*  down and he continues to function so he goes gets in his car drives to the airport buys a plane ticket
*  goes to vegas does he doesn't know what he does in vegas does whatever he does in vegas
*  and then wakes up like two days later oh my god hippocampus is suddenly back online he's like what
*  am i doing in vegas that is two days two days so the point is like the point is that you can you
*  you like that was my point i could be blackout right now and still communicate you wouldn't know
*  it i don't it's not like you can tell i can't tell whether you have a headache can i right no clue
*  so you don't know what's going i mean until we come up with that machine that you were talking
*  you can't tell that my hippocampus isn't working except if you answer if you ask me the same
*  question this is how you the only way you can do it you had a party you think someone's blackout
*  ask them the same question over and over again and see if they respond like say why you ask me so
*  literally i would say um wait did you say you're uh you're a quarter irish and then i would just
*  have to wait like say five seconds and say joe did you see her a quarter irish and in a certain
*  way you're gonna say malcolm why stop it if you don't say that you're blackout drunk but if you
*  do if you could you be blackout drunk and still have like a tiny memory no okay you just asked me
*  that okay so uh the hippocampus doesn't shut down all at once so what it does is it it shuts down
*  slowly so let's imagine we're both doing shots so after i mean i'm quite sure your capacity i'm
*  i mean you're like i'm half your weight am i but i don't know what you are you're like 200 pounds
*  i'm 126 okay so we're gonna deal with alcohol very differently but let's assume we're doing
*  shots of tequila uh there's a point where things start to get hazy so you might remember that i
*  answered that question you might not and then as we keep drinking in our blood alcohol levels get
*  higher and higher at a certain point your hippocampus will completely like the off switch
*  has been thrown so it goes from being sluggish and impaired to just being down like and what brings
*  it back uh well your blood alcohol level has to fall to the point where it can work again
*  so you fall asleep and over the course of eight hours of sleep you know your alcohol is processed
*  by your liver blood alcohol falls uh hippocampus snaps back into action wow what a ridiculous drug
*  to be our most socially acceptable drug yeah totally and then the vegas thing where they give
*  it to you for free of course in a place where you can gamble which is really sneaky yeah that's one
*  of the weirder laws ever that a person could literally lose their house while they're black
*  out drunk crazy i mean in retrospect imagining we're we let's do a little uh ranking thing here
*  we have three vices and i'm i know exactly uh where you're going to be going with this but um
*  we have three things we want to prioritize dope alcohol
*  uh smoking right cigarettes you can ban one actually rank them in order you can start from
*  scratch i'm saying joe we're starting over okay what you say goes rank you we can so right now
*  the way we have dealt with these is um smoking is is becoming the most taboo of those three cigarettes
*  uh uh marijuana second and alcohol is the one that we have the least inhibitions about right
*  my argument would be that that list is exactly backwards that it should be alcohol should be the
*  most taboo uh marijuana should be actually not exactly backwards it should be alcohol the most
*  taboo cigarettes the second most marijuana the third that's how i would do yeah i would agree
*  with that yeah yeah so we're but basically we have it completely upside down but i think um for some
*  people like look there's obviously obviously terrible things that happen to you when you smoke
*  cigarettes but every time is it is it pot i see i've smoked a cigarette or two before shows like
*  i've smoked a i mean i mean or two i've never smoked two in a row but i've smoked eight or
*  smoke two in a row but i've smoked a cigarette before i've done shows like dave chapelle gave
*  me one of his cigarettes recently uh tony hingecliffe's given me a cigarette i'm not a
*  cigarette smoker but there's something cool about the head rush that you get when you smoke a cigarette
*  i hesitate to say that and this is a person who's done a lot of drugs i've done a lot i've smoked a
*  lot of pot and i've done psychedelics and i talk about them openly i have hesitation about telling
*  people that i've enjoyed a cigarette because because it's because i think it's so bad for you
*  it's it's it's i think when i talk about doing mushrooms i think mushrooms are good for you i
*  think it makes you freak out i think it it illuminates parts of your consciousness that
*  i think a lot of people guard and protect and shield and i think sometimes doing something that
*  breaks down those walls is good for you ultimately overall there's a little bit of an adjustment
*  period but i think you learn something about the normal state of consciousness i don't think you
*  learn much when you smoke cigarettes i just think there's just a little bit of a head rush that you
*  get out of it but i know so many people that are sick from cigarettes so many people that can't
*  quit them so many people that have died from cancer i mean i personally have known several people that
*  have died from cancer from smoking cigarettes yeah so i hesitate in saying it but i don't want to be
*  dishonest i've had them yeah i don't smoke cigarettes though i've never bought a pack
*  that's a cigar i've smoked cigars i like them sometimes i just think it's a terrible
*  it's a terrible thing to get hooked on yeah yeah and as i would say the same thing with alcohol
*  i know people that have had real problems with alcohol that have been alcoholics and
*  they have to go to meetings and you know they're on 12 step programs and you know i would never
*  offer them a drink but if you said hey let's do a shot right now let's celebrate this is a
*  wonderful conversation let's have a glass of whiskey i can have a glass of whiskey and not
*  drink again it doesn't bother me i don't i don't have that whatever that is yeah but some people
*  do yeah i hesitate i hesitate in glorifying that too yeah and for young people it scares the shit
*  out of me if i see i i probably drank for the first time when i was probably like
*  i was in high school i think it's probably 14 or 15 first time i ever got drunk with my friends
*  you know we got a hold of some jack daniels or something and maybe throw up the irish legal
*  drinking age yes well you know just friends you know listening to yeah classic rock and getting
*  drunk and pasta but the it's it's something i occasionally enjoy i enjoy alcohol i like having
*  a drink of wine with a glass of wine with a meal i like having a drink with friends occasionally
*  but i don't have a problem with it and i know people who do and so i i feel weird talking about
*  it knowing those people that do have a problem with it yeah yeah with pot though the people that
*  have a problem with pot it's rare and it's usually people that have some sort of an and i do believe
*  there is an issue with people have some sort of an underlying schizophrenic issue that could come
*  from especially high doses if they smoke a lot of pot in one night they can have a schizophrenic
*  episode i've actually seen it particularly from edibles i've seen it but that's to me that's
*  absolutely the least taboo and i think there's a lot of benefits to pot i think pot makes you
*  more sociable i think it makes you friendlier i mean some people get paranoid from it but i think
*  that's what that really is is marijuana illuminating how vulnerable you actually
*  are yeah you know that we sort of protect ourselves from this overwhelming existential
*  angst that you get when you get high on pot yeah and people say i don't like it it makes me paranoid
*  well you know the reality is you're vulnerable we're all very very very vulnerable and we just
*  somehow or another make it to like how old are you 56 i'm 52 we made it we made it to this age
*  somehow or another despite all the paranoia we got here we don't have to i mean it's like really
*  you know life is crazy we're in these metal boxes with combustion engines you know like trusting the
*  people next to us going 60 miles an hour paying attention not looking at their phone you know
*  it's like it's very life and then we get in planes and who knows what the fuck's going on with the
*  engine this guy's flying it over the sky it's we're very vulnerable all the time there's diseases and
*  you know not to mention you know war and all sorts of other things that could well we're in
*  l.a. not to mention everything earthquakes yeah fires yes no my my thing on this is simply the
*  collateral damage yeah the so leave the individual out of it and ask how much
*  social damage is caused by any of those things and alcohol and that number one just by a by a
*  bullet yeah you know what's amazing to me is how the people who make alcohol
*  have get a free ride it's incredible to me that like if i said to you that i was on the board of
*  philip morris you would say that's malcolm that's pretty screwed up yeah and you would you would be
*  you have a problem with it if i said that oh i'm you know i'm on the board of anheuser bush
*  you probably would hit me up for tickets to the super bowl right it's just not the same
*  whereas there's no in terms of the amount of social damage what al what anheuser bush has created
*  has produced a hundred times the social damage than what philip morris has produced yeah right
*  like you know so it's like it's it's i've always puzzled about i don't know how we got it in our
*  heads like to to to treat one like it's completely taboo and the other we kind of shrug you know the
*  there are a bunch i was reading about this recently how many colleges except not just except
*  alcohol advertising and sponsorship but you go to a college football game and you know bud light
*  will have will be an active sponsor of the event will have some huge relationship with the school
*  this is crazy i mean it's crazy right it's like this is the drug that is causing so many problems
*  for young people particularly on campuses and the schools are hand in glove with the manufacturers
*  of it because it's socially acceptable because they don't have to worry about repercussions
*  and the way that they would never have marlboro marlboro yeah that would be oh my god people would
*  pick it yeah whereas it's not you know i don't know that's true it's a strange kind of uh we
*  we're so messy people are so messy and that is that's a very good example of how messy we are
*  are the um i'm i'm now um excuse me uh i hadn't realized for some reason i hadn't realized you were
*  from boston why are so many comics from boston it's a hard place is that what it is mean women
*  drunk guys first of all am i right am i right in thinking there does seem to be like why is it
*  every time i turn around and i listen to some comic and they say well when i was growing up in
*  boston i'm like of course you're from boston there's a lot there's a lot and there are a specific
*  kind of it's like um the audiences there have a very short attention span they uh they're they're
*  not going to coddle you if you suck they will boo you off the stage it's terrible for your self
*  esteem when you're young yeah but it's but it's it doesn't just build character it builds the
*  correct approach towards an audience that you have to realize these people do not look these people
*  got babysitters they they spent money they're here they could have been in a movie they could
*  have done a lot of the recreational activities they've chosen to come to the comedy club stop
*  fucking around get to work like like treat this like this is and the consequences of bombing are
*  horrific right the feeling is it's one of the worst feelings a person can have yeah so wait
*  when was the last time you bombed it's been a while since i bombed bombed but i've had jokes
*  that ate shit yeah well that's this is there's a process that i go through every two years i put
*  out a special and then i write a new one and during the process of writing a new one you don't write
*  it in a vacuum you write it and then i bring that stuff to the comedy store and fortunately
*  with the comedy store you're doing 15 minute sets with you know 15 other talented people so you
*  don't have to be up there for a long time and you get it in the comp the the comedy store also the
*  audience is very unique in that a lot of them understand that they're going to see these
*  guys like dave chapelle and chris rock and work out comedy oh i see they know it's a
*  working problem they understand it and like you could joke around about it like that bit sucks i
*  swear to god that's going to be good in about four months that but that bits in the oven right now
*  because there's concepts that you have that you go there's got to be a way to make this work but
*  that way that i just did is not the way and you always trust the reaction you get in other words
*  you don't tell a joke it bombs and you say actually i think it was their problem and not mine
*  never it's never their problem there's not a chance in hell you can have a bad audience where a good
*  joke doesn't go over because they're drunk and they're not paying attention to their heckling
*  that's possible yeah but that's the anomaly the it's if you have a bit and you think it's a great
*  bit and the audience doesn't laugh they're right you know maybe another audience would laugh maybe
*  you're doing it in the wrong demographic or what have you but most likely that joke sucks
*  and most likely you have these ideas and you need to figure out how to rework them like chris rock
*  told me that that he's that is that famous bit that i love black people i hate the n-word right
*  that bit he said took him a year to work out a full year he said it was bombing he couldn't get
*  it to work right it'll fuck up his act but he knew there was a way to do it and then it became
*  one of the greatest bits of all time it became this incredible classic bit but that was from him
*  grinding just chipping away at it reworking it bringing it on stage it eats shit you bring it
*  back you go over it you ponder it you ask questions of other great writers like what do you think
*  you know and they're like well maybe this maybe that and then you try it again and he keeps doing
*  it and he does does it a hundred times or 200 times and then eventually it becomes bulletproof
*  and then he gets it down to that form that you see it on his comedy special where it's just boom
*  punch line bam punch line boom punch line bam and people like because it's so good but there's a
*  process to doing that and sometimes you have this idea in your head and you're like i think there's
*  something there i just i just got to figure out how to get into their head yeah and then i got to
*  figure out how to make it in a way what's the most palatable way for people to digest this idea
*  because comedy is essentially a mass hypnosis right you're getting the audience to allow you
*  to think for them for a brief period of time and so if you're at your best the punch lines are
*  sneaky they come where you don't expect them you take people on this ride they're assuming
*  because they're letting you think for them that you're a thoughtful person you're not going to
*  make them feel bad for liking you and that's one of the things that people really hate you say
*  something mean or something thoughtless you betray yeah you betrayed their trust because they've
*  trusted you to think for them yeah so you have to be considerate about people's sensibilities and
*  feelings you know and when you're especially when you're breaching a sensitive issue like you have
*  to you have to dance you have to do you have to figure out a way to make this thing compatible
*  to people's thought patterns it's funny i you know i don't i'm not a stand-up comedian but i
*  give a lot of speeches like in in conferences and corporate settings which is a very in some
*  ways a very different animal in some ways quite a similar animal i've been doing it for 20 odd
*  years now and the thing i'm always uh that blows me away is how uh different um audiences are
*  like and one thing that you after doing it for about 10 years you start to get a little bit
*  smarter about reading the room at the beginning to know who they are and what and it's you know it
*  makes a difference like uh there are some some audiences are generous and they'll if they see
*  the the in my case the punch line is not necessarily a joke but it's the the payoff to whatever story i'm
*  telling some people when they see it coming if you think about it as a line they'll reward you the
*  minute they see it they see it off in the horizon yes and they'll be like oh it's coming and they
*  encourage you yes yes some people will wait until the last possible moment and then some people will
*  wait a beat after the punch line is over and then think about it and reward you those three audiences
*  that makes a world of difference in how you tell the story in your expectation going in in you know
*  because if you if you think it's an early rewarding audience and it's a late rewarding audience
*  you can get you'll be 10 minutes in and you're totally bummed out because you think it's a
*  disaster but in fact it's not like and then you get i develop all of these uh short hands about
*  audiences i don't know if they're true or not but in my experience i remember once giving a talk
*  to a group of uh engineers on a early on a monday morning in minneapolis in february so it's freezing
*  it's eight o'clock in the morning they're engineers and they're all white guys they're like
*  norwegians right an incredibly thoughtful interesting audience listen to every word but
*  they are not going to reward you until they have thought about what you said and they'll wait like
*  you know there's a five second lag between whatever payoff you give and their response
*  right if you go i've also given a talk to like a group of teachers in new orleans so there you
*  have a room that is largely female that will be much more diverse so maybe 50 black for example
*  20 Hispanic 30 white just way more they're going to reward you the minute they see it coming
*  they're teachers first of all so their whole thing is about listening rewarding you know seeing the
*  best in something and celebrating it i mean completely different and if you go into the
*  engineers in minneapolis and the teachers in new orleans with the same expectation you're going to
*  it's going to be a disaster yeah right yeah teachers just want to find a way to love you
*  right and and also they're women women i think my experience are far more generous
*  than men as audience i don't know overall yeah probably yeah um but uh so that like and i took
*  a long time to figure that out because you for the longest time i would walk away from someone i
*  would think from some talks and would think i just did committed the worst possible offense
*  you're doing a different thing though it's um your dance is very different right you're first of all
*  you're giving these speeches and you're doing it in these corporate environments you're doing it in
*  conference rooms i would imagine and different kind of halls and yeah uh bright lights yeah i'm
*  doing it at comedy clubs theaters and arenas so comedy clubs they know what they're getting into
*  they're in and it's set up like if you go to the comedy store or the improv right it's a low ceiling
*  it's a great hot mic there's great sound system there's opening acts that warm everybody up before
*  i get there the stage is set and it's uh an environment that it's been established for
*  decades this is a place to go to hear people tell jokes yeah you're doing it you're so you're you
*  don't have an opening act you're doing it they don't even know if you're going to be funny they
*  don't know what you're going to do you're going to talk yeah you're going to talk about things
*  they've been sitting in the same air-conditioned arena for six hours with one small break i mean
*  it's like they're and listening to really doing work like yes you know so it's a yeah it is a
*  very very different yeah it's a super interesting i find it incredibly rewarding and i also find um
*  it uh it sort of uh it reaffirms my uh my my kind of faith in humanity for some reason interesting
*  i i really i'm very very happy that i started doing it years and years ago just to communicate
*  with large groups of people that reaffirms your faith in what way because i'm always struck by how
*  open i i think a lot of the rhetoric in our society now about how divided we are and blah
*  blah i just think it's i think we're divided online i think you talk to people person to person
*  we find a way to find common ground yeah and you go to these meetings and you know that half of the
*  room voted one way another half voted the other way and that it doesn't come up it doesn't block
*  half of you from appreciating half of them appreciating what you're saying they're totally
*  open to to as long as you are respectful and take the time to explain what you think and why
*  and what and how it matters to them then people will listen and engage and ask really good
*  questions and i don't see so funny the washington is divided and online is divided i don't i just
*  don't see it elsewhere maybe i'm not getting an accurate um uh picture of the whole country but in
*  these you know give a talk with a group of whatever educators in new orleans you're not
*  going to you don't see this well i think when it comes to political discussions that's when
*  people get really divided because i think they feel like they're supposed to be divided it was
*  really interesting video that i watched yesterday where donald trump jr was getting heckled by these
*  alt-right characters for not being right wing enough i was like holy shit like this this but i
*  took a lot of pleasure in watching that play out not because i want donald jr to get heckled but
*  because i this is what i've always said there's people that are just extreme and it doesn't
*  matter if they're in antifa or if they're in the proud boys if they're far left or far right it's
*  the same thing they're just finding an ideology and they're taking it to the the extremist level
*  and they're angry that people aren't woke enough or they're finding an ideology and they take it
*  to the furthest level and they're angry at people that aren't separatists that aren't white supremacists
*  they're angry at people that like mexicans at all any mexicans i mean there's there's people that
*  are that racist that are mad at subtle racism they're mad at people that there's just people
*  that are extreme and you can't make everyone happy it is impossible and some people don't want to be
*  happy they want to find ways in which you're not woke enough their their concern is not the
*  overwhelming good of the world harmony peace love compatibility communication and community
*  that's not what their concern is their concern is finding ways you're wrong so finding ways that
*  they're right in ways that you're that you're wrong so they'll they'll find some reason why
*  woke enough so it he he my response to that was was slightly different although i think a lot of
*  what you're saying is accurate the reason they got upset with him was that he wouldn't do a q a yes
*  okay yes okay now as someone who's on his book tour and has done been doing this for 20 years let me
*  just say you have to do the q a the q a is symbolically crucial it's like everyone says okay
*  everyone sees you get up there and you do your prepared bit and i was like okay fine i know you
*  can do your prepared bit but you're asking me to spend 28 on a book and what i want to know is
*  are you someone who is meaningfully engaged in the ideas that you're talking about in your book
*  right so q a is where you prove that to me yes prove that you're thoughtful prove you care about
*  the stuff prove that you wrote this and someone else didn't prove all those things yeah he wouldn't
*  do it i'm sorry kind of weird because he just did the view which is like the worst way to have a q
*  and a i had fun on the view but but i'm saying in that situation there's everyone's talking
*  everybody over everybody yeah you you really don't get a chance to express full thoughts
*  yes yeah if you could do if you could do the view he can certainly do q and a at at uc what was it
*  ucla right forgotten was it was it really where was it but what was interesting too is that what
*  he was using as an excuse was that the the the left wing media is going to take his quotes
*  and take him out of context dude i have no sympathy for him well in that case no didn't make any sense
*  it doesn't make any sense like any sense just say something intelligent and meaningful and you'll be
*  taken seriously that's the way the world works well there's a whole video i mean if someone takes it
*  out of context you could always like show the entire video hey that's out of context here's
*  why is he playing the helpless crowd he's probably exhausted well i mean i as someone who's in
*  you know like i said in the middle of the book i got no sympathy for that either that's what you
*  that's what you do listen i have no sympathy for him either in that in this case i do not i think
*  it's it's but i found it very amusing his wife or a girlfriend i've forgotten what she is uh which
*  of those things she is she she then disses the crowd about how the only the only way they could
*  get dates is online because nobody would do you see that it's like rule number two after rule number
*  one is do the q a rule number two is don't dis the audience by by telling them they're all losers like
*  it's just not what do you well there's people you know that's a thing where people want to just get
*  get you you got them so they want to get you people are booing fuck you you're a loser no no no no
*  you're a loser yeah you know it's it's just noises instead of going love love you have a good one
*  guys take care but instead you're right do the q a instead don't don't don't even you know it's
*  not that hard to answer questions i think there's a real problem with answering questions in front
*  of a crowd though where people screaming out things i think real thoughtful conversation should
*  be had one-on-one and it's if like we you and i are having this conversation it's great but if
*  there was a third person there talking to we would have to work that guy in or that girl in
*  we'd have to figure out when she's talking when we're talking and if you get another person okay
*  now you got a real problem now you have four people and it's it's very difficult if you watch
*  those panel shows some for some reason the network news shows post-election pre-election their
*  election cover they've still haven't figured that out they'll get seven people on they think it's
*  like more than merrier and like the like the pre-game shows on nfl on sunday like they got
*  so many guys each one of them says one sentence yes and they're talking over each other and
*  everybody's trying to get a sound bite off everyone has this prepared thing this zinger i'm going to
*  get that trump guy with this one and they're ready for it and they're trying to interject it and
*  someone's talking over them excuse me i'm talking and then it degrades wait i want to use the
*  opportunity of being on the show to issue a challenge to donald trump jr oh like just call
*  me up don uh and uh i will accompany you on your book tour and interview on you on stage
*  respectfully we'll do let's let's do a q a you and me i'll ask you questions i'll do it do you want
*  to do that yes that's something you want to do why do you want to do that i think it'll be fun
*  what do you think would be fun about it well i think it would be interesting without saying anything
*  that's going to get him to not do it okay no no so let's be clear about a couple things okay this
*  would not be a stunt i'm not doing it to do gotcha i would like to read his book thoughtfully
*  and engage with him in the ideas in it and do see for myself exactly thing i was talking about before
*  is is he does he want to meaningfully engage with those ideas with someone who doesn't necessarily
*  share them right right his book be for it's i would ask for an hour and we can do it in lieu
*  of audience q a if he likes i will just have a conversation with him on stage so just a
*  conversation in front of an audience oh that would be interesting i mean don jr see that would you
*  pay to see that yeah i would let's do it his book title is the same as my 2016 netflix title
*  it's triggered i got there first though don i beat you by three years that's question number one i'll
*  say don i noticed the title of your book is the same as why are you biting joe rogan stuff what's
*  going on over there he probably didn't know it existed bill maher almost released his hbo specials
*  triggered too really yeah he was going to call it triggered too but at least he sent me an email
*  apologizing you know you want to get it you want to get there early well it's you know it's not my
*  term i wouldn't really care if bill used it or if donald trump jr used it i mean he did obviously
*  is he don or don he's don't people call him don uh that's a good question isn't he donald trump jr
*  online but i think they distinguish the dad is donald oh so they call him i don't know that's
*  one of the things i could ask him presumably in our face off maybe we should do why am i limiting
*  it to an hour oh yeah let's go rogan rules let's go like two hours yes me and don jr and in the
*  second hour we really get into it yeah because that's what happens you could keep it together
*  people can keep it together for 45 minutes you can't keep it together for three hours
*  in three hours you know who a person is you know i once gave a talk in columbia and the columbians
*  are uh take themselves in the best way very seriously right they consider themselves the
*  most cultured people to america yeah and they're and they're they think they speak the most
*  beautiful spanish and i'm told they they may as well they may well do and so i was talking with
*  was going to go this little kind of uh lecture tour of major columbian cities and i was talking
*  to the organizer and the standard question he asked was well how long i should talk for
*  some period of time and then we'll do q a well how long do you think uh i should talk and the guy
*  goes uh i don't know how three hours he was dead serious and you realize like this is the same so
*  when fidel castro would give those six hour speeches you realize it's not just i mean castro
*  a little bit crazy but there's also there are there are cultures that have an expectation that
*  if you're going to go and hear somebody speak it's not going to be over in 40 minutes right you have
*  to commit to the to the experience and they literally wanted me to start at nine and end at
*  weren't the early campaign speeches for people running for president in the early days of this
*  country weren't they like that as well i believe there were long affairs yeah and then then you
*  get the gettysburg address which is what is it six minutes or something so there's oh no no or is it
*  the inaugural i've forgotten one of lincoln's most famous speeches very brief is incredibly brief and
*  you realize in that context where people are used to hours and hours and hours what an extraordinary
*  i mean it is think about lincoln as a kind of um badass uh entertainer not entertainer performer
*  so he walks into a world where everyone's thinking they're going to be there for two hours
*  he sits up there and he's done in five minutes she realized what a just a power move that is it's
*  fantastic like it is a good move imagine him imagine him so he comes in to his like aids and
*  says this holds it up and it's you know you've seen it in the in the lincoln monument on the
*  mall it's two paragraphs you know for what is it i'm not i'm canadian four score seven years ago
*  yes blah blah blah two paragraphs they must have been like what these people traveled by
*  horse and cart four hours do you speak yeah right yeah that's it such a great move it is a good
*  move right we're still talking about it today yeah it's unbelievably beautiful i every time i go
*  to the lincoln monument and read that i am moved to tears it is insanely gorgeous bros as a writer
*  you must appreciate like economy of words using the right words in the right place and having the
*  the right impact and you know my friend ari he has a um a piece of paper that he has glued to the top
*  of his laptop from hemmingway it's a quote says the first draft of everything is shit
*  it's true and there's something about someone nailing writing someone just writing something
*  that you go god damn we just fucking nailed that yeah yeah there you have to mean the trick is
*  always even though it's false you have to you have to hold in your heart the conviction that there
*  is a way to say this perfectly and beautifully yeah right you you so even when you're in
*  draft one or two or five and it's not there yet you have to believe it's possible and the minute
*  you lose that belief that it's possible it's over when when you write do you write on paper first
*  and then start typing like how do you how do you the opposite type oh and then print it out because
*  there's there's certain things structural things you can only see i think when it's on the page
*  and you've kind of put all the pages in front print it out though you don't write longhand at all do
*  you print it out and then well i would know then i will annotate that draft uh with a pen so i will
*  do longhand absolutely there's a there there's a i i'm very i think that our thinking is actually
*  quite sensitive to the um the mode that we're using yes so you think differently when you're
*  typing on a keyboard than when you have a pen in your hand and i think it's neither not one is
*  better than the other they're both good they're just different and yes makes sense to use both
*  yeah i agree it's particularly for me um my notes before i go on stage i always write out
*  longhand i mean write out um i write my comedy though all my thoughts essays i write them all
*  out on a keyboard i write typing and then when i'm about to go on stage like the hour or so before
*  a show i'll write out index cards and sometimes i'll write out entire bits if there's a bit i'm
*  working on and it's kind of new i'll write it all out and it helps tremendously with my memory
*  yeah but something about writing things out but writing to me on paper is so slow it's so slow
*  for me to actually write the words for me to get the thoughts out i want to get the thoughts out
*  with a keyboard because i can just type i can do it quickly i can get it done what i don't do what
*  a lot of people do do is voice to text i don't do that never doing that no no but wait i have a
*  question that occurred to me when you were saying you were talking about that schedule that you're on
*  that you do a every two years every two years so are you starting when you when you have to sit
*  down and write new material are you starting cold or do you have in the previous year were you kind
*  of building up little bits and pieces that you're now putting together yeah i always have little
*  stuff that i lay aside like i have uh i have just pages and pages of shit that never went anywhere
*  so i'll go back over that and go man this maybe this and take that out there and then i'll
*  introduce all so usually there's a window of time like uh say if i my special i film it in july it
*  might not air until august or until october rather so um in that window i have those four months to
*  try to create material so what i'll be able to do in that window say i have a bit that i know works
*  because it's on the special i'll do that bit because the people haven't seen it yet and then
*  after that bit i will sandwich in some new stuff and i'll try to make that new stuff come alive
*  and then i'll add a bit after that that i know is good and then i'll sandwich in some new so i'll
*  make like a like a club sandwich of shitty jokes it's sandwiched in between like legit bits and
*  then one of them will catch fire and i'm like all right this one's alive now when you go back can you
*  see a trajectory in your comedy like when you go back and look at something you were a joke that
*  you may have done i don't know eight years ago do you how do you react to it does it i don't
*  i don't but if i did i probably somewhat i would i would definitely see flaws oh god that's too
*  wordy or that's that's clunky or that's forced or i don't like how i acted that out or i don't like
*  maybe that wasn't done yet you know there's a there's a cooking period and everybody has
*  a different take on it and i've been my friend anthony jessalnek has a three-year cycle and he
*  might be right he he takes the first year he just does clubs in la and develops material the second
*  year he goes on the road and he goes to comedy clubs in the road the third year he takes that
*  to theaters and then he's ready to to film at the end of the third year yeah and you know his last
*  special was excellent but he's just very good comic very good writer but his process might be
*  right there's some guys that were doing it on a one-year cycle they were doing a new special
*  every year and i don't think that's right that's that's got to be yeah it's too hard it's not just
*  too hard the material suffers it's half cooked a lot of is gooey on the inside it's just not ready
*  yeah it's just not done i mean some of the bits are really good then some of the bits aren't and
*  you have to fill the whole hour and the problem is also when you're doing a a special every year
*  you have your own audience so those people love you so they're laughing at stuff that's not even
*  that good like you have to you have to be doing that in front of a bunch of people that didn't
*  expect to see you yeah you know and that's that's hard to do so a lot of a lot of weird tricks you
*  could play on yourself as a comic you know you could think you're better than you are or that
*  the bits are better than they are or that you you don't have to worry about things anymore you
*  don't have to grind you don't have to throw yourself into the gladiator pit that is the
*  comedy store on a tuesday night but you do you do there's no other way if you want to be top notch
*  you have to do the things that top notch people do there's a i mean there's no there's no books
*  written on this there's no university course but all the best people will tell you there's a process
*  this is the process you know yeah it's one of the weird art forms in that no one teaches it
*  there's literally anybody who does teach it is terrible there's no one who can
*  i've never seen like a real world-class headliner who sells out theaters who teaches a course on
*  comedy i've never seen it you know and i couldn't teach you how to do it anyway because your way of
*  doing it would be very different than jamie's way of doing it which would be very different than
*  stephen wright which is very different than sam kinnison it's like everybody's got their own
*  weird little thing that makes them funny it's a matter of what is the process how do you how do
*  you get it out who is your candidate for i always love in any particular field there's the insider's
*  choice and then there's the popular choice like the most hilarious one is if you ask an architect
*  who their favorite architect is 99 times out of 100 you will never have heard of that it's always
*  some obscure german guy from like the 30 you know or it's some like you know experimental
*  dutch guy who did he's done one building and it's like amazing if you know it's like some
*  he did a church outside of antwerp and it was it blew everyone's mind so who's the who's who's your
*  insider's uh i would say the insider a pic is david tell because david tell is probably one of
*  the greatest comics of all time it doesn't get enough love because he has no social media presence
*  he wears the same hat and the same shirt and the same jacket and the same pants every day
*  he has no thought whatsoever about his look all he does is just write new and better jokes
*  constantly he's one of the most prolific comics but he still he'll still have a hard time selling
*  places out and it doesn't make any sense although lately he and jeff ross have done this thing
*  called bumping mics where they go on stage and they do they sort of work together and they talk
*  shit and like jeff will say something funny and then dave will say something funny and dave will
*  do his bits and jeff will make fun of them and they'll they'll go and it's really entertaining
*  and they do a series of shows doing that and that has elevated his profile and for that i'm very
*  very thankful how long was he sort of in the wilderness he's been out there forever he used
*  to have a show on comedy central way back in the day called what was it called insomniac yeah
*  insomniac thank you and it was like he would go out after shows and they would you know go do
*  weird things in these towns and he would get black out drunk and he was an alcoholic at the time
*  and he was getting hammered drunk and then he quit he got sober and rare in comedy that someone gets
*  sober and becomes much better but that's what happened with dave he's a much better comic now
*  than even was then and what so and what's your when you see someone like that perform
*  and you're you know someone who's extraordinarily talented and good what is your emotional reaction
*  to it do you run home and re-examine all the stuff you're doing do i mean what's it certainly
*  inspiring yeah when someone's really good i always want to write that that is the feeling i always
*  look god i gotta go to work i gotta get to work but also i've cherished and held on to like a like
*  a sacred ember that i'm trying to keep keep alive my fan my my um my my love of being a fan of
*  stand-up comedy like i like watching it i'm a fan i love it like i like going to see it like to this
*  day like i'm working with my friend joey diaz tonight who i think is the funniest guy alive
*  i'm happy i'm gonna go see comedy i'm gonna see him like that i'd still like watching i still enjoy
*  i didn't for a while in the early days it was too i was too ambitious and i was judging myself
*  versus them and if someone had a really great joke i wish i thought of it instead of enjoying it
*  i go god why didn't i think of that and that's a it's poison and then i realized luckily well
*  i got very lucky that i figured this out early on like you know a couple two or three years and i
*  was like i used to love comedy like why am i not loving comedy because i'm doing comedy that's the
*  dumbest fucking thing in the world the reason why i got in the stand-up comedy was because i
*  loved watching it now all of a sudden i don't like it because i'm jealous or um um you know or it
*  makes me compare myself to them and i don't like the feeling or it makes me you know what is that
*  that's so dumb and then i realized it thankfully and i i had a shift and i caught myself yeah and
*  i have managed to cherish and and nurture that being a fan that feeling of being an actual fan
*  the enjoyment of stand-up comedy i nurture that so that that to me is critical so when a guy like
*  david tells on stage i can enjoy it i enjoy it i just can i can sit there like an audience member
*  and just laugh but are you and the question is when you sit in an audience of a of seven days
*  you're singing out with watching david tell okay are you experiencing him differently than the
*  audiences because you're professional like him i'm sure somewhat but i try to shut down the
*  analysis part of my brain as much as possible i try to shut down like why did he write it like
*  that why doesn't he do it this way i try to just be a fan i try to just watch you know but i'm sure
*  i know some things are coming or i know the way i would do it or i know dave very well so i know
*  how he would do it i'm sure there's some sort of a difference between but that's like the same as a
*  musician right if you're a musician if you're a guitarist and you're watching an amazing guitarist
*  even though they're really good you're probably like hmm okay i see what he's doing he's doing
*  this thing like you understand technically i can't turn i was my worry as i get older is that
*  increasingly my reactions are simply versions of i would have done it that's not how i would have
*  done it right right as opposed to so if say paman comes to me for advice my first and i think about
*  oh that's here's the advice i'd like to give on this piece of writing my first someone actually
*  was talking a friend of mine yesterday brought to me an essay she's working on incredibly interesting
*  um uh essay about um the role of women in cinema and i give out so we're walking around and i'm
*  telling her my response to it and after i give it then i first thought was wait did i just say
*  um if i was doing it i was i would have done it this way in other words did i you know did i just
*  simply impose my own um standards and preferences on her which is not advice that's actually the
*  that's the worst thing what you have to do is inhabit her mind and fix it according to her
*  own intentions and yeah and i i my i'm constantly sort of paranoid about the notion that i am not
*  being truly empathetic at the moment of giving advice i'm just projecting my own um and i think
*  that's that's something that happens when you get so when you become so sure of your own methods and
*  professional personality you know that's the kind of i wouldn't have done that when i was
*  25 because i didn't know what it meant to be to write a malcolm gladwell thing where i was just
*  kind of reacting as a human being but now i kind of have this thing burned into my skull yeah you
*  have a method i have a method i mean i try to mix it up but it probably still right and everybody's
*  method is different particularly with writing right everybody's method is very different
*  yeah everybody's voice is very different there's some key things with comedy one of them is as i
*  said before the economy of words that's very important in comedy if you see the punchline
*  coming too far out it loses impact with the more words you use but if you can get the punchline to
*  the people before they see the punchline coming it has a gigantic impact that's what my friend joey
*  diaz does better than anybody he he does he does it better than anybody he sneaks things in on you
*  yeah yeah um this reminds me along these very lines i've often thought this was the one of the
*  greatest jokes i'd like to see you probably know this joke a lot in terms of economy this is the
*  most economical great joke i've ever heard in my life and it's from oh my god i forgot his name
*  this is appalling i've forgotten his name uh and i knew him uh what does he look like
*  he was uh he was in a lake bell movie um lake bell yeah uh he's an incredible he had his own show
*  on oh it'll come to me the joke was um uh you know those signs in bathrooms in restaurants
*  uh you know all staff should wash their hands after using the bathroom right especially earl
*  it's so it's two words that transform is that ricky gerbase no no it's um especially earl
*  especially so it's like i cannot go into a bathroom anymore without thinking of that joke
*  it's so fantastic it's like you know you like it takes this you know i don't need to explain
*  the joke to you it's just a mate two words have created this lasting image of earl it's subverted
*  the whole bathroom thing it's it's i can't go to the bathroom in your head it's burned into my hand
*  who is it jamie i'm looking at it's i cannot believe i can't it's so humiliating i can't
*  remember his name um it was a new york kind of indy comic okay um but i just like that rogal
*  uh no but we're getting close you're in close it'll come to me um but he um but that's like
*  i'm i am amazed by the two words part like it's just that you can do it with two words just
*  strikes me it's the same reason why i am obsessed i've always had an incredible
*  love of television commercials really yes because the good ones the idea that you can
*  communicate something emotionally powerful or funny or meaningful in 30 seconds is so badass like
*  30 seconds is nothing right and there are people whose job it is to communicate and some of the
*  like not the run of the mill like 80 percent of them are relatively straightforward they don't
*  but there are there's a handful that are just magnificent there was one uh i mean there's a
*  million examples of great ones but there was one really beautiful one um which was a heineken ad
*  oh god now i've forgotten again uh the song they used uh where a bunch of kids jump in the back of
*  a cab and they start singing a bell div devo song um and uh the cab driver they're all young
*  cool hipsters they're all crammed in the back and they're all like a little bit tipsy and the cab
*  driver's this like crusty old school guy and it comes to the chorus and he chimes in and it's
*  just this moment it's 30 seconds and it's fantastic because you don't you're not expecting that you're
*  thinking right you see the crusty old it's like a boston cab driver right like some grizzled irish
*  guy who's like 70 years old and these three and you think oh you must hate these kids because
*  they're young and beautiful and they're tipsy and it's a friday night and he's driving a cab
*  and then the song comes on the radio and they all start singing along and they're kind of drunken
*  way and then he just joins in and this is right there with him and it's fantastic and it's 30
*  seconds like somebody a really great and funny like remember the wendy's lady where's the beef
*  oh yeah you'll never forget that one forget that three words where's the beef and an image an old
*  lady screaming opening up a cheeseburger looking for the beef yeah yeah look at i mean how could
*  you not how can you not take off your hat to the person who came up with that yeah right if i gave
*  you if you're if you're sat with 30 seconds it's hard yeah it's suddenly really really hard
*  right and you have to make a point you're trying to sell something yeah trying to sell jerry
*  seinfeld was going to open up an advertising agency for a while he he had thoughts about i
*  know he had done a couple of commercials and apparently he had written some of the commercials
*  and he decided that he was going to write commercials yeah he was going to do that i think
*  he's got so much seinfeld money he's like fuck that why am i working what am i doing
*  i've got a billion dollars in the bank i'll just go buy a couple more portions i mean his
*  his he doesn't just have a billion dollars in the bank he has more coming in coming in yeah it's
*  like constantly coming in yeah there's no it's like a yeah it just seems to to does he did he get
*  does larry david have the same deal that he does i do not know yeah i would love to know that i
*  would like to know that too i don't think he does i don't i would imagine he doesn't but i think
*  he's probably extremely wealthy but he has in my opinion the most underrated sitcom of all time
*  and curb your enthusiasm there's times that i've watched that show where i've been literally
*  weeping laughing like holding my side laughing yeah and it's so odd the way he does it you know
*  do you know how he writes things yeah they have like a place where they like okay you're trying
*  to sell me a toaster and jamie's trying to stop me from buying that toaster but you're you're mad
*  at jamie and you're trying to be persuasive at me at the same time that's how they write so it's
*  they just do multiple takes with really talented people and they find magic yeah it's i mean it's
*  crazy how open-ended it i've talked to uh different guys that have been on the show yeah you know about
*  how they do it it's it's amazing yeah that you have to love the the amount of trust you have to
*  have in your fellow actors yes yeah uh but it's kind of that's lovely yes particularly contrasted
*  with this incredibly tightly controlled anal writing process right that's in place in so many
*  of those shows yes yes yeah but it's also why that show seems so organic yeah you know i mean
*  there's talking over it sounds real it's like you know i had trouble watching it because it was too
*  real to me i was just cringing with all of the social awkward he's just constructing one socially
*  awkward situation after another right and i couldn't because i couldn't distinguish it from real
*  life yes i just i just couldn't bear it it's too much it was too much that's what's so good about
*  it did you ever see the one where he has uh he's over the rapper's house crazy eyes killer you see
*  the the rapper has scarface playing 24 7 i mean it's larry david with this rapper it is fucking
*  magic man it's magic it's so good he's a genius yeah oh he's a legitimate genius there's no doubt
*  about that and you know he's also like a real legit oddball like he drives a prius you know like
*  he is that schlubby guy he's probably worth 500 million dollars or something crazy but you know
*  he's that kind of schlubby guy that's the way he i mean that's who he is yeah those guys were in
*  am i right they were in new york like barely scraping by forever yeah yeah well he was a
*  stand-up and um he and jerry knew each other from back then and you know he was a weird stand-up
*  like it just was an acquired taste it wasn't it wasn't you know he wasn't yeah burned down comedy
*  clubs who which comics are not to your taste i'm not saying that you don't like i mean that are not
*  to your taste that is whose humor just doesn't kind of i don't know of any i mean nothing i could
*  think of offhand i don't i wouldn't pay attention one of the things i've gotten really good at as
*  i've gotten older is not paying any attention to things i don't like yeah just just letting it
*  just slide right out of my brain and onto the floor i'm not interested it's just i i spent
*  so much time when i was younger and stupider worrying about things i don't like being upset
*  at things i don't like well that sucks why do people like that what the fuck's wrong with them
*  and then realize like what a gigantic waste of resources that is and what just a huge waste of
*  energy yeah that uh i don't care anymore you know as long as they're not stealing material as long
*  as they're not make you know doing something terrible to other comics victimizing as long
*  as they're not doing that i really don't care it's like they're doing well good luck the zen yeah i
*  try i mean it's not i'm just not i mean it's not 100 it's uh it's constantly a work in process
*  but my philosophy is rooted in some sort of a pragmatic understanding of how my own brain
*  works yeah like you don't you only have so much time and you only have so much energy
*  and if you're wasting your time on things that you don't like that have nothing to do with you
*  people like something like and that's how i feel about music and and movies and so many things
*  there's so many things that i just don't like them at all but some people do i mean you know
*  some people will that i think their music is dog shit but they'll have a full staple center of
*  people rocking out well i must be wrong it's not me it's not them it's just like everyone's different
*  people have different tastes some people like really cheesy rom-coms they like it they really
*  enjoy it they seek comfort in this movie where you know it's going to work out in the end it's
*  going to it's not like in the end a fucking meteor is going to land on the building and kill everybody
*  and the the the screen is going to splatter with blood because uh you know their bodies explode
*  you're not going to see that in this movie in this movie everything's going to work out great it's
*  there's like why that i have that feeling about law and order in fact one of my i have no idea
*  why anyone would ever watch that show and one of my secret goals in life is at some point i would
*  like to be appointed executive producer of law and order and i want to do ones that completely
*  subvert the franchise so we get you through you're all everyone knows exactly how every one of those
*  shows is always going to turn out right and i want to get to minute 47 and then just go on some savage
*  u-turn that just appalls and outrages absolutely and then i'll be done i'm just i'm quitting and
*  i'm walking off the set shut the black yeah what the fuck and don't tell anybody that malcolm gladwell's
*  taken over no yeah it'd be totally i would push just gently push dick wolf aside and say let me
*  have this one and we're gonna like completely and we'll have it you know the the villain
*  the will actually be one of the prosecutors that's what we'll do or something right along those lines
*  and every episode ends like no country for old men style where the it's over you're like what the
*  fuck exactly what happened but there's something there's a drug in those where they're comforting
*  and that people know that the bad guy's gonna get caught and the good guy i don't know this is a
*  random thought but i don't know any men who watch them and i've come to the belief that they are
*  there's something they're actually for women and there are a very comforting um kind of reassuring
*  fantasy about how the world works that that you know there the system is so i had can i tell you
*  my this is an incredibly complicated theory that i developed once about these kinds of things
*  um oh so there's we all know what a western is yes a western is where is uh conceptually a world
*  in which there is no law and order and a man shows up and imposes personally law and order on the
*  territory the community right so there is also a eastern what is an eastern
*  and eastern is a place where by contrast is a story where there are uh let me get this straight
*  there's four types the eastern is where there is uh law and order there so there are institutions
*  of justice but they are uh uh have been subverted by people from within so an eastern would be the
*  serpico is an eastern it's a crooked cop who is it's the bad apple who has you know screwed up
*  there are lots tons and tons of hollywood movies are are easterns um the northern is the case where
*  law and order exists and law and order is uh morally righteous system works law the show
*  law and order is a northern it's a functioning apparatus of justice which reliably and accurately
*  produces um the right the correct result in confronting criminality every single day when
*  it's on tv the southern is where the uh the entire weight the southern is all john grisham
*  novels are southern they are where the entire apparatus is corrupt and where the reformer is
*  not an insider but an outsider so in in every john grisham novel the same they all proceed i
*  love john grisham to be clear but they all proceed from the same premise which is the system is
*  rotten to the core and only this white knight who comes in from the outside can save us so in the
*  western there is no system in the northern there's a system and it's fantastic in the uh in the
*  eastern the system is reformed from within but in the southern the system has to be reformed from
*  without huh that's my complicated so i feel like anything you can place all art about law and order
*  about the criminal world criminal justice into one of these four categories and the so the brits
*  love the northern so what is uh you know uh all of the uh the famous british detective stories
*  are always charlotte combs is a northern it's like the system is like and the you know that
*  there's no corruption in the police department they may be bumbling and charlotte's got to help
*  them out but no one's you know off on some there's no there's never a case where there's a rotten
*  cop who's selling out every uh is there a modern version of the western because westerns all seem
*  to take place between the time of like 15 1600 and 1880 there is so lee child do you read the
*  jack reacher novels um by leech child no but i watched one of the movies those are westerns
*  those are westerns there's you'll never the whole thing about a western is can you find the police
*  officer you know i i challenge you to find a police officer in a leech odd novel they're
*  not nowhere to be found reacher is a retired the hero is a retired army investigator he's not even
*  in the army anymore and he's just roaming around the country solving crimes on his own and he'll
*  confront some massive criminal conspiracy and he never calls the cops right that's the whole premise
*  that's so western you can't call the cops in the classic western because there's no costs to be
*  found right you're in montana on the border but reacher it's a it's a 21st century western so he
*  doesn't call the cops because he doesn't feel like it it's just like they never appear like and he
*  just murders everyone on his own and then he gets on the train and goes to the next place they're
*  amazing i love them so much do you write fiction no never i mean i i read so many thrillers i read
*  like i mean i probably read uh how many do i read a year 50 60 70 really i read you know when you
*  go in the airport that's a lot you know the hudson news and you see all those there's a whole like
*  wall of those thrillers i have read every single one of them that means you're reading more than
*  one a week yeah easy yeah wow and then i read on top of that i read my serious stuff but i devour
*  people send me publishers send me these things in the mail just because i don't have to buy them
*  anyway they just they know that i'm obsessed like lee child's although he didn't with his most recent
*  lee child's publisher for years you'd send me galleys the minute it didn't send you one
*  not recently what happened i think they've forgotten me they fucked up they fucked up
*  what are you consuming all of it reading or does it any of it book on tape no i'm reading at all
*  yeah i mean i'm reading them in breakneck speed and i'm but i do there's a guy i love i love one
*  of my favorites is steven hunter who writes the you know they made some movies of his stuff bobbly
*  swagger these sniper movies they're fantastically well written and those the minute he comes out
*  with a new one i i read at the instant i mean i have to it's just like they're just such delights
*  i've never heard oh he's so good really yeah so good anything with the word sniper in it is
*  generally one of his books oh and uh movie shooter with mark walberg was one yeah i didn't see that
*  was it good yeah it was pretty good yeah but they're the books are fantastic i would recommend them
*  wholeheartedly um how do you have the time to read all these books uh well that's my job not reading
*  thrillers but but my job is reading books literature yeah um you know i read very quickly i suppose but i
*  uh i don't watch a lot of tv i just watch a little bit of sports i don't really watch much so it's
*  not a lot competing for my attention but um you know i know the book that i will read tonight at
*  dinner so when you set out to write a book do you have a premise stewing in your head where it's just
*  like throbbing where you're like that's it that's the one or do you halfway in i'll get it i'll start
*  oh so you start a book with a little kernel there'll be a story i'm interested in i'll write
*  it up and then i'll see where can i go from there um like there'll be every one of my books began
*  as a very very simple one chapter but i didn't i didn't know what surrounded the chapter but there
*  was something uh in the book in talking to strangers i got interested in these spy stories
*  these that story of a tale of of anna montez the cuban spy who rises to the top of the
*  american intelligence establishment i began with that and i went and talked to the guy who caught
*  her and he had such a fantastic interview with him and that just got me incredibly excited and
*  that got me this whole thing about here's a woman spying in plain sight for castro at the top of
*  the american intelligence establishment for 10 years no one catches her even though she's not
*  some master spy she has the codes that she's using in her purse and the radio she's using in
*  a shoe box in her closet like we're not talking about james bond right and like she does it and
*  no one even comes close to her they all like really really smart people and that was such a
*  fascinating notion that even in the most sophisticated and by definition paranoid agency
*  in the american government they're spies that get away with all the stuff like do you think
*  anybody ever gets away with it to retirement and then has never oh absolutely in fact really so i
*  go and i interview the guy who caught this woman in montez and i'm leaving to go back to drive back
*  he's in a small town in wisconsin and i you know as one does i turned off my tape recorder and put
*  it in my bag and i'm walking back to my car he says i'll walk you to your car it's like okay and
*  we're walking down the street and he begins to tell me another story even better than the one
*  i went there to talk to him about which of course my tape recorder is no longer running so i don't
*  have the story anymore what the fuck and the story was basically oh there's another bigger spy out
*  there i now know i now realize there is this one out there right now well this was three years ago
*  there was one three years ago that's out there was actually just retired the implication was
*  they're still there they're bigger and i really it was one of those things where when he put
*  together all the pieces to catch this one woman anna montez he realized oh there's someone else
*  and then he retired whoa he's like the implication was he couldn't get anyone else interested in
*  finding the other bigger one but he knew there was someone out there but he didn't know specifically
*  who they were no he knew there was someone i forgot of course because it was this tragic thing where
*  i turned off my go find him get back how didn't you just hold on stop stop stop let me put this
*  back on do you think you would have told you the story if your tape recorder was running
*  don't think so oh fuck it's kind of great it's a great he was incredibly that's where siri comes
*  in hey siri record this that's right he was it's but i think you know if you're in that world you
*  just assume yeah they all assume they're spies like we have them we have them in theirs so it's
*  like they're not as maybe they're not as worked up about it as we are i don't know yeah there's
*  there was a story recently where iran assassinated some people that they suspected were cia spies
*  and i always wondered like how many people are spies and like you know homeland style living
*  in some other country assimilating into their culture getting jobs in organizations even in
*  terrorist groups yeah infiltrating what a crazy way to live your life well there was a story i
*  told in one of my podcast episodes richness history season two i think that i ran across i
*  love reading these memoirs of like mid-level retired intelligence officers and there's tons
*  of them and people don't really read them and i love they're just because invariably like in the
*  middle of the book they'll tell you some they'll just drop some crazy story and this guy it was the
*  former general council the cia wrote his memoirs really interesting memoirs in the middle he tells
*  a story about how the cia cia a guy who was a really big deal terrorist in the 70s and 80s
*  really big deal has a change of heart and comes to the cia and says i no longer believe in what i'm
*  doing i'd like to work for you and proceeds to work for the cia for some period of time unknown
*  period of time and he's the he's way up high in middle eastern terrorist organization and that
